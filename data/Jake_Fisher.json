He'd had chemotherapy and was in the hospital to have a bone dissection. However, when his scans showed that the chemotherapy hadn't worked to shrink the tumor. They wanted to cut off his leg, but he said that he needed it in order to dance. He danced in the hospital to show him why he couldn't have his leg amputated.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]], [[Callie Torres]], and [[Alex Karev]] researched other options for him. Alex eventually found a case where they'd removed the affected bone, dosed it with radiation, and them put it back in the leg. They planned to do it for Jake. It was risky, but they'd monitor him to make sure the cancer wasn't coming back. His parents acknowledged the risk, but let him decide. He decided to have the procedure. It was successful and his post-ob labs were good.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis parents were highly supportive of his dancing.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 15 at the time of his cancer treatment.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fisher, Jake}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}]}}}}
