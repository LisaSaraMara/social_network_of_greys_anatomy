After a tour bus was thrown off a cliff during a tornado, Sarah and her family were told they had a donor for her, for all three organs. Before Sarah was taken into surgery, she said that if she died instead of being buried or cremated, she wanted her family to turn her into a tree, so she could fight climate change and helped the world instead of contributing to pollution.\n\nSarah's transplant went forward and was successful. When she woke up after the surgery, she asked to see her family, but was told she'd need to wait a few days to heal more before that would be possible. She also asked to thank her donor's family.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe is close with her parents and brother.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martinez, Cara}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S19 Characters]]"}]}}}}
