When they recovered from the initial shock, Owen ordered Amy and [[Vinicius Velo]] to help set up a triage area outside the hospital to prepare for the incoming wounded. She later reported that it was quiet except a few firefighters. At the end of the day, Owen thanked them for their help.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a corporal in the U.S. Army.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sacilotto, Amy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}]}}}}
