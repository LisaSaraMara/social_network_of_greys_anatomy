He was taken into surgery, but his scar tissue made resection nearly impossible, so they closed and told them he was going to die. Angela was upset and begged them to try something else. [[Izzie Stevens]], inspired by her own recent battle with cancer, encouraged [[Owen Hunt]] to try another option. He agreed, but Randy died in surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was dating [[Randy Helsby]] until his death. They'd been together for eight years. He planned to propose, but he got distracted by his cancer. He had the ring in his mouth guard case. They had bought a condo together and rescued a puppy. Randy decided before his surgery not to wait any longer to propose, but he died before he got the chance. After his surgery, Angela was told to look in his mouth guard case.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Angela}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]"}]}}}}
