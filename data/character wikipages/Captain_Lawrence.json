Lawrence and the rest of station 19 responded to the call. They quickly put out the fire. ''(\"[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\")''\n\n===Pruitt's Death===\nLawrence, [[Snuffy Souza]], and [[Charlie Irwin]] came to Station 19 with Pruitt to tell stories to the current team and play cards. When part of the team was called out to free people trapped in a storage unit, they grabbed the radio and listened to see how well trained the team was. They discussed every call any of them made, as the call progressed from trapped civilians to a fire. When they heard over the radio that several firefighters became trapped in the storage facility and were running out of air, Pruitt abruptly got up and left. They continued to listen to the radio and heard that Pruitt was going up to ventilate the roof, knowing that once he did, he would fall into the fire. Lawrence told Irwin to prepare to sound the 20 bells. Irwin pointed out that Pruitt was retired, but Lawrence countered that dying ventilating a roof sure sounds like firefighting. Irwin sounded the bells. ''(\"[[I'll Be Seeing You]]\")''\n\n===Pruitt's Funeral===\nLawrence attended Pruitt's funeral, which was streamed online due to safety regulations concerning the coronavirus pandemic. ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe was a firefighter with the Seattle Fire Department. He was the Captain of [[SFD Station 19]] when Pruitt joined the station as a rookie.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS193x12CaptainLawrence.png|[[I'll Be Seeing You]]\nS193x16CaptainLawrence.png|[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\nS194x01CaptainLawrence.png|[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Captain Lawrence Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lawrence, Captain}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Firefighters]]"}]}}}}
