In the hospital, he was still having night terrors and fought the doctors, even knocking [[Callie Torres]] to the ground.\n\nHe'd been having night terrors since his wife died. They said it was stress-related and gave him clonazepam. He figured he must have forgotten to take his pill that night because he hadn't had an episode in a while. However, Mark later spoke to his daughter, Ivy, who said they happened often. She usually got him back to bed and was able to get him back to sleep. That night, she'd fallen asleep and wasn't able to get him back to bed. She believed that because his night terrors were caused by stress, the least she could do was take care of him at night because he took such good care of her during the day.\n\nThey ordered an EEG for Arthur. They determined that his night terrors were due to a kind of epilepsy. Once it was confirmed, they took him into surgery to treat the epilepsy and repair the other damage from his fall.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married until his wife died.\n\n===Familial===\nAfter his wife's death, he raised his daughter, Ivy, on his own.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 45 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Soltanoff, Arthur}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}]}}}}
