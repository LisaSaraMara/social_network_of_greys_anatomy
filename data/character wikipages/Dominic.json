Sullivan overheard this call and convinced Dominic to call them back, saying he'd get in trouble for employing undocumented workers and also pointing out some fire violations in his kitchen. Dominic called them back, but two agents still came. They quickly ordered him out of the kitchen, saying they'd have to decide whether or not to charge him.\n\n==Career==\nHe owns and is the chef at Domenico's. \n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*His restaurant is located at 924 Sumpter Garden Square.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
