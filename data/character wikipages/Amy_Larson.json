Addison did an ultrasound and confirmed that Amy's baby didn't have DiGeorge, but she was horrified that Daniel had two wives.\n\nAddison brought the two women into the practice together and left them in a room together. They quickly figured out they were married to the same man. They were both angry, but Laura suggested that they work together, because they were both victims in the situation. When Amy went into labor, Laura held her hand while she gave birth. Laura also decided she wanted to keep the baby and Amy pledged to help her however she could. When Daniel returned after the baby was born, they asked him to leave.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe has been married to [[Daniel Larson]] for 12 years.
