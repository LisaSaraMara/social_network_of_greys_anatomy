He told her that he was experiencing premature ejaculation. She told him there were many possible causes and treatments. He said that's why he went online in the first place, then someone in a chat room told him about her. She reminded him that he'd said he'd seen her at a seminar. He said after the seminar, he went to a chat room and then said he wasn't supposed to mention the chat room, tipping her off that Cooper had sent Anthony her way.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe has a girlfriend.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker, Anthony}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Sexology)]]"}]}}}}
