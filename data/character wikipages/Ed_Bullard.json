Before her surgery, she signed a DNR, not wanting to live hooked up to a machine. They were able to remove the tumor, but the surgery was hard on her and her condition was critical afterward. When she coded, Ed started doing compressions, not wanting to lose her. Bailey eventually took over when he got tired, intending to stop and let her go. Derek had to step in and stop compressions.\n\nAt the end of the day, Ed left the hospital alone.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to [[Rosemary Bullard]] until her death. Before each of her surgeries, they said goodbye and then said hello again afterward. They appeared very in love and he tried to save her by giving her chest compressions, but was eventually tired and let go.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bullard, Ed}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]"}]}}}}
