They'd met two prior birth mothers, but both adoptions fell through. They were then matched with [[Judy]] and the doctors allowed them to talk and get to know each other. They also sat down with an adoption attorney and agreed to pay Judy's living expenses until the baby was born. ''(\"[[Know When to Fold]]\")''\n\n===Judy Giving Birth===\nJudy came back to the practice to delivery. During delivery, the baby got stuck by his shoulder. Addison pushed the baby back up and they took her to the the hospital for a c-section. She delivered the baby and noted that the baby had a diaphragmatic hernia. They asked her what she wanted to do, but she insisted that the Sinclairs make the decision because he was their baby. Addison explained the condition to the Sinclairs and gave them two options. They decided they couldn't make the decision and left. Violet came in to counsel Judy on the decision, who was worried she couldn't make the choice and then let go of him. The surgery was successful and afterward, Judy worried about him being all alone. Dell then took her to see him. The Sinclairs returned, saying that they wanted him still, but Judy said no, because they left when things were hard. She looked at the baby and said she was going to keep him.\n\nThe Sinclairs stopped by the practice to bring the things they'd bought for the baby, wanting him to have them even though they didn't have him. They explained that every time Carrie had a miscarriage or an adoption fell through, they felt like they'd lost a baby and didn't want to lose him. Naomi told Judy about the stuff they'd brought and said that she'd know what the right decision to make was. She ultimately decided to give the baby to the Sinclairs.
