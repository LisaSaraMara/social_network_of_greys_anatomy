He said the foot didn't belong to him. It felt like a corpse foot. He wanted a doctor to amputate his foot but because it was healthy, Bailey refused.\n\nShe had [[Raj Sen]] consult on the case. He said James had Body Dysmorphic Disorder and suggested that Bailey prescribe anti-anxiety meds. She tried, but James insisted that they wouldn't work.\n\nWhen another patient left a chainsaw unattended in the clinic, James used it to try to cut off his foot. Because his foot wasn't salvageable, Callie agreed to complete the amputation and he was taken into surgery.\n\n==Career==\nHe works at a bank.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miller, James}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}]}}}}
