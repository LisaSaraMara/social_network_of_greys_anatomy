[[Liz]], a co-worker, called for help, and firefighters started working to get oxygen into the room. When one of the workers indicated there was acid in the room, the firefighters had them lie down on the ground. Their efforts to breach the walls were fruitless until they were table to track down the engineer, [[Raphael]], and get him to the plant. Once the door was open, the workers were evacuated. Devin was given oxygen, but had a seizure from the exposure. They were able to stabilize him and got him to the aid car to take him to the hospital.\n\n==Career==\nHe works at Arkine Battery Recycling Plant.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Devin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
