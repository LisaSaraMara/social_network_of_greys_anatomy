They had a bone marrow donor lined up, but the donor died, so they decided to look up Hannah's birth mother, [[Izzie Stevens]], as a possible match. They approached her and asked if she'd donate despite being only a half-match. She agreed, but asked to see Hannah. Her parents went and asked her, but she said she was too tired.
