She told the doctors that she had had flu symptoms, so she took some antibiotics she had leftover, because she didn't have time to see a doctor due to having custody of her two nephews. The doctors ordered a CT, which showed toxic megacolon, which resulted from the antibiotics killing off the good bacteria. They took her to the OR, where she told them she didn't want to die because her nephews had already lost their mom. When she had sudden extreme pain in her abdomen from her colon rupturing, they quickly sedated her and Andrew operated to remove a portion of her colon. When she woke up, she was stable and talked to her nephews, saying she knew what happened was scary for them and giving them money to go get pizza to eat.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe got custody of her two nephews, [[Gabe]] and [[Eli]], when her sister died, two years ago. She says she loves them, but they take a lot of work. Before she got custody of the kids, her mother always told her she looked forward to the day Claire had kids so they could be as awful to her as she was to her mother.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conway, Claire}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}
