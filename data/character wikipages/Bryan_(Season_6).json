When he learned that college students qualified for utilities at a reduced price, he approached several of them and set up servers in their apartments, paying them a small amount of money in exchange for using their cheaper power to run the servers. He continued his until one of his operations caused a fire in an apartment complex. While the firefighters went around town looking for these operations to shut them down, a few of them also went to find Bryan. When he saw them, he insisted he wasn't doing anything illegal, but then jumped from a balcony, landing on the edge of his truck bed on his crotch, then falling to the ground. They started treating his groin injury as well as a likely concussion, then took him to the hospital for further treatment.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Bryan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
