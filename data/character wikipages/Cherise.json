This resulted in Kayla being actually cut nearly in half. She was rushed to the ER where her abdominal wounds were evaluated. She was taken directly from there into surgery.\n\nIn surgery, her kidney and part of her large intestine had to be removed. They reached a point where continuing to operate would kill her, so they packed her and took her to the ICU.\n\nWhile in the ICU, Kayla developed abdominal compartment syndrome and was taken back into surgery. They were able to relieve the pressure in her abdomen and bring her back to the ICU. They told Danny Wayne and Cherise that the next 24 hours would be critical.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nWhile they were both working as assistants to Kayla's husband, [[Danny Wayne]], Cherise and Kayla fell in love. Kayla stated she was dying in the marriage, but Cherise convinced her to stay until Danny got his dream of having a show in Las Vegas.\n\n==Career==\nShe is an assistant to [[Danny Wayne]], a magician.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}]}}}}
