Her husband offered to drive her, but she insisted on taking the bus. While she was waiting at the bus stop, someone attacked her simply because she's Asian-American. She was found and brought to the ER, where they examined her and began treating her injuries, which included facial trauma, abdominal trauma, and a broken humerus. She had a CT, which showed a splenic laceration, but it was minor, so Meredith decided to watch it to see if it would resolve itself while Nico and Lin operated on her arm and face. Her surgery went well and she was moved to the ICU afterward, but when her spleen ruptured, Meredith was forced to open her up in her room and stop the bleeding. After her second surgery, her family was told she'd be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Mr. Tom]].\n\n===Familial===\nMany members of her family came to the hospital when she was attacked. They have weekly family dinners together.\n\n==Career==\nShe was an engineer for the city's transportation department for thirty years before retiring.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 72 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n18x18-27.jpg\n18x18-32.jpg\n18x18-33.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tom, Alice}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}
