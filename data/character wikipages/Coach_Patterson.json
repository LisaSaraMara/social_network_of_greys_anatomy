Unbeknownst to him, Tyler's mother, [[Stacy Hatcher|Stacy]], forged the document so that Tyler could wrestle in the finals, which was his hope to get a college scholarship. Cooper and Sam tried to get him to stop the match when they arrived, but he said the medical release had been signed. They then watched as Tyler won his match and then went into cardiac arrest.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a high school wrestling coach.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPP4x17-3.jpg\nPP4x17-4.jpg\nPP4x17-6.jpg\nPP4x17-8.jpg\nPP4x17-9.jpg\nPP4x17-10.jpg\nPP4x17-14.jpg\nPP4x17-15.jpg\nPP4x17-16.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Patterson, Coach}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S4 Characters]]"}]}}}}
