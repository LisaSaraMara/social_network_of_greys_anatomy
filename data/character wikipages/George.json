As the last shuttle out was preparing to leave, George didn't want to go because he couldn't find his cat. Dean saw his distress and asked him about it. When he learned about the cat, Dean promised George he'd find his cat in order to get him to leave on the shuttle. Once he was gone, Dean kept his promise and looked for the cat, even though the other firefighters were convinced the cat had run into the woods and died. Dean ended up finding the cat in [[Terry]] and [[Maria|Maria's]] house. He brought the cat back to the command center and looked for George. Someone there told him that a man matching George's description had just died, upsetting Dean, but then George appeared and he and Rumplebum Tankers were reunited.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
