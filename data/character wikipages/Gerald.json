Because Gerald uses a walker, they were unable to evacuate themselves. When firefighters arrived, they assisted Gerald out of the building and pushed Ivy to walk herself out, stopping her from continuing to grab things, though she did bring out their wedding album. Once they were outside at triage, Ben and Travis gave them both oxygen masks and called for an aid car to take Gerald to the hospital. While they waited, Gerald went into cardiac arrest. They were able to restore sinus rhythm with CPR and then defibrillation. Ivy and Gerald were then put into an aid car so Gerald could be treated at the hospital. On the way, Ivy asked the firefighters about their lives and learned that Travis was running for mayor and that he was also single and gay. Ivy wrote down his name and then also wrote down her grandson's number for him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Ivy (Season 6)|Ivy]]. They have lived in the same apartment for 40 years.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have at least one child and at least one grandson, who is gay.\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
