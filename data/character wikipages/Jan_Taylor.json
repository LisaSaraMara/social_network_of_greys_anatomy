She wanted to donate his organs, but UNOS rejected them as he had a history of cancer. She then decided to donate his body to research. [[Nick Marsh]] use him as the recipient for a genetically modified pig kidney. After the transplant had happened, Jan came to the hospital, saying she'd just gotten off a plane, and asked to see Mason. Nick consoled her and said she could see him and say goodbye later, but if she did it right away, donating his body would be for nothing. Later, Jan was able to see Mason.
