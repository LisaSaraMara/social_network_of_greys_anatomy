Because she had type one diabetes, her recovery was going slowly. Her insulin levels hadn't stabilized.\n\nDesperate to find a way to help, Bailey suggested Clara being the first candidate in Richard's islet cell device trial. He agreed to apply for an emergency waiver from the FDA while Bailey presented the idea to the Greenes.\n\nWhen Clara went into a hypoglycemic coma, Richard decided not to wait on the waiver and operated immediately to place the device. Clara stabilized after the surgery and then the waiver came through.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Sean Greene]].\n\n===Familial===\nHer kids were living in Iowa with her husband's parents. Sean said that he barely survived that house and hated having to leave his kids there.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 42 at the time of her tumor resection.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greene, Clara}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}
