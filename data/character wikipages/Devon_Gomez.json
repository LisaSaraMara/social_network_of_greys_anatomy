Later, he returned to have the ileostomy reversed. Prior to his surgery, he met his surgeons and one of him recognized him as the voice of a podcast he enjoyed. Devon said he'd had to pause the podcast after he was diagnosed because he didn't have the energy to go for walks, which was the basis of his podcast. He hope after having his ileostomy reversed, he'd be able to start it up again. Schmitt asked his permission to listen to his podcast while he operated, which Devon granted. They took him into his surgery, but he started hemorrhaging partway through and they were unable to save him. ''([[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He had a podcast called \"On Foot with Devon,\" which he had to stop after his first surgery.\n*He was pronounced dead at 1:19.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Devon Gomez Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Devon Gomez]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gomez, Devon}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}
