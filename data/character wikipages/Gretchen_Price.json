The tumor was benign but preventing Lily from breathing. After Lily stopped breathing, Gretchen was told that in order to remove the tumor, which had been removed several times before, they'd have to remove Lily's trachea, which would leave her completely unable to breathe, meaning she'd die either way.\n\nHowever, [[Arizona Robbins]] remembered something she'd read about growing a trachea out of a person's own cells, so they placed a stent to help her breathe and then removed a rib to get cartilage, which they used to grow a trachea, first in a lab and then her abdomen.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nGretchen is raising her daughter, Lily, by herself. When Lily was hospitalized, she was only able to visit a few times a week because they lived so far away.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She and Lily live three hours away from the hospital.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Price, Gretchen}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]"}]}}}}
