Clark did an ultrasound and asked Ben some questions about his ejaculation. Clark took several images of the mass and said, combined with his labs, it appeared to be cancerous, so he proposed orchiectomy to remove the mass, along with the rest of his testicle, and analyze the tissue. Ben and Bailey were shocked that his plan was so radical, but he impressed upon them the importance of acting quickly, before any cancerous cells could spread throughout his body. ''(\"[[I Guess I'm Floating]]\")''\n\nClark later removed the testicle successfully. ''(\"[[Comfortably Numb]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe is a [[Urology|urologist]] working at his own private practice named Kabir Urology Clinic. He performs his surgeries at [[East Bay Surgical Center]], meaning he either splits his time between his clinic and the hospital or just holds surgical privileges at the latter.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nS194x13ClarkKabir.png|[[I Guess I'm Floating]]\nS194x14ClarkKabir.png|[[Comfortably Numb]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Clark Kabir Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kabir, Clark}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}
