She called for help and guided [[Maya Bishop|Maya]] and [[Theo Ruiz|Theo]] to Dirk so they could treat him. When two people nearby started fighting with staffs, she told them to stop. They ignored her and switched their staffs for torches. She told them they couldn't play with those, but before she could stop them, one of them sent a spark into the maze, igniting the corn. Cammy ran after them when they fled. She later told Beckett that there were 8-10 civilians left inside the maze and watched as they evacuated the last few.\n\n==Career==\nShe manages a Halloween carnival called Horror Hayground.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS196x04-2.jpg\nS196x04-18.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S6 Characters]]"}]}}}}
