When she started dialysis, he sat with her during her treatment and explained things to her when she struggled to understand the doctors. During this time, he also started using heroin, which led to him getting an infected abscess on his arm. Judy dragged him into the clinic, where she yelled at him about his heroin use while Ben started treating him. Ben was eventually able to get them both to stop yelling and talk. Ben told Aston that he needed to go to rehab and offered to refer him to a place. Aston tearfully accepted.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis mother has advanced kidney disease and goes to dialysis three days a week.\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
