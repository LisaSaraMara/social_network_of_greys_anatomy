He ended up in Iraq as a refugee, where he met [[Megan Hunt]], who raised him as her son for the next six years, though she was never able to adopt him legally. When she was evacuated to the US for medical treatment, he wasn't able to go with her because she couldn't get a visa for him. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n===Coming to Seattle===\nAfter seeing Megan's distress at not being able to be with Farouk, Nathan went to Iraq himself and had Farouk fake an illness so he could take Farouk to the US under the guise of participating in a medical trial. When he arrived, they tried to delay his entry while waiting on paperwork, but Meredith convinced them that his condition was critical enough not to wait, so he was taken to the hospital and happily reunited with his mom. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n===Moving to Los Angeles===\nAfter Megan was released from the hospital, she decided to move to the beach with Farouk and Nathan. She sent Nathan and Farouk ahead to set up the [[Megan and Nathan's House|house]]. While they worked, Farouk and Nathan bonded, agreeing that even though they didn't know what they were doing, they were prepared to muddle through together because they both love Megan. Megan later joined them and they went to the beach together and played happily. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n===Teddy and Owen's Wedding===\nMegan and Farouk came to Seattle for Teddy and Owen's wedding. The wedding was initially supposed to take place in a park, but before the priest could finish the ceremony, a couple on a tandem bicycle crashed into him, seriously injuring both him and the couple. After the priest died, Megan stepped in and performed the ceremony at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n===Illness and Recovery===\nFarouk came to the hospital with his mother, who was concerned because he'd been getting short of breath more easily and his ankles were swollen. After an exam and some tests, Cormac diagnosed him with constrictive pericarditis and said he'd probably need surgery to correct it. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Farouk's surgery, Farouk revealed that he'd looked into Winston's surgical reputation and learned good things. He was taken into surgery, which went smoothly. However, when they finished, they discovered his heart had swollen and wouldn't fit in his chest cavity. They injected epinephrine and waited for the swelling to go down. When it did, they were able to close and Farouk was taken to recovery. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nFarouk was still in the hospital on Thanksgiving. He played Monopoly with Megan, Teddy, and Cormac to pass some time. Later in the day, Farouk went into v-fib. Teddy ran the code for thirty minutes before Cormac said there was no saving his heart. He said they needed to put Farouk on ECMO, then they got him put on the transplant list for a new heart. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nWhen a heart became available in Tacoma, Teddy, Owen and Cormac went to retrieve it. While they were gone, Winston took Farouk into the OR so he would be ready when the heart arrived. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhen the heart arrived, Winston examined it and saw that it was bruised from the car accident that occurred on the way to the hospital. He consulted with Maggie, who recommended discarding it and waiting for the next heart. However, Winston decided to go forward with the transplant anyway, believing Farouk didn't have time to wait for another heart. They completed the transplant and the heart began beating strongly in Farouk's chest. They were able to close and move him back to his room. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nAfter his transplant, Farouk was recovering well and his body was tolerating the anti-rejection meds. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\nWhile recovering at Owen and Teddy's house, Farouk began to compete with Owen to recover. Finally, once he'd recovered enough, Farouk and Megan left to go back home. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhen his birth parents died, he was informally adopted by [[Megan Hunt]].
