Peter accidentally shot Brandon in the abdomen, seriously injuring him. He was taken to the ER, where he had no reflexes in his feet, indicating paralysis.\n\nThey took him into surgery, where the doctors worked to repair the damage. Amelia, wanting to avoid permanent paralysis, said she could either put Brandon in a brace or she could try to decompress his spine in surgery. She went to his mother, who agreed with her suggestion that they should try the spinal decompression. Amelia was able to decompress his spine, but before she finished, he went into ventricular tachycardia, forcing them to defibrillate, which moved his body and undid all her work.\n\nAfter his surgery, Brandon was alive, but his parents were told that while he could have physical and occupational therapy to regain some function, he'd never walk again.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nBrandon's mother owns a gun that she keeps locked in a drawer. Brandon and his friend were able to get the gun out of the drawer while she wasn't home.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe and [[Peter Green]] are friends. While they were playing together at Brandon's house, they found Brandon's mom's gun and Peter accidentally shot Brandon with it.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was eight at the time of the shooting.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cole, Brandon}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}
