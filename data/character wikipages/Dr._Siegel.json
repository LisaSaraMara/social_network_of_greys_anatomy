[[Ben Warren]] and [[Mitchell Spencer]] arrived to examine the patient. By that point, he didn't have a pulse, so they started CPR and started to look for tools to crack the patient's chest, but since they were in the psych ward, no items were available. Dr. Siegel argued with them, especially after learning that they weren't attendings. Ben, to Siegel's horror, broke off a piece of his clipboard and used it to open the patient's chest. Siegel later left an outraged message for [[Miranda Bailey]] which led to Ben being suspended.\n\n==Career==\nHe is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Siegel, Dr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}
