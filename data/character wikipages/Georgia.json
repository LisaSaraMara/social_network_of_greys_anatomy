She had many tiny shards in her skin, plus one large one in her abdomen. Link checked the nerve function in her hand, where she had a large cut, which came out fine. Her minor wounds were stitched and then she was taken to surgery to remove the large piece of glass and repair her abdomen.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}
