When station 19 came to search the building for [[Penelope Hayes]], who had gone missing, they came up Graham, who was confused. They thought maybe his apartment was filled with gas because he had left his gas stove on when the power went out, but Maya discovered that the apartment was filled with gas despite the stove not being the source. They then knew there was a gas leak in the building and took Graham down to the Aid Car for treatment while they evacuated the whole building.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
