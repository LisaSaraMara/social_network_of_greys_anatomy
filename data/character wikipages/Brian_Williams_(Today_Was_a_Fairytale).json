He went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma on his adrenal gland. Because he'd previously donated a kidney to [[Nick Marsh]], he had only one adrenal gland, making his surgery extremely risky. Despite this complication, his surgery went well and he was stable afterward and his kidney was undamaged.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to a woman named Paige.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have three daughters. One daughter is trying to get a volleyball scholarship, one is in callbacks for the school play, and one just got dumped. In addition to that, he helped raise Nick's niece, Charlotte.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe and [[Nick Marsh]] have been friends since they were five. They played Little League together and after Nick's mom died, he practically lived with Brian's family.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n18x07-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Brian Williams}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Brian}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}]}}}}
