In order to get him medications not covered by her insurance, his mother stole she money from her work. She was planning to pay it back, but she was caught before she could. She accepted her arrest, but on the day of sentencing, she fled in order to see her son. She hit herself on the head and feigned amnesia in order to get taken to the hospital. When she was taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], she quickly left and went to [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]], where her son was. She was able to convince the firefighters to stall so she could say goodbye to Jason, who was worried he'd die before seeing her again. Once he was taken to surgery, she allowed Ryan to arrest her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis mother stole money from her work in order to pay for his medical care. After she was arrested, his aunt began caring for him.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chen, Jason}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S2 Characters]]"}]}}}}
