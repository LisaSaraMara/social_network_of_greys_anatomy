He also asked her if she still had her wedding ring. When she said that she did, he told her to wear it, because jurors respond better to married women with families. He also advised her to drink the water in front of her sparingly.\n\n==Career==\nGreg is a lawyer. He represented [[Callie Torres]] when she was sued by [[Travis Reed]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x09-1.jpg\n10x09-2.jpg\n10x09-14.jpg\n10x09-15.jpg\n10x09-20.jpg\n10x09-21.jpg\n10x09-26.jpg\n10x09-30.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Greg}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}]}}}}
