She said she couldn't remember anything about the crash. She was worried about her husband, Larry, whom she said was in the laundromat. They ran some tests to figure out what might have caused her to drive into the laundromat with no memory of what happened. All her tests came back negative.\n\nAfter Larry got out of surgery, she admitted to [[April Kepner|April]] and [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] that he'd left her three months prior. A week later, he'd moved in with another woman, Kimmy, who sang in the choir at their church. She was driving to the post office when she saw his car outside the laundromat. She looked in and saw him folding Kimmy's panties. That angered her as he never did laundry for her when they were married, causing her to run her car into the laundromat on purpose. She mistakenly believed she could tell her doctors and they wouldn't be able to tell the police because of doctor-patient confidentiality. They informed her that she was mistaken, since that only applied to medical information,\u00a0and she had to talk to the police about what she had done.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to [[Larry Davis]] for 38 years when he left her.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Eleanor}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}
