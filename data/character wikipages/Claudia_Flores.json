On the first day, she went out with Ben to respond to a possible aircraft crash with injuries. They treated only minor injuries until [[Rigo Vasquez]] was thrown backward and eviscerated. They got him back to the rig and Claudia and Pruitt assisted Ben as he did REBOA to stabilize Rigo, then they drove him to the hospital. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\n===Truck Crash===\nClaudia and the PRT were called out again when they discovered that a vehicle accident was much worse than they anticipated. They tended to [[Steve Charnofsky]], who initially seemed to be stable. However, when they went to move him, they found him showing signs of brain death. They quickly moved him to the PRT, but it was too late and they decided to take him to the hospital for confirmatory tests. Claudia went looking for someone to call about him and they discovered he was an organ donor, so Ben left Claudia behind to help treat the remaining patients while Ben took him to the hospital for a possible organ recovery. Claudia then went to work on [[Nate (Born to Run)|Nate]], who unfortunately died at the scene. ''(\"[[Born to Run]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nShe is a certified registered nurse anesthetist recently hired to work with [[Ben Warren]] and [[Pruitt Herrera]] on the Physician Response Team rig.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She speaks both English and Spanish.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], 3x07 (S19)</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS193x07ClaudiaFlores.png|[[Satellite of Love]]\nS193x08ClaudiaFlores.png|[[Born to Run]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Claudia Flores Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flores, Claudia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Nurses]]"}]}}}}
