Her surgery was pro bono because her insurance had capped out.\n\nJackson explained the surgery to her, saying they would harvest skin from her back and scalp and her new scars would be hidden in her facial plains. He showed her the simulation of what her face would look like, which excited her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe and [[Carlos McAdams]] are married.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a kindergarten teacher.
