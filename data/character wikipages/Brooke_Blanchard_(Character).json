Jana had only a laceration that needed stitches, but Brooke was seriously burned.

While she was in surgery, Jana labored and delivered her baby.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe and Jana have a son and a daughter together.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe and Jana have been best friends since third grade.
