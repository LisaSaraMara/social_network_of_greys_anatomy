She was worried that something was wrong with him because his head was unusually large. Cooper said babies can be born with large heads, but they grow into them. He then looked at the baby and agreed to run some tests.\n\nThe tests all came back negative. Janet was still worried about her son being different. Cooper said that he might get picked on, but that wouldn't stop him from being great.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer son, Miles, has an unusually large head, which concerned her.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Janet}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S2 Characters]]"}]}}}}
