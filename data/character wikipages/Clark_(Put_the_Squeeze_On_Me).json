Then she wrapped her body around his and began constricting. Clark put him in the back of the car and drove him to the hospital. Once they arrived, several doctors came out to assess Ivan. Ivan kept insisting that it looked worse than it was and that Gigi hadn't meant any harm. When Animal Control was delayed, Winston had the idea to spray Gigi with alcohol, which would irritate her eyes and get her to release her jaw so they could free him. Bailey did that and then Winston, Jordan, and Link unwrapped Gigi from Ivan's body. Then they got him onto a gurney and took him inside.\n\nIn the ER, he had reduced oxygen and a chest x-ray showed opacity in his chest. Richard believed it was a hemothorax and wanted to insert a chest tube, but Bailey said no and insisted on a CT, which showed that Ivan actually had a diaphragmatic rupture and the opacity was his abdominal organs, which had been compressed into his chest cavity. They took him into surgery, where they moved his organs back into his abdomen. When he started coding and went into DIC, they were forced to stop the surgery, pack him, and move him to the ICU.\n\nOn the way to the ICU, he coded again, and Bailey did chest compressions until they got him into his room, where they defibrillated. They were able to stabilize him enough that Clark was able to sit with him. The hope was that they could continue his surgery the next day. While Ivan was in surgery, Clark made the decision to have Gigi sent to an animal rescue.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is dating [[Ivan]]. When Ivan was bitten by his pet python, Clark struggled with loving someone who had such a blindspot for the harm such a large animal could do.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Clark}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]"}]}}}}
