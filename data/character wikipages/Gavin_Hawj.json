When David Hamilton put extra pressure on them to work faster, he helped test various options. They were able to make some improvement, but not enough to meet the FDA's requirement for compassionate release. They continued to try different options to keep the cells cool enough until Amelia had the idea to cool the needle they were using to inject them. They ran several trials with the needles at different temperatures. One of the trials was successful at giving them a 92% viability.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a research assistant and tech genius at [[The Grey Center]]. He built the motorized injector they were using to inject the cells.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n18x07-1.jpg\n18x07-2.jpg\n18x07-3.jpg\n18x07-30.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:Gavin Hawj]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hawj, Gavin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}
