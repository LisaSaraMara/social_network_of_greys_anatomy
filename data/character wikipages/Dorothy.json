She'd been seeing Jake for fertility and he sent her to Addison. She'd been born without a uterus, but had functional ovaries. She wanted Addison to give her Dorthy's uterus.\n\nAfter speaking to Nina, Addison agreed to do the surgery. However, there was bleeding and in order to save Nina's life, they had to cut off blood supply to the graft.\n\nJake had to break the news to her that the transplant didn't take and told her there were other ways for her to become a mother.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhen her daughter was sick as a child, she cleaned her room and bought her flowers, something her daughter then did for her own daughter.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}]}}}}
