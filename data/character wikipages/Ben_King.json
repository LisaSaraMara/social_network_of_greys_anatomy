Pete used acupuncture to treat him, while Ben tried to set him up with his mother.\n\nBen came in to the practice with his mom. He'd called her from a friend's house saying he had trouble swallowing. By the time they arrived, he was having trouble breathing. Pete gave him a shot of adrenaline to help him breathe. Ben, Pete, and Lisa later spent time together happily. ''(\"[[Do the Right Thing]]\")''\n\nPete told Lisa that Ben seemed to have no residual damage from his asthma attacks. ''(\"[[What You Do for Love]]\")''\n\nWhen Pete ended things with Lisa, Pete wanted to keep Ben as a patient because he didn't want the breakup to affect him. Lisa decided otherwise.
