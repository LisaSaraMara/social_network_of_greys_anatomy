She'd had two prior open-heart surgeries and made a trip with her family from Boston to Seattle for a third. Her condition made it unsafe for her to fly on a commercial airplane, so her parents used a crowdfunding website to raise money, which they used to get an RV and drive across the country. On the way, they stopped at several tourist attractions. By the time they reached Seattle, Fernanda was starting to feel dizzy, so they rushed her directly to the PICU. She was dehydrated, so they gave her fluids and ordered more tests, which showed that her aortic stenosis had gotten worse and they were forced to covert to a Ross-Konno Procedure. It carried additional risk, but her parents agreed to it because Maggie said it was the best option. The surgery went well and her family was told she'd be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Daniel Lima]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband have two children: [[Rafael Lima|Rafael]] and [[Fernanda Lima|Fernanda]].
