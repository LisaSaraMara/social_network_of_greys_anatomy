Casey said she didn't think she should worry about good grades or college when all she wanted was to be a mom, Jamie said it was instant status, and Lisa said babies love you no matter what. There's a lot going on at her house, so her mother can't give them all attention all the time.\n\nRicky came in late to their joint session. She'd told Jamie she needed to pick up her brother, but she came back with Violet's book, saying Violet wasn't the right therapist for their daughters. She took Jamie and left.\n\nSheldon and Violet took Casey and Lisa to tour the hospital. Casey and Lisa by that point had read Violet's book and made several comments about it. Violet started to fight back, but Casey started having serious abdominal pain and bleeding. She was rushed in for an emergency c-section. Lisa watched as Casey's baby was delivered and said it wasn't what she expected and left.\n\nJamie later called Casey and said she was giving her baby up for adoption.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother was upset that she'd made a pact with her friends to get pregnant. When she figured out where she recognized Violet from, she refused to let Jamie see her anymore.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe and her friends [[Casey]] and [[Lisa (The Hardest Part)|Lisa]], made a pact to get pregnant together in high school. However, Lisa and Jamie both backed out of their plan when Casey's baby was born after an emergency.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPP4x18-4.png\nPP4x18-16.jpg\nPP4x18-30.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}]}}}}
