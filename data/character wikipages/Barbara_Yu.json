Since they had no other options, the people in the church tried to evacuate in a bus. However, the bus crashed outside the hospital and a fuel leak caused a fire, so they had to be evacuated quickly out of the bus.\n\nBarbara was stuck between two seats. Owen and Jackson boarded the bus to try to get her out, but she was concerned about her daughter, Evie, who is three. They were able to wrap up her arm, which was injured, and move one of the seats to free her. After she was pulled out, Jackson noticed a pink high-top sneaker like Barbara had described her daughter wearing. He looked back inside and saw Evie hiding. He tried to entice her to come out on her own, but eventually, he had to go in after her. Soon after that, the bus exploded, but Jackson emerged from the wreckage carrying Evie.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe has a daughter, Evie, who was with her in the bus crash.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yu, Barbara}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}
