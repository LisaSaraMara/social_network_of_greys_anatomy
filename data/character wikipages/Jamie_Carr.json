She declined pain medication because she was eight months pregnant. She was concerned because he'd been kicking before she fell and had stopped. [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] did an ultrasound and discovered that there had been a fetal demise. The x-ray of her wrist showed that the bones were out of alignment, so Jamie needed to be put in traction to re-align the bones before her wrist could be casted. Jamie and her husband were devastated to hear that their baby had died.\n\nJamie then delivered the baby and held him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Ted Carr]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe was eight months pregnant when she fell in the shower.
