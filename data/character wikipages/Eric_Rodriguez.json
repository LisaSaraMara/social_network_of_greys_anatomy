He wanted to use chemo, while Addison believed surgery was a better option. Ultimately, the parents chose surgery and Kyla's tumor was completely removed. ''(\"[[In or Out]]\")''\n\n===Susan Grant's Cancer===\nAddison asked Eric for a consult when her mother asked her to cure her lover, Susan, who was suffering from ovarian cancer.\u00a0He initially shared her professional opinion that it wasn't treatable, but when Bizzy pushed, Addison figured out she could operated with the [[Da Vinci Surgical System]] and asked Eric to join her and use hot chemo to kill the cells she left behind. He agreed and they were able to remove all the cancer and place a port for chemo. ''(\"[[If You Don't Know Me By Now]]\")''\n\nWhen Addison confronted him about Susan being sick, he admitted that he knew her cancer was back, but wanted to give Susan and Bizzy the wedding day they wanted. ''(\"[[Heaven Can Wait]]\")''\n\nWhen Susan was brought back to the hospital after the wedding, they were able to stabilize her, but she was in septic shock because the chemo had made her vulnerable to infection. She ultimately died when she threw a clot in her lung. ''(\"[[Blind Love]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]====\nEric had a crush on Addison and flirted openly with her, despite her objections. After they worked on Kyla Woods together, he asked her on a date. She declined because she was seeing Sam. ''(\"[[In or Out]]\")''\n\nWhen Addison paged him to help her with [[Susan Grant]], he said he thought she'd changed her mind about going out with him, but she said she hadn't. ''(\"[[If You Don't Know Me By Now]]\")''\n\nHe continued to flirt with Addison, even though she repeatedly told him she was in love with Sam. ''(\"[[Heaven Can Wait]]\")''\n\n===Familial===\nHe's from a prominent family in South America.
