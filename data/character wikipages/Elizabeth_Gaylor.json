One day, a smoke smell overwhelmed the building, leading to one of their neighbors calling the fire department. Rainbow Trout let the firefighters into the building, where they cut the power so they could find the source of the smell before it started a fire. The firefighters ended up tracing the smell to a room in the queens' apartment. The firefighters started an evacuation, warning them that there was about to be a fire in their apartment. Ruby got out, but Izzy, Elizabeth, and Rainbow went back in for their valuables, delaying their exit. On their way out, Rainbow fell and hurt her ankle. She couldn't walk, so Izzy picked her up and carried her downstairs and out of the building. Elizabeth, meanwhile, had stopped to take a xanax and ignored firefighter instructions to go back inside after Big Red, Izzy's beloved wig. She opened a door, which caused a smoke explosion, throwing all three of them back.\n\nWhen Jack woke, he picked up Elizabeth and carried her outside, where her sisters swarmed her. She was given oxygen and taken to the hospital. Izzy rode with her in the aid car and explained to Travis that the wig had come from her meemaw, who had accepted her when she came out. Despite that, she'd let that wig burn up a million times to make sure her sisters were safe, as they'd been the ones to pick her up when her meemaw died.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nElizabeth Gaylor lives in an apartment with friends and fellow drag queens [[Izzy Packing]], [[Rainbow Trout]], and [[Ruby Red Slippers]]. Despite being good friends, they all felt the pressure of being confined together during the pandemic.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a prominent drag queen in Seattle. With the COVID-19 pandemic, she and her fellow queens were forced to start streaming their performances on the internet. Together, they call themselves the Queen Anne Queens.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her name is an obvious reference to Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS194x03-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gaylor, Elizabeth}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
