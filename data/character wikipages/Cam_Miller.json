He was brought in stable with a GCS of 14. He was covered in gasoline from the tanker leak. Despite this, he wanted to go outside to get a cigarette. Since his injuries were minor, he was quickly treated and released. However, he was re-admitted when he smoked just outside the hospital, causing him to burst into flames. He also managed to snap his elbow. He was taken into surgery directly from the ER.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n9x19-20.jpg\n9x19-21.jpg\n9x19-22.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miller, Cam}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}
