He was putting in insulation as a cost-cutting effort. He also told Brenda he would fix the roof rather than pay someone else to do it. After Emmett's two surgeries, Brenda asked if she could spend the night in the hospital with him because she'd gone home the first night and been unable to sleep.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe's been married to [[Emmett Lawson]] for twenty years.
