Before her surgery, she said she'd called her neighbor to make sure her house still had heat, because she was worried about her cats. Once she found out they were okay, she then worried about the stray cats. Taryn tried to help, saying that freezing to death is supposed to be a peaceful way to go, but that didn't reassure her. Then [[Tess Anderson|Tess]] said the shelters were open 24 hours a day and they were taking in any animals people brought in and they had plenty of food. After her surgery, Ava asked for the doctor who had said the nice things about the animals, not knowing Tess wasn't actually a doctor.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She has cats and was concerned for their welfare.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gutierrez, Ava}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}
