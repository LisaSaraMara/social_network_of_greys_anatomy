While experiencing the effects of LSD, they believed a bat was after them. They jumped off the roof, aiming to land in the pool. River did so, but Jarah hit the ground instead. Both teens were transported the hospital, where Jarah had a flail chest, which required a chest tube. His arm was also broken. His chest tube put out a lot of blood, so Maggie took him into surgery. In surgery, his pulmonary artery was lacerated, causing catastrophic bleeding, but Maggie was able to stop it and his father was told he would be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis father was worried about him when he was injured.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe and [[River Epley]] are friends and lab partners.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He plays soccer.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Al-Hasan, Jarah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}
