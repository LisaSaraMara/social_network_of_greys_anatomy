Lizzie later gave birth to a baby she named Natasha. When Lizzie nearly smothered Natasha while breastfeeding, Amelia called in Janet. Janet came up from San Diego to take Natasha home with her. Janet agreed to wait until they operated to try to restore Lizzie's vision, but said if they weren't able to, she'd be taking Natasha back with her.\n\nLizzie had the surgery and as her bandages were removed, she talked about seeing things around the room. Janet left, upset. She said that things were supposed to go so differently. Eric was supposed to be alive and she was supposed to gain a daughter and she was supposed to be there for her grandchildren.\n\nShe returned to Lizzie's room to say goodbye to Natasha before leaving to go home, but was told that Lizzie had lied and was totally blind after her surgery. Janet said she'd stay to help out, just as long as Lizzie needed to get adjusted to taking care of her. They agreed to try that.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer son, Eric, died in Afghanistan several months before his daughter, Natasha was born.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Janet}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S4 Characters]]"}]}}}}
