He was diagnosed with a brain tumor which had spread to his spine, causing motor weakness in his limbs and sensory deficits. His mom, desperate to save him, took him to Grey Sloan Memorial to see her ex-husband, Tom, a neurosurgeon. Before they met, she warned Guthrie that since he looked like his deceased brother, it might freak Tom out to meet him. Due to the resemblance and the relationship to Guthrie's mother, Tom said he couldn't do the surgery. However, when Amelia started having contractions during the surgery and believed she was in labor, Tom was forced to step in and take over. Despite a hiccup, he was able to finish the surgery and Dana and Ed were told he'd be okay with some radiation.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Dana Hamilton]].\n\n===Familial===\nHis son, Guthrie, had a brain tumor that spread to his spine when he was ten years old.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hamilton, Ed}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}]}}}}
