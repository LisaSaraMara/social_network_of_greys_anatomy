Fowler disliked this work, treating the convicts as lesser humans. He also knew of Sullivan's history and disparaged him for that as well.\n\nWhile they were training the convict crew, they got a call related to a fire at a rest stop and left to take the call. They passed the fire and ended up at a very nice house, where they simply waited to protect the house in case the fire approached. As he heard that the fire was getting worse, Sullivan jumped in the truck and took it back to the fire, leaving Fowler on his own. When he came back, Sullivan expressed his disappointment in the system they were working for and said he was fine being fired.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a private firefighter for Mavis Private Client Fire Protection.\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Firefighters]]"}]}}}}
