When that was cancelled due to the extreme heat making the fire engine too hot to touch, Ari approached Sullivan and told him she could help him navigate his newfound fame and criticism that came from the \"Fire Zaddy\" video. She said she could get him essentially anything he wanted because of that video. He said he wanted to be promoted back up and wanted full support for Crisis One. She said that was doable. ''(\"[[Too Darn Hot]]\")''\n\n===Sullivan's Profile===\nAri put together an ad campaign with Sullivan at the center. When he expressed concern about how he was portrayed, she assured him it would be good for the station and also good for him. It would put him in the fast lane to be battalion chief again.
