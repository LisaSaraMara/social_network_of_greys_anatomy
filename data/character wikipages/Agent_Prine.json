Shortly after they arrived, Sullivan came into the kitchen and said because there'd been a grease fire in the kitchen, it was his scene and said that all the kitchen employees, particularly Beto, who pretended to have a serious burn on his arm, were his patients. He then calmly explained out loud that the law prohibited them from asking for documentation without just cause and also prohibited them from chasing anyone who decided to run from the scene, prompting the rest of the kitchen staff to run out quickly. Prine tried to chase them, but Sullivan stopped them, claiming he just slipped on the floor.\n\nThey convinced Prine and Baxter to let them wait for an ambulance to avoid the bad PR that could come from denying him medical care. When the PRT arrived, Prine wanted to ride with them, but Jackson said Beto wouldn't talk to them without a lawyer present, so there was no point. Prine and Baxter were instead told they could meet him at the hospital. On their way to the hospital, Jackson and Ben decided to create an opening for Beto to escape.\n\n==Career==\nHe is an agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS193x11-20.jpg\nS193x11-21.jpg\nS193x11-22.jpg\nS193x11-23.jpg\nS193x11-24.jpg\nS193x11-25.jpg\nS193x11-27.jpg\nS193x11-28.jpg\nS193x11-30.jpg\nS193x11-31.jpg\nS193x11-32.jpg\nS193x11-33.jpg\nS193x11-34.jpg\nS193x11-35.jpg\nS193x11-36.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prine, Agent}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]"}]}}}}
