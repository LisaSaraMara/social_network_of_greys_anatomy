Andy realized after a conversation with Jack that she was likely not the first or only person he had raped or attempted to rape. She started looking for potential candidates and eventually found one, though her comment was anonymous. She went to Pope with this information, he said he needed an actual witness, though he admitted that he'd had other unsubstantiated reports about Jeremy. Andy was able to track down [[Holly (Crawl Out Through the Fallout)|Holly]], whom Jeremy had raped in college. Once he heard Holly's story, Pope dropped the charges against Andy.\n\n==Career==\nHe is the prosecutor for King County.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pope, James}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S5 Characters]]"}]}}}}
