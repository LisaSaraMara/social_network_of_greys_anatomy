He was severely jaundiced and unable to leave his hospital bed. After 137 days on the transplant list, Nick came to check on him and invited him to a basketball game. His mother was upset, because she said the hope made things harder. Then Nick revealed that a liver had become available and was going to Arthur. Once the liver was retrieved, Nick transplanted it into Arthur. After the surgery was over, Nick told his mother that he would be walking around in a few weeks.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He reads SLAM magazine and is a fan of the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kyat, Arthur}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}]}}}}
