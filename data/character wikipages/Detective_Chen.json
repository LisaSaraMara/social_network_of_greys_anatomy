Andy spoke to them, telling them that she had hit Jeremy because he assaulted her first. Then she ran to the station, where she sent Maya, Vic, and Sullivan to treat Jeremy. Their questioning became more aggressive to the point where Andy said any additional questions could be directed at her lawyer. They told Beckett they needed to interview Maya, Vic, and Sullivan, but Beckett told them if they wanted to interview any members of his team, they needed to put a former request in through the department and until then, they needed to leave his station.\n\nThe next morning, Chen and Berarducci returned to the station and arrested Andy.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a homicide detective for the Seattle Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS195x15-9.jpg\nS195x15-12.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chen, Detective}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Police Officers]]"}]}}}}
