She pleaded with him to give her just a quick session and he agreed. After their session, Pete told her that he loved seeing her, but they couldn't keep doing it. She pushed him for just one more thing.\n\nBeverly kept coming back and trying to get him to treat her, but he told her directly that she has stage II lymphoma and she needed to see the oncologist he recommended because he was one of her favorite patients and he wanted her to live. She said she went to the waiting room, but seeing the other patients scared her away. He told her that they look like that because they're fighting and she needs to fight, too.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (CAM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}]}}}}
