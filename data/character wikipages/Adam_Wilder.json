He told Violet that their mother was very sick and the prison wasn't giving her the level of care she needed. Adam wanted Pete to push for Frances to get a humanitarian release.\n\nPete went to see Frances in prison and looked at her medical history. Adam said that 35 years in prison had changed her and begged Pete to help.\n\nPete took her medical records to Sam and pressed him to diagnose a condition that required a defibrillator, which couldn't be monitored in prison, meaning they'd probably release her. Sam gave him his letterhead and said he'd sign anything Pete wrote. Pete, however, was unable to go through with it, upsetting Adam. Pete then said it wasn't too late for the two of them to repair their relationship. ''(\"[[Can't Find My Way Back Home]]\")''\n\n===Frances's Death===\nAdam came into the ER with Frances, who was having arrhythmias. He later confessed to bribing a guard to give her digoxin to get her out of prison. When he found out that Frances's heart was damaged by the digoxin, he blamed himself for her impending death. Pete said that Frances had been sick for a long time and it wasn't his fault. They both sat by her beside as she died. ''(\"[[The Hardest Part]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe stood by his mother and had an estranged relationship with Pete. After Pete refused to lie to get Frances a compassionate release, he told Adam it wasn't too late for them.
