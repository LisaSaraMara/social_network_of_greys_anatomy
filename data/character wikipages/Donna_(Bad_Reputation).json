Through Angels of Humanity, he was bought to Seattle for surgery to remove the tumor, where Donna and [[Bob]] took care of him. When the scandal involving Harper Avery broke, Donna and Bob said Angels of Humanity pulled their funding because they didn't want to be associated with the name. However, the surgery went on after Meredith offered for them to do it pro bono.\n\n==Career==\nShe works for Angels of Humanity, an organization which brings kids to the United States for medical procedures.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Donna}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]"}]}}}}
