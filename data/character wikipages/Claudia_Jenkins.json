After following [[Wyatt Lockhart|Wyatt Lockhart's]] aggressive protocol of chemotherapy and radiation, she was in full remission. Wyatt called in [[Naomi Bennett]] because Claudia wanted a baby. After speaking with Claudia, who hadn't believed she'd beat the cancer initially, Naomi agreed to help her get pregnant. ''(\"[[Worlds Apart]]\")''\n\nNaomi implanted ovarian tissue into Claudia's abdomen, but it didn't take. However, they still had the other half of the ovarian tissue. Naomi said they could implant it deeper, which would give her a better chance. In order to get that accomplished, they called in [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] to do the surgery. She agreed.\n\nIn surgery, Addison saw the the tissue was extremely friable and determined that the risk of implanting ovarian tissue in the area was too risky. She decided to close and had to tell Claudia that the surgery wasn't successful.
