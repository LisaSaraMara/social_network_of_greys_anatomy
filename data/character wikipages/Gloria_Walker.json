Sam arrived and found Dave on the kitchen floor. Gloria seemed dazed and wouldn't let Sam in, so he broke a window. By that point, Gloria's grandson, Stevie, was with his father, who was unresponsive. Sam called an ambulance and had the paramedics take Stevie and Gloria along with Dave to the hospital, worried about leaving Gloria in charge of Stevie. In the ER, Dave was quickly discharged at his own request. Later, Stevie came to the practice with the same symptoms of his father. Suspicious, Sam ran tests and found coprine in Stevie's blood, a natural antabuse from ink cap mushrooms. He deduced that Gloria had been feeding them to Dave to get him to stop drinking, because drinking made him violently ill after consuming the mushrooms. Sam spoke to Gloria privately, trying to convince her to stop, but she was unwilling to do so because she knew she didn't have much time left to live and didn't want her son to keep drinking, as she knew he would end up dead. Sam called Stevie and Dave into his office and lied to them, saying that Dave was allergic to alcohol and that it could be genetic, so Stevie also shouldn't drink to be safe.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer family means everything to her. She lives with her son, Dave, and her grandson, Stevie. When she saw that Dave's drinking had gotten out of control, she fed him ink cap mushrooms, which she knew would make him seriously ill if he drank alcohol.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walker, Gloria}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S1 Characters]]"}]}}}}
