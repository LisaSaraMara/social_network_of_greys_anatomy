Alex was examining him while [[Morgan Peterson|Morgan]] quizzed him for his boards. Arizona came in and Alex told her that Chuck's abdominal pain had decreased to the point where it was time to schedule his gastroscopy. Arizona told Morgan that she was in luck, because Alex was a great person to have observing her first gastroscopy.\n\nHowever, contrary to Arizona's order, Alex did the gastroscopy himself so that Morgan could continue to quiz him for his boards.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}]}}}}
