He'd receive treatment to try to build up his immunity, which was supplemented with alternative methods because he wanted to go to the homecoming dance with his girlfriend. His blood count came back high enough, but because his mother had a fever, they said that he'd been compromised and couldn't go. She later called the doctors and said that Ryan was missing and so was his suit. They found him at the dance and when he collapsed, they took him from there to the hospital, where he was stabilized and taken into isolation.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe is very protective of her son because of his SCID.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crawford, Betty}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S3 Characters]]"}]}}}}
