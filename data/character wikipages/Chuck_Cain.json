He was discovered to have a narrowed aortic valve. [[Alex Karev|Alex]] planned to do open-heart surgery to replace Chuck's valve. However, Chuck didn't want to be left with a scar on his chest, as he says that women see a scar on your chest and all they see is a lifetime of hospitals and bad sex. He proposed an alternate surgery, a TAVI, which would only leave a small scar in his groin area, a surgery his friend had had. Alex did the research, but ultimately refused to do a TAVI, leaving Teddy to operate on Chuck instead.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nChuck is very flirty. When he had his surgery, he was concerned with having a scar and that turning off the ladies, so he proposed an alternate surgery that would not leave a scar on his chest.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe has a friend named Tony who had had the same heart problem Chuck had and had a TAVI to fix it.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 71 at the time of his heart surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cain, Chuck}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}]}}}}
