Before surgery, she had her doctors swear on \"The book,\" a copy of ''The Odyssey,'' that they would do their best work. They took her in for what should have been a straight-forward tumor resection, but when they got in there, they realized the tumor had grown quickly, wrapping around her heart and making their scans useless. They did a temporary abdominal closure and got new scans so they could develop a new surgical plan. When they saw that scans weren't enough, they printed a 3D rendering of the tumor to help them visualize the anatomy. With that, they began to develop a new surgical plan. However, while they were developing their new plan, Adrian started bleeding, so she had to be taken back into surgery immediately. They followed the plan they had developed up to the point where they hadn't planned anymore and then they had to make up a plan as they operated. They did so successfully and removed the whole tumor.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nAdrian is married to [[Michael Nelson]]. They met when Adrian came into the shop where Michael sells rare books and bought a copy of ''The Odyssey''. They were both interested in each other, but too shy to ask the other out, so Michael wrote his number on a bookmark, where Adrian found it when she got home. She called right away and they've been together ever since.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 51 at the time of her tumor resection.\n*She and Michael consider the copy of ''The Odyssey'' she bought from him to be like their wedding rings.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nelson, Adrian}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}]}}}}
