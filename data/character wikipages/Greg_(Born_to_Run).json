After they were both high, Greg started to have chest pains and fell off the houseboat into the water. Dean quickly pulled him out and started CPR, which he'd learned in high school when he was a lifeguard. He also told Tom to call 911, despite the presence of drugs on the scene. Pruitt and his partner then arrived and tried to take over, but Dean refused to stop doing compressions until Greg coughed up the water and started breathing again. He then allowed Pruitt to take over and Greg was taken away on a gurney.\n\n==Career==\nHe and [[Tom]] both work for Dean's father's company.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Saving Greg's life is what led to Dean becoming a firefighter.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Greg}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
