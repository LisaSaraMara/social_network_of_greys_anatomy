After tests and a cardio consult, Gus was diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Nathan wanted to put Gus on the transplant list, but Alex wanted to try a Norwood. Because they disagreed, they talked to Gus's parents about both options. However, Nathan secretly put Gus on the transplant list before they had decided. When a heart became available before they had decided, Nathan told the parents and they consented to the heart transplant. After his surgery, Gus was stable.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*His mom liked the name August and his dad liked Leo. They flipped a coin to decide his name.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Endris, August}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}]}}}}
