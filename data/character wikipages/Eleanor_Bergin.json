Addison looked at her scans and recommended fetal surgery. Because of her advanced age, she'd used an egg donor and IVF to get pregnant. Her age made the surgery more dangerous, but it was the best viable option.\n\nThe baby's heart rate started to slow down because of the buildup. Addison said the baby wasn't going to make it to viability and they either needed to terminate or do the surgery. Eleanor chose to have the surgery.\n\nHer husband was worried about her health and begged her to reconsider. She told him that they're never going to have the time other couples have together, but after she was gone, he'd have their baby to remember what they were together. After hearing that, he agreed to the surgery.\n\nAddison operated and was successful, but her stitches didn't hold, so she had to have a second surgery. The second surgery went well.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Ronald Bergin]]. He is 30 years younger than she is.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 60 at the time of her pregnancy.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPP3x09-7.jpg\nPP3x09-11.jpg\nPP3x09-20.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bergin, Eleanor}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]"}]}}}}
