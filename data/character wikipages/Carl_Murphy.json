He'd had reconstructive surgery for his ear, nose, and left index finger. He had slow capillary refill, so they used leeches to help his blood flow.\n\nWhile trying to attach the leeches, [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]] was nervous, so the leeches wouldn't attach. George took over and go them to bite and start working. The leeches did their job and Carl was on his way to recovery.
