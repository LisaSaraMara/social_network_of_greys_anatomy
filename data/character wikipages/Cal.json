One day, for their parents' anniversary, the kids decided they wanted to make a cake, but they didn't know how to work the oven. Their dad, Marco, found them and lost his temper when he saw Lila with her head in the oven. After he calmed down, he apologized and said parents lose their tempers sometimes, but that didn't mean they'd send the kids away, as Jack suspected might happen. Marco then told them the oven was faulty and they'd buy a cake instead. Then he helped them clean up the kitchen.\n\nLater that night, Jack woke up and saw a fire in the house. He woke up Lila and covered her with a blanket to get her out of the house. Once he got her outside, he ran back inside to find Cal and their parents. He found Cal and carried him outside. When he tried to go back in for their parents, Lila stopped him. Soon afterward, the windows of the house blew out. Shortly afterward, the kids were told that Marco and Samantha had died and each of them was taken by a different social worker.

''(\"[[Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe lived with [[Marco]] and Samantha, plus [[Lila (House Where Nobody Lives)|Lila]] and [[Jack Gibson]] until Marco and Samantha died in a house fire.
