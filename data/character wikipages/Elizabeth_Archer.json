She'd been admitted overnight for observation and then they scheduled surgery. However, the morning before her surgery, she wasn't in her room. They found her in another patient's room. She claimed she was healing the other patient. She stabilized the patient's heart rhythm and then collapsed.\n\nShe was told she needed surgery urgently. Before she would have the surgery, she asked them to talk her through the procedure so she could visualize the healing. Alex tried, but they said his energy was too dark, so he brought [[Izzie Stevens]] in to talk her through the procedure.\n\nAfter [[William George Bailey Jones|Tuck]] was injured in an accident, Bailey, desperate to help her son, had Elizabeth come to see him. She had his parents hold hands and did a healing ritual on him. Later, he started breathing on his own and was able to be extubated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\n[[Mai]] is part of Elizabeth's healing team.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 49 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Archer, Elizabeth}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}]}}}}
