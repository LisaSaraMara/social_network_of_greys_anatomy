When Connie found out that she needed more extensive surgery that would likely leave her unable to speak understandably, she was devastated. Then [[Mark Sloan]] and [[Richard Webber]] came up with a way for her to have surgery and keep her ability to speak. Despite this, she was worried, so Elaine and Joanne encouraged her to tell them everything she wanted to say before the surgery. She did, but the things she said hurt their feelings and she was worried she'd alienated them. However, after her surgery, Elaine and Joanne came into her room with gifts and had a few confessions of their own to share.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nShe, [[Joanne]], and [[Connie Williams]] are best friends. They all love to talk.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She has bad breath, despite having good hygiene.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]"}]}}}}
