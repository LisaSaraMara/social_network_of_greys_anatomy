He had surgery about it and afterward, was in serious abdominal pain. [[Meredith Grey]] called [[Robert Stark]]. He came, examined Drew, and then said it was just gas. He left her and went back to his night. They gave him an antiflatulent, but his pain was getting worse, so they ran some tests to figure out what was wrong.\n\nA CT revealed a perforated ulcer, but Stark didn't respond to his pages, so Drew needed surgery. They called Stark, but he didn't answer his pages, so they took him into surgery without an attending. His surgery went well.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nDrew's mother is very protective of him and demanded that the doctors take her concerns seriously when he had post-op pain.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McNeil, Drew}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}]}}}}
