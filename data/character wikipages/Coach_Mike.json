He knew Pete because Pete had previously worked on his back. Pete ran some tests and diagnosed bronchospasm. He said she'd need inhaled steroids and nebulizers to treat it and would have to stop running for a while until she recovered. Pete was shocked when he went to Nicole's next meet and found her running without difficulty breathing. However, at the end of her race, she collapsed and was rushed to the hospital, where she was found to be alkaloid toxic. Nicole confessed she'd gotten the drugs from Mike, which led Pete to punch Mike.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married.\n\n===Professional===\nHe and his wife basically raised [[Nicole Clemons]] because her family wasn't in the picture.\n\n==Career==\nMike is a running coach.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPP1x05-4.jpg\nPP1x05-12.jpg\nPP1x05-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mike}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S1 Characters]]"}]}}}}
