Violet came in for an interview that went well, but when asked why she was leaving her current practice, she couldn't stop looking at Ellen's belly.\n\nThis led to them talking about Violet's attack and Lucas's birth. Ellen forced her to talk about the difficult parts, including that she instructed Katie on how and where to cut. Ellen got her to realize that in doing that, she was putting Lucas ahead of herself, something she did again when she gave him to Pete.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a psychiatrist in a private office in New York.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sicher, Ellen}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}
