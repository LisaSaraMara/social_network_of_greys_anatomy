The baby had an acardiac twin endangering her life by overworking her heart. [[Arizona Robbins]] did a surgical procedure to separate Hannah from the mass in order to save her life. During the procedure, Kristen became distressed and that caused her water to break and labor to start. Hannah was born a short time later. Kristen initially didn't want to hold her, but decided to when she heard her cry. Kristen told her to be good and then had Arizona take her. The plan was for her to be adopted by Kristen's mother.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe was adopted by her biological grandmother because her mother was in prison for 20 years to life.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was born at 31 weeks gestation.\n*Kristen wanted to name her Ellie, but Emily decided to name her Hannah instead.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rochester, Hannah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neonatal)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]"}]}}}}
