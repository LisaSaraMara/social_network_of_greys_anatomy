They were both taken to the emergency room, where Danny got stitches for a facial laceration. He had a head CT and it was clear, so Cormac discharged him and he left with his father. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nDanny returned to the hospital when his dad collapsed at work. At his father's request, Owen took Danny and played video games with him to distract him from what was going on. While they were together, Danny asked Owen if his dad was doing to die, as he had noticed that his father had trouble breathing and was a lot weaker than he used to be. At the end of the day, the family left the hospital together.
