She was upset because she believed she was at fault because she was usually able to get him back to sleep, but she'd fallen asleep herself. When they found out that the night terrors were caused by epilepsy and not by stress, like they believed, Ivy was relieved. After talking to Mark, she was able to relax and fall asleep while her father was in surgery. He then put her to bed in a patient room.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe was being raised by her single father after the death of her mother. When the doctors said his night terrors were caused by stress, she stayed up all night to take care of him because she's his stress.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 13 at the time of her father's hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Soltanoff, Ivy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]"}]}}}}
