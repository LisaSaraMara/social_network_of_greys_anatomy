They examined the family and ran some labs. Gracie's tests came back and revealed that she had burkholderia cepacia, an aggressive bacteria. She had to be isolated from her brother and father because the bacteria is highly contagious among cystic fibrosis patients. Cooper took her over to the hospital and got her into isolation.\n\nDaron struggled with having to choose between letting Gracie die alone or being with her and leaving Julian behind without a father. When [[Wyatt Lockhart]] saw Gracie, he proposed a solution, saying that he'd had success treating a similar condition in cancer patients. Daron agreed to try, even after being told it was a long shot.\n\nThey extracted the bacteria from Gracie's lungs and then tried several antibiotic combinations to treat it. However, none of them worked and Pete had to tell Gracie that she was going to die. Unable to watch Gracie die alone, Daron handed Julian and the keys to his house over to the doctors and broke isolation to be with Gracie, exposing himself to the bacteria.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married until his wife died.\n\n===Familial===\n====Children====\nBoth of his children have cystic fibrosis like himself. When he found out Gracie was dying, he chose to be with her and leave Julian to be cared for by someone else.\n\n====Sister====\nHe has a sister in Nashville who doesn't know Gracie.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPP2x12-4.jpg\nPP2x12-10.jpg\nPP2x12-12.jpg\nPP2x12-13.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rousakis, Daron}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S2 Characters]]"}]}}}}
