He consoled Vic when she started crying and told him her grandma had died. He continued to direct her through her rehearsals. He was frustrated when [[Pruitt Herrera]] came in to do an inspection, saying they did it every show and it always ended up being a waste of time and money. Pruitt did the inspection and told Cooper of a few things he needed to change, including fixing the fire curtain and moving part of the set. At a future dress rehearsal, a scrim caught fire and quickly spread. Cooper directed all the people in the theatre, including Vic, to evacuate through the back of the theatre, but stayed behind to move a piano that was on the stage, which he'd previously told Pruitt was very expensive. Vic tried to convince him to leave the theatre, but he refused and ended up catching fire, killing him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married until his death.\n\n==Career==\nHe was a theatre director who worked with [[Victoria Hughes]] before she became a firefighter.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was directing a production of Lady, Be Good when he died.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS193x15-16.jpg\nS193x15-18.jpg\nS193x15-19.jpg\nS193x15-20.jpg\nS193x15-21.jpg\nS193x15-23.jpg\nS193x15-24.jpg\nS193x15-25.jpg\nS193x15-34.jpg\nS193x15-35.jpg\nS193x15-38.jpg\nS193x15-41.jpg\nS193x15-42.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]"}]}}}}
