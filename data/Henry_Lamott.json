Because of his allergy to all pain medications, his doctor prescribed the use of pornography to reduce his pain to a manageable level until his implant was in place.\n\nWhen the power went out at the hospital, Henry's pain worsened without access to pornography. Realizing that he was really in pain without it, Cristina sat down with him and told him an erotic story to reduce his pain.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Marie Lamott]]. They have at least two children together. She says she puts up with him needing constant pornography to control his pain because he takes away her pain.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have at least two children. When the power went out because of the storm, the kids were let out of school early and she had to go to pick them up.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 42 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He's allergic to all pain medication.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lamott, Henry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}]}}}}
