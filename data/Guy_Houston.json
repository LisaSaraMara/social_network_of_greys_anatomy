He was defibrillated in the field and then taken to the hospital, where Maggie saw no fluid around his heart on ultrasound. However, he did have commotio cordis, an interruption of his heart rhythm. She wanted him admitted for observation, but when he coded again in the ER, she said she believed the impact had bruised his heart. He coded a third time and Maggie realized he wouldn't stop until they did the ablation, so he was taken for radio frequency ablation, which was successful. After his procedure, Maggie talked to his mother and told her he'd be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis father has had two heart attacks.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 22 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Houston, Guy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}
