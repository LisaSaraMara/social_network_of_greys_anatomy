Sally often lied to Cora, telling her her mother had just called and said that she loved her.\n\nAs an adult, Cora became Sally's caregiver when she developed dementia. When it had progressed to the point where Sally no longer recognized her, Cora ended up in the hospital with a 12-centimeter pancreatic head tumor. Nick consulted with Meredith about the tumor and she said a traditional Whipple was unlikely to work. Instead, they developed a plan that involved removing all the involved organs, dissecting out the tumor, and then replacing the organs. They talked to Cora about it and she decided to have the surgery despite the risks as she feared leaving her aunt without a caregiver.\n\nThey took her into surgery, where the surgery went well until they went to re-attach her organs. There was unexpected bleeding and as they had no blood available to transfuse given the nationwide blood shortage, they decided to stop the surgery until more blood arrived to avoid additional blood loss. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]])''\n\nWhen Meredith learned that the incoming blood had been destroyed in an accident, she suggested moving Cora to the ICU to keep her alive until they had more blood and could finish her surgery. However, she later coded in the ICU and they were unable to resuscitate her.
