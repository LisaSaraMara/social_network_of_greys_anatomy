She invited Maya to get pizza, but changed the plans to a movie when she learned Maya was on a strict diet. They hung out and studied together, but Hima questioned Maya's strict adherence to her diet and training. The two shared a kiss, but it didn't go much further because after stopping to check on Hima who had tripped during a race, Maya's father drilled into her that she couldn't have any distractions. After winning her next race, Maya brushed off Hima's congratulations.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe and [[Maya Bishop]] had a very brief thing when they met while running.
