He noticed the signs, but didn't know what they meant. When he asked her about them, she bit his head off. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n===Courting Meredith===\nDavid invited Meredith to come to Minnesota as they were dedicating a research library to her mother. When she arrived, he gave her a tour of the facility and told her he was doing additional research into mRNA technology as part of vaccine development and cancer treatment. He then showed her a research lab that he'd had set up and asked her to work there, developing a cure for Parkinson's, a condition which he had.\n\nHe then took her out to dinner, where he elaborated on the proposed treatment and talked to Meredith about his own treatment, which he said usually worked well enough to get him through consults with patients before wearing off. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith considered his offer, she brought Amelia to Minnesota to tour the facility and examine David. She asked if he'd considered options like deep-brain stimulation, but he said he wanted a cure, which is why she was there. They just needed Meredith to say yes. At the end of the day, Meredith said she needed full autonomy to pick the team, wanted everything they learned to be accessible to anyone with Parkinson's, and asked to have the project moved to Grey Sloan. David said he couldn't do that, but did agree to let Meredith set up a satellite lab there so she could do most of her work there and travel to Minnesota once a week. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n===Research Beginnings===\nDavid observed as research began. The first step was proving that the cells could stay alive after being injected. David became irritated when he learned that Meredith had brought Tom Koracick onto the project as Koracick had slept with his daughter, which David didn't like. Meredith reminded him that he had given her full autonomy over the staff for the project and Amelia needed a second neurosurgeon. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n===Increased Urgency===\nOne morning, shortly after Thanksgiving, David called an emergency team meeting. When he arrived, he told them that he had sprained his wrist falling in his bedroom becuase his foot froze up. He was angry because his disease was progressing faster than the research. He demanded they work quicker to meet the FDA's criteria for a one-time compassionate use for him. After a long day of trials, David visited the lab and drew their attention to a sample which had 92% viability, enough to satisfy the FDA's requirement. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\n===Trip to Seattle===\nKnowing doing the surgery in Minnesota would draw too much unwanted attention, David and Kai traveled to Seattle so he could have his surgery there instead once hte FDA approved them to do the surgery within in a limited window. Because of this time limit, David lied and told Meredith he was fine even when he started feeling pain in his abdomen. He then developed a low-grade fever, which he also tried to brush off. Meredith examined him and then ordered a CT, which showed a perforated bowel. Meredith took him into surgery, but he became hypotensive while she scrubbed in, forcing her to rush in soon after and start his surgery. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, Meredith and Kai both chastised him for not telling them about his pain. Meredith said if he did it again, she would leave the program, which would cause the FDA to pull their approval. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\n===Surgery===\nOnce he'd sufficiently healed from that surgery, they prepared for his experimental treatment. On the day of surgery, as he got last-minute tests and they prepared the cells, Hamilton documented the process, saying it was for the book he was planing to write. Hamilton wanted the surgery to be private, but Meredith told him it was teaching hospital and she wanted to open the surgery up for all hospital staff to observe. Hamilton reluctantly agreed. Once everything was ready, Hamilton was taken to the OR, where he was secured into a halo and the cells were injected. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n===Presentation and Meredith's Job Offer===\nBack in Minnesota, Meredith presented Hamilton's case to the staff of the Mayo Clinic. While she reported more scientifically on his progress, he was more grandiose, stating that he and his wife had played chess and his hand hadn't shaken at all. Then he surprised Meredith by offering her a permanent position in front of everyone as director of The Grey Center and Head of General Surgery. Later, away from the crowd, he showed her the new budget that had been approved for the Grey Center, which included her salary. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n===Testing Richard===\nDavid and Kai came to Seattle on Richard's request to test his skills to see if he needed to retire. The testing was interrupted when Richard got a call from Levi Schmitt and left to help him treat his mother, causing Kai to question his judgment, as he hadn't said a word to them before leaving. While Richard spoke to [[Jamarah Blake]] and [[MaryAnn Suchan]] about the residency program, they taped Levi Schmitt speaking about his own experience with the team. Richard then returned to the testing room and completed his tests. Kai told him he'd passed. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married. Prior to his sugery, he left a note for his wife on his computer in case he didn't make it. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n===Familial===\nHe has a daughter and a granddaughter, who is twelve. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")'' Before his surgery, he wrote notes to his children and grandchildren for Meredith to send to them if he didn't make it. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n===Professional===\nHe knew [[Ellis Grey]] when she was alive. He also did the conference circuit with Richard, who said David would make a terrible boss.\n\n==Career==\nHe is an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] at [[Mayo Clinic|The Mayo Clinic]] in Rochester, MN. [[Richard Webber|Dr. Webber]] described him as Minnesota's prized tumor guy. Because of his Parkinson's diagnosis, he is retired from surgery but still consults on general surgery patients. Additionally, because of his diagnosis, he founded [[The Grey Center]] with the hopes of curing his disease.
