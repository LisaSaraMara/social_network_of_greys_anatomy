[[Michael Dixon]] attended the meeting, but [[Travis Montgomery]] missed it due to his work. After the meeting was over, Greer was talking to Dixon as the room was cleaned up when Travis came in. Travis started talking to who he thought were union members only to find out they were just cleaning up. Then he told Greer that none of what was being said about him was true. Greer said he believed that, but that's why coming to the meeting was so important.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a captain for the [[Seattle Fire Department]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greer, Dan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Firefighters]]"}]}}}}
