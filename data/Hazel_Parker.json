After receiving a lap chole, Bradley was in the hospital with hematochezia, blood in the stool. He decided that he would proceed with DCD, Donation after Cardiac Death. Since he was dependent on a ventilator to stay alive, he decided to have it disconnected so his heart would stop, after which his organs would be harvested. While explaining the procedure to his mom, she asked him once again if he was sure. April came in and explained where his organs would be going, which helped his mother cope.\n\nHe was taken into the OR where his breathing tube was disconnected and his heart was allowed to stop. When it stopped, his mother began to cry and held onto him. She had to be pulled away forcibly so that the transplant could proceed.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Nick Parker]]. Together, they have a son, [[Bradley Parker]].\n\n===Familial===\nHer son, Bradley, was diagnosed with ALS during an [[Internal Medicine]] residency. When he told her that he wanted to allow his heart to stop so he could donate his organs, she was supportive. However, when the time came to say goodbye, she found it hard and had to be forcibly removed from the OR so they could operate.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker, Hazel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}]}}}}
