When his cancer returned while Kristen was pregnant, Simon was desperate to live long enough to meet his son before he died. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")'' Simon started chemotherapy treatments with the hope that it would give him enough time to get Kristen to a safe point to have a c-section. During this time, she had some contractions, but they were determined to be Braxton-Hicks. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\n\nWhen Kristen got to 36 weeks, they started to worry that Simon wouldn't make it and put him on ECMO to buy him just a little more time. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")'' Soon afterward, Kristen experienced a placental abruption, forcing an immediate c-section delivery. As soon as he was cleared, Jamal was taken down to see his father, who kissed him and told him hello forever before dying. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis father always wanted to be a dad.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Though his dad has an uncle named Jamal, he was named after his mother.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n18x20-3.jpg\n18x20-4.jpg\n18x20-5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:Jamal Clark]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Clark, Jamal}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}]}}}}
