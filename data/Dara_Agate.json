They walked down to station 19, seeking help. Ben scared them a little, then called for bolt cutters to fire them. Before he could free them, Dara collapsed into a seizure. Ben gave her a sedative, which was ineffective, then moved her into the PRT, where he was able to stop her seizures with difficulty. When she was stable, they asked her if she had epilepsy. She said she did and admitted that she took her bracelet off when she was with Tamil because she didn't want to think she was sick. Tamil told her that he didn't care and asked her not to do anything like that ever again because it scared him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is dating [[Tamil]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She wears a bracelet to alert medical personnel and bystanders that she has epilepsy.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS193x13-16.jpg\nS193x13-17.jpg\nS193x13-66.jpg\nS193x13-67.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Agate, Dara}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
