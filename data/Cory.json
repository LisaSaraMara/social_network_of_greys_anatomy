Hattie called for help and station 19 responded. Maya, Travis, Theo, and Sullivan entered the house to search for them while Hattie remained outside. Maya and Sullivan searched the downstairs while Travis and Theo checked upstairs. Maya and Sullivan found Tobias, who was trapped under a fallen shelf. They freed him and took him out. Then they noticed Travis and Theo weren't reachable by radio. Tobias informed them there was a trap door in the house, so they went back in and searched for it. When they found it, they broke through it and evacuated Travis, Theo, and Cory, who had all fallen down there.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nHe works with [[Tobias]] and [[Hattie]], making documentary films.\n\n==Career==\nHe makes documentary films.\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
