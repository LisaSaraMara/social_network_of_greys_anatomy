He was in AA and sober, but after a consult, he learned he wasn't eligible for the TIPSS procedure and a transplant wasn't an option, so he had no other options left. He refused medication because he wanted to be clean when he met his maker. He also said he wished he could have done something good with the rest of his life. He later died in the hospital.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nHe and Richard met in AA and became friends. He's also friends with other members of AA.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He inspired Meredith's project, which involves growing mini-livers to replace diseased livers.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}
