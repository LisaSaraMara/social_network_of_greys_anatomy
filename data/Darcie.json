She pulled out the knife she was carrying and stabbed him repeatedly with it, then she walked to Station 19 to get help. Officers [[Officer Reaser|Reaser]] and [[Officer Marinis|Marinis]] came to the station to interview her about what had happened. She explained and when she became distressed, they asked for her to be moved to the hospital for an exam and a psych evaluation. Officer Marinis rode in the ambulance with her. On the way to the hospital, she talked about how she never thought it would happen to her. She never ran during the night or in secluded areas, because she always saw reports of people being assaulted and wondered why they'd run at night.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother gave her a knife when she moved to the city. She later used the knife to stab a man who attacked her while she was running in the park.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
