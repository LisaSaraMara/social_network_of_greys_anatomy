He told the doctors he thought he knew what it was, but before he could tell them, his wife, [[Sharon Peters|Sharon]], came in. Owen palpated his abdomen and said he wanted to do an ultrasound because it was distended. The ultrasound showed nothing abnormal, so Owen ordered a CT. Before they could get that, Sharon use Harold's phone to call her own after learning it was at the hospital. It rang and Harold was forced to admit that he'd shoved it into his rectum. He said he'd done it because she was always on her phone. They were able to extract the phone manually, but he later went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated in the ER.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Sharon Peters]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have children.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peters, Harold}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}
