They used a clothesline to play. The tugging motion led to [[Cash Keller|Cash]], Deedee, and [[Jane Keller|Jane]] losing fingers. [[Frances Keller]] was also injured in the game when her hand was crushed.\n\nThe family went together to the ER, where the fingers were matched with their rightful owners. All the fingers were successfully re-attached and Frances was expected to regain full use of her hand after physical therapy. However, when Al tried to say that that it was good that they had family, his brother, [[Tony Keller|Tony]], punched him in the face, giving Al a nosebleed and possibly breaking Tony's hand.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer fingers were amputated at a family reunion. She, among others, blamed her brother [[Al Keller|Al]] for the injuries, as he's the one who planned the family reunion and suggested that they play. She also does not seem to get along well with her sister-in-law, Jane.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keller, Deedee}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}]}}}}
