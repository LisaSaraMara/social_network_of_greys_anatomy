Henry initially believed they were cops, but they showed him they were just there to help. Jack noted that he had a serious cut on his arm that needed treatment or it would get worse. They bandaged him him up.\n\nLater, the camp was raided by cops, who arrested Henry, who had an outstanding warrant for failing to appear in court when he didn't know he had a court date as he was unable to receive mail.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS193x04-1.jpg\nS193x04-2.jpg\nS193x04-4.jpg\nS193x04-10.jpg\nS193x04-11.jpg\nS193x04-12.jpg\nS193x04-13.jpg\nS193x04-14.jpg\nS193x04-15.jpg\nS193x04-17.jpg\nS193x04-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Henry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
