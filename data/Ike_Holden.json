[[Scott Barker]], Ike's surgeon, then came to see him, saying the surgery went well. Cooper said the anesthesia effects would wear off in an hour or so.\n\nWhen the time came for Ike to be discharged, Scott didn't show up, so Cooper did the discharge.\n\nIke later came back to the hospital with ischemia. Scott planned to operate, but Charlotte asked him if he'd taken anything that day. She wouldn't let him operate until he said he hadn't taken anything that day. He wasn't able to say that.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holden, Ike}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}]}}}}
