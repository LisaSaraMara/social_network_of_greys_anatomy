After her mother died, her father backed out more than once on allowing her to have her surgery, which her mother had wanted her to have so she could finally smile like she wanted. On the most recent attempt, her father tried to back out again, but she talked to him and between her and the doctors, they convinced him of the importance of her having the surgery. The surgery went forward and afterward, Daya was told she'd need rehab and speech therapy and that the recovery would take a long time. When [[Katrina Scott]], her algebra teacher, came into the room, she was surprised to see her there. She then learned that her teacher and her father were seeing each other. Her father thought she'd be upset, but she said she was actually trying to smile.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother had died. After her mother's death, her father became much more protective of her and didn't want her to have surgery because he was afraid he'd lose her.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She's 13 and in 8th grade.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burman, Daya}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}]}}}}
