She ultimately died of inflammatory breast cancer.\n\n\n\nShe was born in a two-room shack with an outhouse. ''(\"[[Be Still, My Soul]]\")''\n\nShe and her husband adopted Maggie and raised her. The marriage fell apart while they pretended everything was fine to protect Maggie. Diane started an affair of  years with the man who serviced their car.\n\nDiane was very pleased with how easy Maggie was. She never talked back, she had good grades, and her room was always clean. She was concerned when Maggie left Boston for Seattle and called her a lot, but she was happy Maggie did so after learning about the people she met. About a year after Maggie had left the city, Diane and Bill got a divorce, after which Diane moved to Hawaii to make soaps.\n\n\nWhen Diane noticed a rash, she went to a local doctor and started treatment, but it didn't look good. As she had always taught her daughter to find the smartest person in the room or otherwise another room, she found [[Jackson Avery]] was the best and also a friend of Maggie's. She scheduled an appointment with him. However, realizing that there was a real chance of her dying soon, she started skydiving and traveling the world. ''(\"[[What's Inside]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the time for the appointment came, Diane went to Seattle, a surprise to her daughter. She quickly bonded with all Maggie's colleagues, who all liked her. Jackson examined her rash and took a biopsy, which showed inflammatory breast cancer. She asked him to help her tell Maggie and he said he would and also offered to refer her to local specialists and fly to Hawaii to operate on her.\n\nDiane then went to Meredith's house where she folded laundry, made lasagna, and put the kids to bed. When Maggie came home and confronted her mom about her behavior, Diane decided not to tell her and instead just said she'd leave and when Maggie was ready to have her in her life, she could let Diane know. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\n\nDiane came back to Seattle to have her mastectomy. She'd been going to chemotherapy and was getting a good response, but shocked Jackson by telling him she still hadn't told Maggie about the cancer. She wanted to have the surgery and then tell Maggie, but Jackson said he wouldn't go forward with the surgery until she'd told Maggie. After Maggie came in and tried to be supportive, Diane told Maggie about the breast cancer. The next day, she went in for her surgery, but during surgery, the doctors found something unexpected. ''(\"[[Till I Hear It From You]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her mastectomy, Diane got the news that her cancer had spread. She had surgery to remove more cancer from her body and continued to have radiation and chemotherapy. When she complained of stomach pain, Meredith ordered a new CT, which showed a met near her liver, which was causing the pain. When Meredith advised against removing it, Maggie pressured Diane to fire her. Maggie then found a clinical trial with promising early results that she could get into if they could lower her LFTs. Bailey figured out a way to place a stent to lower Diane's LFTs and get her into the trial. The procedure worked, but Bailey, Richard, and Jackson didn't think the trial was a good idea. Despite this and Richard advising Diane that it wasn't a good idea, Maggie pushed forward and Diane supported her, believing Maggie wouldn't do anything to hurt her.\n\nOnce on the treatment, Diane had multiple side effects. She got an infection in her arm and blood built up. She had to have fluid aspirated from her back, but she eventually started to feel a little better. She taught Maggie to make her lasagna and told Maggie to invite all her friends over to have dinner together. At the dinner, Diane started coughing heavily. She soon coughed up some blood and they rushed her to the hospital. She had a tear in her esophagus, which Richard repaired with difficulty. Maggie wanted to get her up and moving again after the surgery as soon as possible, because she'd lose her spot in the trial if she missed a treatment. Richard went and talked to Diane privately, to tell her she didn't have to keep going with the treatment if she didn't want to. She told him Maggie was a gift to her and if she died, it would give Maggie darkness not to know she did everything she could and she didn't want to do that. Richard told her Maggie was strong and she could handle it. Maggie tried to call around to find newer treatment possibilities for her mother, but Diane told her it was time to stop fighting.\n\nLater, while Diane tried to give Maggie life advice, Maggie painted her nails. When the smell overwhelmed her, Maggie went to open a window and saw that it had stopped raining. When she went back to the bed, her mother was dead. She continued to paint her mom's nails as she cried. ''(\"[[Be Still, My Soul]]\")''\n\nAfter her death, Jackson saw her loaded file that showed her medical history before she came to see him. He discovered she had already found out she was sick before she came to see him, and he guessed that she came to Seattle because he would do everything possible to cure her because of how close he was to Maggie, as well as take care of Maggie if she really were to die. ''(\"[[What's Inside]]\")''\n\n\nDiane appeared in Maggie's fever dream as a beacon of warmth and comfort after Maggie had read Ellis's letter. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to Maggie's father. However, she had a long-term affair with the man who fixed their car. They ultimately split up over it. She said leaving Maggie's father was the moment she finally felt like she could breathe again. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she surprised Maggie with a visit, Maggie was upset that she didn't give her advance warning that she was coming. Maggie also disliked how she quickly bonded with the other doctors at the hospital. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")'' She told Meredith she always wanted to have more kids, so Maggie could have a brother or sister. She was glad when Maggie found Meredith. ''(\"[[Be Still, My Soul]]\")''\n\n\nDiane quickly bonded with all Maggie's colleagues. She made plans to have dinner with Richard, but cancelled those plans when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\nWhile she was in chemo, she also formed a relationship with her nurse, Aurora, to the point where she knew Aurora's son, Lee, was re-taking his driver's test, which he'd failed twice before. ''(\"[[Be Still, My Soul]]\")''\n\n\nShe made soap in Hawaii.\n\n\n*She brought her engagement ring to Seattle with her to give to Maggie.<ref>[[Be Still, My Soul]], x</ref>\n*She was afraid of heights.<ref>[[What's Inside]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxDianePierce.png|[[None of Your Business]]\nxDianePierce.png|[[Till I Hear It From You]]\nxDianePierce.png|[[Be Still, My Soul]]\nxDianePierce.png|[[The Makings of You]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Diane Pierce Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Diane Pierce]]\n[[de:Diane Pierce]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pierce, Diane}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She spent four months waiting for a heart transplant before one came through. The transplant was successful and Ivy began to recover. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-op, Ivy's indices were good and she was recovering well. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLater, Ivy spiked a fever. Cristina took her to the OR for a biopsy, which revealed that she was rejecting her donor heart. They treated it with anti-rejection medication and put Ivy back on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well.

''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Ivy was in surgery getting her new heart, [[Jon McNeil]] brought their second child, Frankie, into the ER because she was coughing up pink fluid. She, too, was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. The doctors inserted a pacemaker.

''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nWhile playing Hide and Seek with [[Braden Morris]], Frankie collapsed in a hallway. When she was found, her pulse was weak and she wasn't breathing well. She was taken into surgery to insert an LVAD and then she was put on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nFrankie's LVAD failed to reverse the heart damage, which left her in desperate need of a heart. One became available, but when they transplanted it, they discovered that it had been damaged during retrieval and couldn't keep her alive. When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting in Frankie\us room while the doctors talked to his parents, Link started to cough up pink fluid just as Frankie had. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nLink was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and declined quickly. They attempted to put him on a Berlin Heart, but he was clotting too much. They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLink's heart pump worked well, keeping him stable as he waited for a heart transplant. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nLink was later discharged and allowed to wait for a heart transplant at home. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\nA heart became available for Link during the aftermath of the explosion at the Mall of the Woods. Despite this, they had Link come in to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for his transplant. The transplant was successful. ''(\"[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Link's heart transplant, [[Maggie Pierce]], who was looking into genetic causes of cardiomyopathy for another patient, discovered what had caused the McNeil kids' cardiomyopathy.

Jeremy was in a rush to get out of the hospital as quickly as possible so he could get back to work, so he agreed to skip a less invasive test and go straight to esophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, the EGD revealed a large tumor, which the doctors determined to be adenocarcinoma. His diet caused severe acid reflux, which made his esophagus the perfect breeding ground for cancer.

Cristina took her to the OR for a biopsy, which revealed that she was rejecting her donor heart. They treated it with anti-rejection medication and put Ivy back on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well.

She, too, was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. The doctors inserted a pacemaker.

''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nWhile playing Hide and Seek with [[Braden Morris]], Frankie collapsed in a hallway. When she was found, her pulse was weak and she wasn't breathing well.

When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow.

''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nLink was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and declined quickly. They attempted to put him on a Berlin Heart, but he was clotting too much. They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up.

A mutation called RAF  had been discovered to cause cardiomyopathy only a week before and all three McNeil children had that mutation. Sabine was relieved that it wasn't something in their house or something she had done.

When the stress of their three kids being in the hospital started to get to them, they fought, Jon walked out, and Sabine wondered if it would destroy their marriage. However, Jon came back, saying that he had fallen asleep in the car and his phone had died. He apologized and they made up.\n\n\nJon has three children, all of whom had been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. His middle child, Frankie, ultimately died of her condition, while Ivy and Link received heart transplants.\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nBoth Sabine and Jon grew to know and trust Cristina Yang while their children were hospitalized.

Four years later, he was undergoing chemoradiation to treat mets in his lungs. Kristen found him struggling to breathe in the nursery trying to assemble a crib. They admitted him and ordered a CT, which showed a mass in his ileum that was obstruction his bowel, likely the cause of his pain. Jo operated with the hope of resecting the tumor and reducing his pain, which would buy him more time, as his wife was  weeks pregnant and he was desperate to live long enough to meet his son. However, when they opened, Jo found that the tumor was too invasive, so instead of removing the tumor, she performed an ileostomy to make him more comfortable and buy him a little more time. After his surgery, Jo told Kristen that he had a month at most to live. Kristen asked them to do a c-section immediately so he could meet his son, but Jo said it wasn't safe because she was too early. Link said he'd check with [[Carina DeLuca]], giving Kristen hope, but Carina also said no. Kristen then went to Simon and told him he needed to live to meet his son. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, Simon started chemotherapy treatments to try to buy him enough time to meet his child. While he was getting treatment, he and Kristen did puzzles to pass the time. [[Catherine Fox]] got her treatments at the same time as his and they talked as well. When Kristen began having contractions and needed to go upstairs to be examined, Catherine sent Richard up with her so she wouldn't have to go alone since Simon couldn't go with her. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\nSimon continued receiving supportive care as Kristen's pregnancy continued into the final weeks. When he struggled to breathe, he asked them not to intubate him, fearing the tube would never come out, but desperate for Simon to meet their son, Kristen authorized it. A CT showed that his mets had grown and he had new ones. Kristen then made the decision to have the doctors put Simon on ECMO to buy him a little more time, even though they warned her she might later have to decide to turn off the machines. While Simon was being connected to the machines, Link brought her food and assured her she wasn't being selfish trying to get Simon to live long enough to meet their son. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\nWhile sitting by Simon's bedside, Kristen started having sharp pains in her abdomen, which she hoped were the start of labor. Jo told her they needed to go up to OB so she could give Kristen a proper exam, but as they moved, Kristen experienced a particularly sharp pain and started bleeding vaginally. They immediately rushed her upstairs into surgery so they could do a c-section. After the baby was delivered, Jo was forced to do a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding. Kristen was stable and awake after her surgery and told her newborn son how much his father had loved him. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to [[Simon Clark]] until his death. He was diagnosed with cancer shortly after they got married.\n\nThey used to live in a two-story townhouse with an upstairs office Kristen was convinced was haunted. When she would go up there, Simon would say, \"Goodbye forever.\" When he was diagnosed with cancer, she asked him to stop, so he started saying, \"Hello forever,\" a habit that continued through the rest of their marriage until Simon's death.

She spent four months waiting for a heart transplant before one came through. The transplant was successful and Ivy began to recover. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-op, Ivy's indices were good and she was recovering well. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLater, Ivy spiked a fever. Cristina took her to the OR for a biopsy, which revealed that she was rejecting her donor heart. They treated it with anti-rejection medication and put Ivy back on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nIvy was later discharged to recover at home. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Ivy was in surgery getting her new heart, [[Jon McNeil]] brought their second child, Frankie, into the ER because she was coughing up pink fluid. She, too, was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. The doctors inserted a pacemaker. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks after her pacemaker was inserted, Frankie was doing well, even walking around the hospital. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nWhile playing Hide and Seek with [[Braden Morris]], Frankie collapsed in a hallway. When she was found, her pulse was weak and she wasn't breathing well. She was taken into surgery to insert an LVAD and then she was put on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nFrankie's LVAD failed to reverse the heart damage, which left her in desperate need of a heart. One became available, but when they transplanted it, they discovered that it had been damaged during retrieval and couldn't keep her alive. When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting in Frankie\us room while the doctors talked to his parents, Link started to cough up pink fluid just as Frankie had. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nLink was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and declined quickly. They attempted to put him on a Berlin Heart, but he was clotting too much. They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLink's heart pump worked well, keeping him stable as he waited for a heart transplant. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nLink was later discharged and allowed to wait for a heart transplant at home. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\nA heart became available for Link during the aftermath of the explosion at the Mall of the Woods. Despite this, they had Link come in to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for his transplant. The transplant was successful. ''(\"[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Link's heart transplant, [[Maggie Pierce]], who was looking into genetic causes of cardiomyopathy for another patient, discovered what had caused the McNeil kids' cardiomyopathy. A mutation called RAF  had been discovered to cause cardiomyopathy only a week before and all three McNeil children had that mutation. Sabine was relieved that it wasn't something in their house or something she had done.

While she was examining Liz, she noticed that her son, Noah, had an unnatural-sounding laugh. She asked Alex and Amelia to take a look at him. They took him for an MRI and while he was gone, Liz started to panic that she had missed something and started bleeding. She was rushed into the OR for a cervical cerclage. While Arizona worked, Liz explained that she had been with the baby's father, Mike, but she left him because he always referred to the baby as their baby but Noah as her son and she knew she'd have a husband, but her son wouldn't have a father. After she ended things, she cried every day, which she thinks might be the reason she didn't notice his laugh changing. After her cerclage, she learned that her son's tumor was too close to his brainstem and was inoperable, though Amelia and Alex believed the research they were doing for [[Kimmie Park]] might also work for Noah.

While they were cleaning his head laceration, he had a tonic clonic seizure. It was prolonged, so they ordered lorazepam to stop it. However, before it could be retrieved, the seizing stopped. Because he had urinated on himself, Meredith said he'd need new sheets and a gown.\n\nAlone in the room, Meredith continued to work on him.

She is the biological child of [[Ellis Grey]] and [[Richard Webber]] and thus half-sister to [[Meredith Grey]]. She is married to [[Winston Ndugu]].\n\n\n\nMaggie is very driven and finished both high school and medical school faster than normal. She worked extremely hard and was a focused student. She states that she graduated early from Yale, but it is unknown whether this was in reference to undergrad or medical school.\ua\n\n\nMaggie interviewed for the position of head of cardiothoracic surgery at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She was hired soon after. Her flight to Seattle from Boston was one of the worst flying experiences ever. Due to some technical issue, the plane stayed on the tarmac and the passengers had to remain in their seats. It was very hot on the plane and they were not allowed to use the restroom or given any water. Eventually, after four hours, the flight was just cancelled with no apology whatsoever.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x </ref>\n\nTwo weeks after being hired, Maggie told [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] that she was adopted, and that  years prior, she looked for her birth mom and needed to go to the court for the records. She found out that she was dead, but got her name, and discovered that she was an amazing surgeon that worked at the [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], now [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], Maggie's current workplace. She stated that that's not why she took the job, but it's \"a little bit\" why she took the interview. When Richard asked Maggie what her mother's name was, she said that it was [[Ellis Grey]].<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nMaggie quickly began to integrate into the hospital, getting to know everyone, and how things work. However, she butted heads with [[Meredith Grey]] over a case. This came to a head when Maggie told Meredith that Ellis Grey is her birth mom.<ref>[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]], x</ref>\n\n\nDerek and Meredith decided to have Maggie come over to their house for dinner, to get to know Maggie better. After Maggie said yes, Derek thought it was a good idea to ask Richard as well. Richard at first thought it was a bad idea because Maggie was going and he didn't want to ruin it, because Maggie and Richard were not okay. The night of the dinner, Maggie and Richard showed up, but no one opened the door. She talked to Richard for a few minutes, making it clear to him that he's not her dad, and then left.<ref>[[Don't Let's Start]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith ended up in a bind with no one to watch her kids, so Maggie offered to watch them.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n\n\nIn the ER, Maggie treated a patient with what looked like Alzheimer's. While trying to get the patient stabilized, he accidentally hit Maggie on her cheek and eye, causing her to fall. Later, Richard asked Maggie if she was okay and Maggie responded that she was, but then said she thought she had a concussion. Maggie later complained about the patient to Richard Webber, who then revealed that her mother, Ellis Grey, had Alzheimer's.<ref>[[Don't Dream It's Over]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie finds out about Derek's death.]]Maggie was one of the first people to find out about Derek's death as she was present when Meredith returned to Grey Sloan to announce his death. She presumably attended Derek's funeral. Shortly after, Meredith disappeared with her kids without leaving other than a small note saying she and the kids were fine. Over the year that Meredith was gone, Maggie continued to bond with her colleagues, especially Alex and confessed to him that she felt abandoned by Meredith, now that they finally got to be somewhat of a family. They celebrated the holidays with other colleagues. She became a little closer to Richard when she invited him for Christmas, as he appeared to be a little lonely. She also defended him when Catherine stated he was too romantic for her. Maggie said that being romantic probably made him feel good about himself. When Meredith finally returned, she hung with Maggie and Alex while they informed her about the past year.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile Maggie and her colleagues were busy dealing with\ua[[Keith Gardner]]\uaafter a tunnel collapse, Maggie got a phone call from her mother, who informed her that her parents were getting a divorce. Maggie was emotional about this, but she didn't want to bother her colleagues about it.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Meredith bought her house back from Alex, she invited Maggie and Amelia to move in with her. They assisted Meredith in caring for her kids. Maggie also often mediated between Meredith and Amelia, who frequently got into fights over little things. She often helped with Meredith's three kids, with each \"sister\" in charge of getting one kid ready for the day.\n\n\nAfter a short conversation and a few drinks, Maggie ends up making out with Andrew and sleeps with him. After that night, Maggie and Andrew agree that it was a one-time thing only that day, but only to have sex again minutes after agreeing. Shortly after, Maggie and Andrew went public with their relationship. Andrew became uncomfortable with dating an attending and started avoiding Maggie. After she confronted him, they broke up.\n\n\nHer mother came to the hospital to visit Maggie and see Jackson to get rid of a rash, which turned out to be inflammatory breast cancer. Diane and Jackson were gonna tell Maggie before Diane left, but they got into a fight and never got to talk about the cancer. A few months later, when Diane returned to have surgery, Maggie kept thinking that her mother was getting breast implants and failed to understand why continuously trying to talk her mother out of it. When Diane later told Maggie the truth about her breast cancer, Maggie immediately started looking at her charts. Over the next few months, Maggie helped her mom through everything and stated her opinion about what she should do, which her mother followed. After Maggie butted heads with Meredith, Diane fired her from her mother's case. Maggie found a clinical trial and signed her mom up for it, although the trial did more harm than good.\n\nAfter she stated that she wasn't ready for her mom to go, Meredith told her to listen to her mom and record her voice in her mind. The next day, Maggie was talking to her mom and painting her nails. Diane gave her advice including to have some fun in her life and to be a little lazy or slutty and to make a mistake. When Maggie went to open a window, she came back to find that her mom had died. Later on, she was seen hugging her mom's lifeless body with Meredith and Amelia in the room. Her dad came in and she hugged him.\n\n\nMaggie bonded with Jackson after her mother's death. They frequently talked at work and they were together when the explosion caused a fire at the hospital. Jackson rushed off to go find Stephanie, which worried Maggie. She later confronted him about it in front of April, who later pointed out that she felt like Maggie liked Jackson and that he liked her back, which she recognized. Maggie was unsure how she felt about that as she hadn't thought about Jackson in that way until April suggested it.\n\nAwkwardness ensued in her talks with Jackson as she was constantly walking on eggshells in order not to give him signals. He picked up on her weird behavior and she later came clean about what had transpired between her and April. While initially brushing it off, it also made Jackson look at Maggie in another way. Both were in for a cold shower when Catherine, after a family dinner with Richard and Jackson that Maggie attended, referred to Maggie as Jackson's sister.\n\nEventually, they did start dating. Their relationship progressed, and Maggie became more integrated into Jackson's family. They soon exchanged 'I love you's' and, months later, decided to move in together. Maggie was able to help Jackson through Catherine's tumor surgery, as Maggie had been through a similar situation with her own mother's illness.\n\n\nMaggie decided to chase after Jackson. She eventually heard him responding to her calls right when [[Victoria Hughes]] arrived with her aid car. She instructed Maggie to wait out on the street while she helped Jackson out of his predicament with [[Mari Prishna]] and [[Jai Prishna]]. Maggie then got on the ambulance with Jai and Jackson. After they arrived at the hospital, Jai was taken into the ER. Maggie and Jackson sat in the rig in silence and eventually agreed to talk about their fight when their temper had settled. He approached her after a week to inform her that Mari and Jai were doing fine. She was happy about that, but she was still angry at him for abandoning her in the car in the woods, while he just thought of it as \"taking a walk.\" She decided she was still too angry to talk and left.\n\nA week later, she joined Jackson as he was trying to figure out why Jai had had an apparent stroke. He brought up Mari hanging onto him for hours, nearly losing her arm in the process, which led to him on life support after excruciating surgeries due to something being irreparably broken inside him. He was wondering if Mari should have let go back at that cliff. Maggie understood he was using them as a metaphor for their broken relationship and that he thought it was time to let go. She agreed. The break-up stuck as she wanted someone who didn't abandon her over and over again. While she thought they would go back to being friends, she found him pretty defensive when she inquired about him and Vic after she saw them together. He told her they were just friends, but added it was none of her business. She agreed, since they apparently didn't like each other enough to even be friends.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShe and Amelia went to collect some of Maggie's stuff from Jackson's penthouse. After Maggie told her she had to tell Link about her pregnancy, Amelia showed her Jackson had posted a photo on social media with #Freedom in the caption. Maggie hated how he was sending her a message through Instagram. In the hospital parking lot, a scooter crashed into her car. Maggie and Owen took [[Reid Kim]], the driver, to a trauma room. En route there, they ran into Jackson and she made a mean comment about his freedom now that he was dating a firefighter instead of an intellectually challenging woman. Meanwhile, Reid was diagnosed with a few broken ribs. They told him he was lucky and he told Maggie she was, too, since she ran into him. She denied as she was standing still when he crashed into her car, after which he deteriorated. It was discovered he had a cardiac tamponade. They relieved the tamponade and managed to resuscitate him after extensive efforts. He made it through surgery and Maggie briefed Reid's girlfriend Tara in the ICU. Tara openly wondered why she was staying with someone who treated her as terribly as Reid did. Maggie drew parallels from her relationship with Jackson and guessed that things were good in the beginning, but then she noticed some red flags, which she ignored because dating is hard, especially for successful women. She advised Tara to leave Reid before he left her because that could leave her feeling like a victim, which she thought was so much worse than ripping that Band-Aid off herself. Afterward, she ran into Jackson, who told her she was wrong about Vic. She apologized for her comment but pointed out he had been spiteful with his caption, even if he hadn't meant to be.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nThe break-up continued to be hard on her as she kept having dreams about Jackson with Victoria thrown in the mix, too. She hated how he walked out of the fog with a new girlfriend like she never existed. Amelia informed her she and Link were keeping the baby. Amelia had trouble with keeping the secret as it clashed with her rigorous honesty but Maggie told her that privacy and honesty weren't mutually exclusive. While her experiences with love had led her to believe love wasn't worth it due to all the heartbreak, loss, back-stabbing, and pettiness, witnessing the reunion between [[Bertram Hollister]] and [[Soyoung Oh]] showed her what true love looked like. On her way home, she ran into Vic, who told her she didn't want things to be awkward. Maggie admitted she felt Jackson had moved on a little too fast to her liking and proceeded to unsuccessfully assure Vic that things weren't awkward at all.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith's article was inadvertently turned into an attack on Grey Sloan, Bailey was worried that the stress of the article's fall-out was getting to her heart. Maggie did a full cardiac work-up, which revealed her heart was fine. Given her hot flashes and mood swings, Maggie suggested it might be hormonal and drew blood for a full panel. Meanwhile, Maggie, Teddy, and Link tried to save a patient who was hit by a stowaway whose frozen body had fallen out of a plane but they failed given the extensive injuries. After the surgery, she got Bailey's results and went to tell her that, while she was indeed perimenopausal as suspected, she was also pregnant.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref> After an extensive surgery made her feel more than she'd ever felt during her relationship with Jackson, Maggie found comfort in the realization that surgery was her truest love, which she thought might never change. She joined Meredith and Amelia while they were waiting for updates on Zola's shunt revision.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Maggie got the kids ready for school while Meredith was in jail for the hours of community service she had missed. After school, the kids came to the hospital but Zola refused to go to daycare because it was for little children. Since Maggie had surgery, she convinced Andrew to watch her and assured him it'd be easy with Zola just reading her book or sitting in the OR gallery. Maggie later took the kids trick-or-treating and helped them sort the candy afterward.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Catherine returned to Seattle after a long absence, she ran into Maggie and asked how things were going at the hospital. During their conversation, Maggie learned that Jackson hadn't told her about their breakup yet. She went to confront him about that but their bickering on the matter was interrupted by the arrival of [[Sabrina Webber]], whom Maggie noticed had an uncanny resemblance to her. Maggie approached her and heard they were looking for Richard. Maggie introduced herself to Sabrina and her father [[Chris Webber]] and learned they were her cousin\uaand uncle. They knew about Maggie, who offered to drive them to Pac-North to see Richard. En route, she learned Chris and Sabi knew a lot about her and Sabi addressed the uncanny resemblance between them, which she proved by taking a picture of the two of them together. Chris commented on her lack of knowledge about them was due to Richard's being ashamed of them, though Sabi disagreed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Maggie tries to convince Sabi that she is the best to operate on her.]]\nAt Pac-North, they met up with Richard, who hadn't seen his family in five years. Sabi declined a tour and showed Maggie and Richard a picture of the massive cardiac tumor she had been diagnosed with back home. Maggie did a quick exam and decided they needed scans to get an updated view of the tumor. They exchanged phone numbers while waiting for the scan and learned they had a lot in common, like their love for crossword puzzles. While Sabi was in the scanner, Richard told her he hadn't told her about his family because they believed he thought he was better than them and he wanted to protect her from that. The scans then revealed the tumor had grown considerably and infiltrated its surrounding tissues.\n\nMaggie presented Sabi and Chris with the facts and offered to operate today but Sabi had reservations about being operated on by her family. Maggie stated she was the best and she wasn't sure the family rule applied since they had only known each other for two hours. Chris then pointed out she just steamrolled all of Sabi's concerns without listening, which he thought she inherited from Richard. Maggie disagreed and said her concerns were just not valid. Richard didn't have her back and said he'd page the on-call cardio surgeon. Maggie was upset with him for that and he explained this experience could lead to her growing closer with Sabi, which could all be jeopardized if something went wrong in that OR. Maggie pointed out Sabi came here for help from a doctor and she thought it was a shame Richard couldn't think like one. However, she did agree to consult with the cardio surgeon. However, while Maggie was out getting coffee, Sabi started crashing. Maggie rushed back to the room. Since the surgery was now urgent, Richard convinced Chris to consent to letting Maggie operate. The surgery went well until Sabi started clotting. The perfusionist hadn't informed her that Sabi's clotting time had stopped rising, as Pac-North's protocol was for the surgeon to ask, despite being given multiple doses of heparin. Maggie then realized Sabi was heparin-resistant. Maggie rushed to replace the bypass. Alex found her working frantically to save Sabi's life and concluded it was too late; Sabi was already brain dead. She stepped back and Alex called time of death. While on her way to talk to Chris and Richard, she saw a text from Richard and the picture of her and Sabi. She started to break down and Alex took her into a supply closet so she could get it all out. She composed herself and then informed Sabi's family. Chris yelled at her for operating on Sabi against Sabi's wishes, after which he stormed off. Richard and Catherine left to take Chris to go say goodbye to Sabi, leaving a broken down Maggie behind.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie accompanied Meredith, Andrew, Alex, and Amelia to a hotel for Meredith's hearing before the medical board, though she retreated to the hotel bar rather than attend the hearing. She got drunk and started explaining how Sabi died to a bartender. Jackson found her in the bar. He had heard about Sabi's death from his mother. Maggie told him she was afraid Richard would never speak to him again, which she couldn't blame him for. Jackson decided to take her home she could continue drinking there. At the house, Jackson told her he suspected Richard and Catherine were having issues but she didn't know anything about that. They then received word that Meredith got to keep her license. She realized she hadn't helped at all though he pointed out a drunk testimony wouldn't have helped. They laughed and he confessed he had missed talking to her about their lives. They nearly kissed until he backed off, saying he couldn't do it. Maggie then threw him out at the exact moment Meredith came home. Meredith asked what happened and Maggie replied she hated someone she used to love.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie and Meredith returned to work on the same day. Her first case back was [[Elliott Calhoun]], who needed an aortic valve replacement. Maggie was surprised to learn Elliott's wife [[Finley Calhoun|Finley]] had given birth to their son prematurely, adding to the pressure of the case. Maggie asked Teddy to scrub in with her. While Teddy wondered why Maggie needed help on such an easy procedure, she gladly accepted to operate on non-traumatized hearts again. During the surgery, Maggie continuously asked about the activated clotting time. Teddy brought up Owen had offered her to come run Cardio at Pac-North but Maggie scolded her for chit-chatting. Shortly before the procedure was done, Tom complimented Teddy's technique from the gallery. Maggie wondered why Teddy wasn't telling him he didn't have a future with her. Teddy was then paged away to the ER, leaving Maggie to take Elliott off bypass by herself. She did so but the heart didn't restart, causing her to panic. Teddy was brought back in and she found Maggie pondering what she did wrong. Teddy suggested they were faced with hibernating myocardium given the fact that Elliott had been on bypass multiple times. Teddy recommended they keep Elliott in the OR for a few hours as his heart would most likely restart. Since Maggie wasn't feeling like telling his family that he had died, she agreed. Maggie went to inform Finley, who didn't quite understand. Maggie couldn't handle it and left. She ran into Tom and resigned. He tried to convince her not to but she said she had lost faith in her abilities and couldn't do her job without that. After watching Elliott from the gallery, Maggie went home.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie spent her day sleeping on the couch. Andrew came by after work to inform her that Elliott's heart had indeed restarted. Maggie was relieved to hear that and Andrew asked her for advice on his problem with Meredith. Maggie pointed out he had hurt a woman who had been hurt more than enough for a lifetime. Her short-lived happiness was cut short when a woman dropped by to serve her with a lawsuit. She found out Chris was suing her for Sabrina's wrongful death.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie continued to shut everyone out. Eventually, Richard came by the house. He wanted to take her out to eat but seeing her made him realize it was better for them to eat in. While looking for things he could cook for her, Maggie told him she didn't deserve compassion from him. Richard disagreed and offered to let her talk to Pac-North's new psychologist, which led her to freak out. She realized she was being awful and requested to be left alone. Richard ignored her and said they'd start with coffee. Over coffee, he asked her why she quit since she was Sabi's only shot. He explained he couldn't look at her after Sabi's death not because of what she did but because of what he had done to her. He had sent her in there knowing Sabi was unlikely to survive. Maggie told him Sabi had died because she forgot to ask about the clotting time, which made her think she didn't belong in the OR. She asked him to leave. He left but much to her surprise, he returned soon after with food. He started to make pancakes for her and she begged him to yell at her, knowing he had lost more than she had. Richard told her about one of the few lessons his mother taught him before her death: talking problems out over pancakes. Over pancakes, Richard admitted had wondered about what he could have done differently. Maggie took all the blame but Richard says being imperfect meant she was human. She admitted no one had ever had to tell her that before. He advised her to let her insurance settle with Chris so he would get the sense that something came from Sabi's death. Richard told her quitting now meant quitting on all the lives only she could save, which he knew Sabi wouldn't want. Maggie wished she had known Sabi better. Richard offered to let her ask all the questions about Sabi she wanted since he felt like talking about his niece.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\n\nMaggie is open-hearted, optimistic and she believes in everybody and wants them to be their best.\uaShe describes herself as a big control freak, resulting in a great professional drive and her being unable to leave things unfinished. She is also described as perky and chatty, often putting her in awkward situations when she's not up to date on other people's personal life.\n\n\n\nDean\nShe was dating a man named Dean who loved to cuddle. But since she can't sleep with someone lying next to her, she would sneak out after he fell asleep and spend the night on the couch before returning in the morning before he woke up. He eventually proposed and she explained the sleeping to him, telling him he could sleep in a room down the hall. He didn't want a woman who didn't sleep in the same room as him. He is now married to a woman who loves cuddling.<ref>[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ethan Boyd]]\nShe also dated a radiologist named Ethan shortly after arriving at Grey Sloan Memorial. He pursued her with compliments, but Maggie played hard to get. They were hot and heavy for six months until she got bored and let it fizzle out.\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nMaggie ends up making out and sleeping with intern [[Andrew DeLuca]] after a short conversation and a couple of drinks at Joe's.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie freaks out the next day, and in an office in the hospital, they have a conversation about last night and agree it was a one-time thing. They shake on it before they once again start kissing and proceed to undress.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after they went public, Andrew became uncomfortable with the way things changed when people knew he was seeing an attending and he started to avoid her. When she confronted him, he broke up with Maggie.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nMaggie had a crush on Nathan, and later she asked him out, but on Meredith's request, he declined.\n\n[[Clive Johnson]]\nMaggie matched with Clive on Tinder. They set up a date that\uaMaggie forgot about. Clive showed up at her work to pick her up.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\uaThey kept going on dates, one of which she left early because she forgot about her dancing class with Richard.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith and Amelia wanted to meet Clive, so Maggie decided to host a game night. Clive's wife showed up. Maggie was devastated that she was seeing a married guy. This caused\uathem to break up.\uaJackson told Clive to forget Maggie's address and to never call her again.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nAfter Maggie broke up with Clive, Jackson came by the house after he himself broke up with his new girlfriend Priya. He then confessed he had been thinking about Maggie every time instead of Priya. He knew Maggie found their situation too complicated, but he professed his affection for her anyway. They then ended up kissing.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nJackson asked Maggie out, but she denied,\uasaying\uashe needed to focus on her surgery. Later, she paged Jackson for a consult, though he\uawas hoping it was about the dinner. After work, Maggie saw Jackson at the bar. She wanted to leave but decided to stay. They talked and Jackson asked her out to dinner again and she agreed.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Maggie and Jackson were making out in the closet, they decided to have dinner at his place instead. As they opened the door sharing one last kiss, Richard and Catherine were both staring at them. Maggie awkwardly walked away and Jackson closed the door in embarrassment. Maggie told Meredith that she felt like a teenager. Jackson fixed things with his mother and Richard and Maggie was glad that they weren't an obstacle in\uatheir relationship.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen April was having her crisis of faith, she kissed Jackson. Maggie found out about this and was upset\uathat Jackson didn't tell her.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref> She wanted Jackson to apologize but he didn't know what he did wrong. Later, she showed up at Jackson's house and they made up and had sex.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nWhen they both received invitations for Jo's and Alex's wedding, they decided to go together as a couple.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and Maggie broke up shortly after they went camping.\n\n[[Winston Ndugu]]\nWinston was one of her residents at [[Tufts Medical Center|Tufts]]. She felt elated around him except when they were in the OR. He also had a crush on her but was too nervous to admit it because she was younger than him, but his chief resident. He was going to ask her out when he became an attending but she moved to Seattle. They met at a conference in California and instantly hit it off. They got to know each other in the short time they had. When the conference was over, he came up to Maggie and proposed either him moving to Seattle or her moving to Boston. Maggie told him she was the kind of person who needed time to make big decisions like that, and he told her to take the time she needed.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> When the Covid- pandemic started, Winston and Maggie would talk over the phone until Winston moved to Seattle to be with Maggie. Winston was granted permission to operate at Grey Sloan, but he still had a job at Tufts Medical Center. Maggie told him she was willing to move back to Boston to be with him, but he said they both knew she wouldn't. Later that same day, Winston proposed and Maggie said yes.  \n\nParents\nShe describes her parents as good, funny, kind, and goofy. She says her parents don't understand what she does or why she likes doing it. About two years after she started working at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], her mother confessed to her that she'd been having an affair with their car serviceman for eleven years and they had only stayed together for her sake, but were getting a divorce now that she was out on her own.\ua\n\nGrandparents\nAll her grandparents are still living.\n\nShe has a grandmother who refers to her vagina as \"lady place\" and is not shy about talking about it.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\nMaggie never met her birth mother, but  years prior to joining the\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] staff, she looked for her birth mother and found out that she was dead, but got her name. After learning that Maggie is her half-sister, Meredith gave Maggie Ellis' journals, so Maggie could get an idea of what Ellis was like.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nMaggie met her birth father unknowingly when she arrived at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Maggie quickly bonded with Webber while they worked together. She admired his skill greatly. When he eventually tried to tell her that he's her biological father, she became upset with him for having not told her right away.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMaggie and her maternal half-sister Meredith didn't get along at first because Meredith thought she had come to Seattle looking for money or to profit from Ellis's reputation. They fought over little things and about patients. Derek planned a family dinner for himself, Meredith, Maggie, and Richard to smooth things over but he and Meredith ended up having sex in the shower and missing the dinner, hurting Maggie's feelings.<ref>[[Don't Let's Start]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith confronted her about it, she told Meredith that the reason she was sad about the dinner being canceled was that she was excited to talk to people and eat food that wasn't from a packet and socialize. Meredith then invited Maggie to Ellis's old house to socialize with Callie and Alex.<ref>[[Could We Start Again, Please?]], x</ref> \n\nOver time, Maggie and Meredith grew closer and now they have a good  relationship.\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAlthough having no legal or blood relation to Amelia, Maggie considers herself Amelia's sister (through Meredith). Amelia reciprocates this as Amelia was comfortable enough to speak to Maggie about race. Despite appreciating Amelia's sincerity, she advised Amelia to check her white privilege and to not treat her as the spokeswoman for all black people.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Amelia shut\uaLink out, Maggie tried to bring her breakfast, but Amelia refused, saying she wanted to be alone. She reminded Maggie of the space they'd given her after Sabi, and Maggie reluctantly agreed. However, she came back, saying that she was an only child and therefore needed independent space to solve her problems, but Amelia grew up in a wolf pack, and wolves only go off on their own to die. She sat down by Amelia and listened to her talk about her worries about Link and the baby. Later that night, when Link tried to visit Amelia, Maggie lied for Amelia until Amelia came downstairs herself.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nCristina and Maggie first met when Cristina interviewed Maggie for the head of cardio position at GSM. Despite feeling that Maggie was very young to do the job, she told Owen that she was qualified to do it.\n\nOnce she was officially hired, Maggie became frustrated because Cristina didn't respect her as her new boss. On Cristina's last day, she scheduled a pediatric heart transplant (for [[Lincoln McNeil|Link McNeil]]) amidst the chaos of the explosion at the mall, much to Maggie's confusion and frustration. Cristina even treated her as a resident by not listening to her objections and practically forcing her to prepare Link for the surgery. Maggie ultimately did the transplant herself as Cristina had to leave to catch her flight.\n\n\nPierce is the current [[Attending#Department Head|Co-Head]] of [[Cardiothoracic Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] with [[Teddy Altman]].\n\nShe finished high school, college, and [[Medical School|med school]] early. After med school, she began and subsequently completed a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Tufts Medical Center]]. At twenty-five, she began her [[Fellow|cardiothoracic surgery fellowship]]. Some time after, she was promoted to head the cardiothoracic surgical department.\n\nTwo years later, Pierce applied for the Head of Cardio position at Grey Sloan Memorial and succeeded [[Jeff Russell]] as the new department head. Despite having submitted her notice of resignation very early in her tenure for personal reasons, she was convinced to remain at her post by [[Derek Shepherd]].\n\nShe quit her job when losing [[Sabrina Webber]] caused her to lose faith in her own abilities, which she deemed necessary for her job. She was then made an offer by [[Richard Webber]] to come run the Cardio department at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]]. She accepted the offer but the hospital was purchased by the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]] and closed down on her first day. Like all other staff, she had to interview for a job at Grey Sloan with [[Tom Koracick]] and ended up hired as Co-Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, sharing the job with Teddy, who had been hired to replace Maggie after she quit.\n\n\n*Maggie finished high school and medical school early.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n*The writers stated they knew about Maggie's existence since the very beginning and wanted to introduce the character ever since season , but chose to introduce Thatcher's other children first; afterward, it never felt like the right time until Cristina left, creating a hole in Meredith's life. This also led Shonda to claim that there have been indirect references to Maggie over the course of the series. This is especially evident in [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season ]] as [[Only Mama Knows]] features numerous flashbacks from that season.\n*According to her mother, she started reading at the age of two.\n*There's nothing Maggie doesn't eat.\n*Growing up, Maggie was bullied because she was younger and smaller than the other kids, and because of her lisp.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n*On Twitter, Shonda Rhimes revealed she thought a lot about making Ellis and Richard's love child a son.

They wore masks and ate outside and tried to stay distanced, but Veronica gave her mother a hug, which unknowingly transmitted COVID- to her. Veronica had a mild case, but her mother quickly ended up in the hospital with difficulty breathing. Marcella's condition declined, so they called her daughter to see what she wanted them to do, as Marcella had no healthcare directive, but learned Veronica was also at the hospital, as her own breathing had worsened. Veronica begged the doctors to focus on saving her mother while Marcella said to focus on saving her daughter. Soon after, both of them were in the position to need ventilators, but only one was available. As Veronica had the better chance of survival, she was put on the ventilator while Marcella was bagged.

When Alex refused to explore other, more radical options, she fired him from her case.\n\nAfter firing Alex, she went to Callie and Maggie directly, asking them for other choices. They determined that they could remove her cancer and then replace her ribs and sternum with a D printed version made specifically for her body. Maya accepted the plan despite the risks. Her mother was initially worried, but signed the consent when Maya asked her to.\n\nBefore her surgery, Alex came to hold her hand. Once in the OR, she started to get worried and told Alex she didn't want to die. He told her she wouldn't, but she made him promise to tell her mom there was an envelope under her bed with bank statements and the deed to their house and to keep her mother company while she was in surgery if he could.\n\nAs they went to place the new ribs, they found that it didn't quite fit, despite being custom-made. In order to finish the procedure, they decided to pull on Maya's ribs to separate them and give them the room they needed to place the new ribs. It was successful and Maya was stable and awake after her surgery.\n\n\n\nMaya was raised by a single mother who was young when she was born. Maya took charge in her own medical care because her mother never really understood anything about it and said Maya had a mind for it.\n\n\n*She was  at the time of her second resection.\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roberts, Maya}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

The CT showed that the tumor was back, meaning she needed to have awake brain surgery so they could monitor her function as they worked. While in surgery, she was able to sing, her passion, but wasn't able to speak normally when the edge of the tumor was stimulated, meaning she'd lose her ability to speak if they operated. They told Peg\uaabout this and she challenged them to go back to their research and find another option, because Kimmie faced everything with a smile and they should do better for her. They had an idea to use frequency waves to treat shatter her tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue, but while they developed the technology, she had to have more radiation and chemotherapy to treat the cancer. Even though she knew she'd be bald by fall with chemotherapy and radiation, she kept a smile on her face, despite wanting to be able to audition for a musical and beat out Susie Oppenheimer. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nThe doctors continued their research to look for a cure for Kimmie as she continued to deteriorate.

Kimmie didn't want that, so she asked for medical marijuana in the form of oil instead. She said it had been Peg's idea. Alex got the paperwork filled out to get the use approved, but when he went to Peg about it, she was against it, because both Kimmie's parents had been addicted. She fired Alex and decided she wanted to move Kimmie to another hospital for treatment. However, Alex went to her personally and explained to her the benefits of using medical marijuana over conventional medicine. She agreed and Kimmie was given the oil, which greatly helped her nausea.

After treating [[Noah Brosniak|Noah]] with the laser treatment, Tom and Amelia decided Kimmie couldn't wait for it to be honed to work for her type of tumor and decided to develop a treatment plan that would allow her to live until summer, when Tom would take her and Peg to New York and see as many Broadway shows as they could before she died. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\nAfter Kimmie tired of waiting for a cure, she decided she wanted to go to New York and sing in the street on Broadway and live the rest of her life outside the hospital.

After completing medical school, he was matched to Grey Sloan Memorial. On his first day, Koracick assigned him to scut despite his experience practicing medicine.\n\nHe was later tested for COVID, along with the rest of the hospital staff. At the end of the day, Reza, along with Sara and Alma Ortiz, was taken into the OR by Richard Webber, who modified his traditional intern speech to fit the pandemic, promising them to teach them as much as they could and assuring them they'd get through it together. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nWhile assisting Jo while she operated on [[Val Ashton]], Reza used his surgical skill to anticipate her moves. He explained how he came to the US to escape religious persecution and bombings and felt having to repeat his training was a small price to pay. He cheerfully followed Jo's orders, explaining to her that his mother taught him that every day above ground was a good day. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nHe continued working with Jo on Val's case as Val's condition worsened. Finally, two days after Val's surgery, she had to go on liver dialysis when her remaining liver began failing. Later, she coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Levi found himself unable to work on Andrew's surgery for fear of being too distracted to be a good doctor, he asked Reza to step in for him. Reza assisted Teddy as she worked on Andrew's heart. They were able to repair the damage and Andrew was stable and awake in the ICU afterward. However, Andrew coded again later that night and had to be taken back into surgery. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to save Andrew and Reza called time of death. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n\nReza worked on the case of [[Arthur Beaton]], a toddler who was born with multiple ventricular septal defects. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, she cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, Reza was able to get his first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total,  patients were treated using this method. Reza assisted Levi with two of them, as Levi finished the first one earlier than anticipated and another patient had come in through the ER. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nAround Christmas, Reza scrubbed in with Winston for [[Farouk Shami Hunt|Farouk Hunt's]] heart transplant. They awaited the arrival of the donor heart, unaware that the car transporting it had been involved in a serious accident. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nThe heart arrived despite the accident and Winston examined it and found it to be bruised, likely from the crash. Despite this, the transplant went forward and Farouk survived the surgery. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe learned a sense of optimism from his mother, who said that every day above ground is a good day.

Cristina took her to the OR for a biopsy, which revealed that she was rejecting her donor heart. They treated it with anti-rejection medication and put Ivy back on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well.

She, too, was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. The doctors inserted a pacemaker.

''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nWhile playing Hide and Seek with [[Braden Morris]], Frankie collapsed in a hallway. When she was found, her pulse was weak and she wasn't breathing well. She was taken into surgery to insert an LVAD and then she was put on the transplant list.

One became available, but when they transplanted it, they discovered that it had been damaged during retrieval and couldn't keep her alive. When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow.

They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin.

The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up.

When she was faced with deportation to El Salvador, she moved to Switzerland to work at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]].\n\n\n\nSam was born in El Salvador. A war broke out and her father was shot on their front porch, after which her mother took Sam and her sister out of the country. They moved to Florida and her mother worked  jobs  hours a day to keep them safe. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\nSam came to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for an interview to be considered for an internship. In her interview, she said she'd read all about the fire and [[Stephanie Edwards]] was her hero. She didn't realize they'd already done the remodel of the hospital. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nSam attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. In the hallway, Sam was shocked to see Andrew and learn that he worked there. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a roller coaster derailed at a fair, Sam came to Ben because she needed supplies for a burn patient in the clinic. He had Andrew show her where central supply was, not knowing their history. They ended up having sex in the skills lab and were caught by Bailey and Webber. He later came into the on-call room where she was resting and despite them agreeing that they were bad for each other, they had sex again. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the heart monitors started malfunctioning in the ER, Sam stepped in to defibrillate, not knowing the patient was simply sleeping. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nSuffering from a lack of sleep, Sam then started to cause patients to panic in the ER. Richard told Andrew to stay with her and supervise her. Andrew ended up telling her not to talk to anymore patients until she got some sleep. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nAfter overhearing Amelia ask Andrew to figure out which of the new interns had written a paper on pupillary response in comatose patients, Sam told Amelia it was her and was invited to join her team, along with Andrew. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nSam and Andrew both continued working on Team Shepherd, torturing both of them, as they had agreed they shouldn't have sex anymore. Despite this, they tortured each other as they worked, each of them turning the other on. They did this while they worked on a proposal for a surgical innovation to save [[Kimmie Park]]. Their proposal, under Alex and Amelia, was submitted for consideration for the surgical contest, but was not selected. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nDespite not getting the funding, they continued to work hard to figure out a way to save Kimmie. Amelia brought in [[Tom Koracick]] to help them and they tested over and over again, but had no success. Koracick wanted to give up trying to find a solution in time for Kimmie, but during a fight, he had an epiphany and they tried another method, which had greater success. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\nThey use the guided laser treatment on Noah and it worked, but also showed them they didn't have enough time to hone the procedure to work for Kimmie. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Andrew was concussed in the ER, Sam worried about him. When Amelia caught wind of this, she encouraged Sam to tell Andrew she was in love with him. Sam went to Andrew, but Andrew stopped her and said they were young before, but now they're not and they confessed their mutual love. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\n\nWhen ICE agent [[Martin Fields]] came to the hospital looking for Sam, they hid her in an OR and worked on a plan to keep her from being deported back to El Salvador, where she had never been since her family left. They toyed with having her flee, but fleeing would make her a criminal and not let her practice medicine ever again, so they dismissed that chance. Pressed for time, Meredith contacted [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] and got Sam a job at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] working for her and gave Sam all the documentation she needed to show that she had plans to leave the country, including an essay she'd written as part of her application to work there. Then she got a cab from the hospital to the airport. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nShe and Andrew had a relationship in the past. Realizing they weren't good for one another, things ended badly. As she refused to answer his calls, he kidnapped her dog and she then broke into his apartment to retrieve it. He then moved across the country without saying goodbye to her, leading to her blocking him on social media. They hadn't seen each since then until they bumped into one another at Grey Sloan Memorial, where Sam had just started her residency.\n\nHe initially ignored her because they always wreck each other and because he thought she followed him to Seattle, but she made it clear it was pure coincidence. After ending up in the same on-call room, they ignored the toxicity of their relationship and ended up having sex, something they continued to do every chance they got.\n\nAfter Andrew was injured in the ER, he and Sam confessed their love to each other and agreed to start again. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nWhen she learned that Andrew was living in an on-call room, she asked him to come live with her. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\nAfter an ICE agent came looking for Sam at the hospital, she was forced to move to Switzerland to avoid deportation back to El Salvador, where she was born. As she got ready to leave for the airport, Andrew said he'd come with her as soon as he could, but she ended things between them and told him not to ruin his life because she was forced to leave. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\nHer mother brought her and her sister to the United States from El Salvador when she was one after her father was shot to death on their front porch.

They arrived on the first day and were welcomed reluctantly by [[Tom Koracick]]. He gave them assignments and then left tape and a marker to make name tags for themselves.\n\nLater, while waiting in line to be tested for Covid-, Sara was told she was wearing her PPE incorrectly and had [[Mabel Tseng]] teach her the proper way to don and doff it.\n\nAt the end of the day, Richard took her, plus her mother and [[Reza Khan]], into an OR where he modified his traditional intern speech to fit the pandemic. He promised them he'd help them learn as much as they could and said they'd get through it together. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nSara struggled to adapt to the requirements of her new job, accidentally ordering a pregnancy test for a male patient while using the computer. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\nLater, Sara helped treat [[Marcella Diaz]], who had COVID- that was worsening. When she declined to the point where she needed a ventilator, Sara helped intubate her only to find there was only one ventilator available and her daughter also needed it. After some dispute over who would get the ventilator, Maggie found a way to split the ventilator power so both of them could use a single machine. Sara and her mother, Alma, were left to supervise them after they were ventilated and Alma comforted her daughter. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nSara was tasked with repeatedly calling Winston after he was pulled over on his way to Seattle and the police officer forced him to hang up his phone. She called him continuously until Maggie took her phone back. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\nSara worked with Amelia on [[Skyler Nichols]], who had been in a car accident. She took a phone to Skyler's father so Amelia could update him on her condition and sat in with Amelia as she did MRIs on Skyler when she didn't wake up for several weeks after her surgery. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, she cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, Sara was able to get her first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Brad DiMarco]] came to the ER with a massive facial injury from a firework, [[Tara Brown]] accompanied him. When she banged on the window of the trauma room and frantically begged the doctors to save him, Sara went out to deal with her. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nSara worked on the case of [[Rashida Flowers]], a social media influencer who had chronic kidney failure and needed a new port to receive dialysis. While working on her, Sara learned that Black patients are subjected to a multiplier when their kidney function is assessed based on assumptions about Black bodies, which made Rashida ineligible for a transplant while a white patient with the same numbers would be eligible. When her last access port failed, Winston insisted that she be placed on the transplant list. Finally, when Rashida woke up, he and Sara were able to tell her she was on the list. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nLater, after Rashida received a kidney, Sara said her numbers all looked good. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nThe residents enjoyed this new teaching method and eagerly awaited each day.

Four years later, he was undergoing chemoradiation to treat mets in his lungs. His wife found him struggling to breathe in the nursery trying to assemble a crib. They admitted him and ordered a CT, which showed a mass in his ileum that was obstruction his bowel, likely the cause of his pain. Jo operated with the hope of resecting the tumor and reducing his pain, which would buy him more time, as his wife was  weeks pregnant and he was desperate to live long enough to meet his son. However, when they opened, Jo found that the tumor was too invasive, so instead of removing the tumor, she performed an ileostomy to make him more comfortable and buy him a little more time. After his surgery, Jo told Kristen that he had a month at most to live. Kristen asked them to do a c-section immediately so he could meet his son, but Jo said it wasn't safe because she was too early. Link said he'd check with [[Carina DeLuca]], giving Kristen hope, but Carina also said no. Kristen then went to Simon and told him he needed to live to meet his son. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, he started chemotherapy treatments to try to buy him enough time to meet his child. While he was getting treatment, he and Kristen did puzzles to pass the time. [[Catherine Fox]] got her treatments at the same time as his and they talked as well. When Kristen began having contractions and needed to go upstairs to be examined, Catherine sent Richard up with her so she wouldn't have to go alone since Simon couldn't go with her. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\nSimon continued receiving supportive care as Kristen's pregnancy continued into the final weeks. When he struggled to breathe, he asked them not to intubate him, fearing the tube would never come out, but desperate for Simon to meet their son, Kristen authorized it. A CT showed that his mets had grown and he had new ones. Kristen then made the decision to have the doctors put Simon on ECMO to buy him a little more time, even though they warned her she might later have to decide to turn off the machines. While Simon was being connected to the machines, Link brought her food and assured her she wasn't being selfish trying to get Simon to live long enough to meet their son. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\nSimon was stable on ECMO when Kristen suffered a placental abruption and had to be rushed into an emergency c-section. While he was in surgery, he learned that Kristen needed the blood that had been brought for him and he said to send it to her so that she and their child would be saved. After their son was delivered, Winston brought him to Simon, who kissed him and told him hello forever before dying.

However, he also had a bump on his forehead which he thought was a zit but was actually a Pott's Puffy Tumor. He was taken in to surgery to have it drained. In surgery, the doctors noted cerebral spinal fluid, meaning that the abscess had penetrated his brain, meaning they needed to call in Dr. Shepherd. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\n\nAfter surgery, Braden was put into an isolation room because the enzyme injections had stopped working, leaving him vulnerable to infection. He woke up and was scared when he saw where he was. His parents assured him through the plastic barrier that they weren\ut leaving him and they love him. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-up, Braden's infection had cleared up. However, his T-cell count was still zero, so he had to remain in isolation. He used a remote control car to break through the plastic and escape to play tag, but he was quickly found and taken back into isolation. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]] had the idea to use deactivated HIV to deliver the enzyme to Braden's body. His parents were initially concerned about the use of HIV, but Dr. Bailey assured them that she was not going to give Braden HIV.

They also decided the press charges against Bailey for assault and battery. Owen and Jackson were able to assure them that the results were as she said they were, but not to drop the charges.\n\nStephanie Edwards lied and told them that she had forgotten to tell Bailey that they had withdrawn consent and it was entirely her fault.

He was [[Chief of Staff|Chief Medical Officer]] of the Foundation before being replaced by [[Richard Webber]]. He was [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], where he trained [[Amelia Shepherd]] in the field. In Seattle, he developed a relationship with [[Teddy Altman]] until she chose Owen after having his baby, though the two later developed a short-lived affair.\n\n\n\nAt some point in his life, Tom got married to Dana and had a son named David with her. When David was  years old, he died when he got hit in the head with a baseball bat.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref> David's death happened two weeks before Halloween, which was David's favorite holiday and Tom and David's thing. They had prepared a Luke Skywalker\uacostume to go trick-or-treating that year. David never got a chance to wear it and the costume hung on the his bedroom door for months as Tom couldn't bring himself to take it down. His son's death left him hating Halloween.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nAfter David's death, Tom went numb and sleep-walked through years of his life. Eventually, he crossed paths with [[Catherine Fox]] and she finally woke him up again and reminded him what it was like to be alive. They performed sacral nerve implantations so often that they came up with a routine of singing \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\". Over time, they ended up having sex though they never were romantically involved beyond that.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nTom was Amelia's mentor at Johns Hopkins Hospital.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nHe met [[Derek Shepherd]] on the conference circuit. Derek was not a fan of Tom's as he told him it was appropriate that his name had \"ass\" smack in the middle of it.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter learning she had a large brain tumor, Amelia called Tom, her former mentor, to come to Seattle to operate on her. After he arrived, he agreed to operate and also made it clear that Amelia wouldn't be allowed to treat patients until he cleared her, as the tumor was affecting her judgment.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref> Amelia's surgery went smoothly and a few days afterward, Koracick cleared Amelia to go home.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Amelia attempted surgery on her first day back, she asked Tom to scrub in, unsure she could handle it herself. He scrubbed in, but she was able to remove the tumor easily without his help. After the surgery, he admitted he'd hoped she'd fail because that would mean she's not better than him anymore. After their shared success, they had sex in an on-call room.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia called Koracick back to Seattle again to help with researching a technique to remove Kimmie's tumor. After seeing Kimmie and her scans, Koracick believed it was pointless to try to perfect it within such a deadline and wanted to quit, but during a fight with Amelia over the issue, he had an epiphany and discussed a possible solution with Amelia. They later tested it and while it didn't work perfectly, it had more success than their prior attempts, giving them hope.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nTom came to the game night Maggie organized so Amelia and Meredith could meet [[Clive Johnson|Clive]]. He played as April's partner and had a good time. When the night abruptly ended, Tom ended up driving an intoxicated April home.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nAfter waking up from their one-night stand, Tom stuck around at her place and tried to figure out why she was so different from the woman Amelia had chosen for her Power of Attorney during her surgery. He eventually figured out that it was a crisis of faith and talked to her about his own faith, which was tested when his son died in a freak accident involving a baseball bat to the head at age ten. His marriage fell apart after the death of their son and his priest recommended talking to God. Since he didn't want to talk to God, he decided to go to Mass and speak to his son instead, something he told April he still does.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nAfter [[Noah Brosniak]] was diagnosed with an HH tumor, Tom and Amelia decided to use the treatment they were developing for Kimmie to help him. They had to control the lasers very carefully to make sure they were destroying the tumor but not his brain. The procedure was successful and Noah lived, but the difficulty made them realize it would take more time than Kimmie had left to fine-tune it to work for her type of tumor. Therefore, they decided to develop a treatment plan that would allow Kimmie to live until summer when Koracick planned to take vacation time and fly Peg and Kimmie to New York to see as many Broadway shows as possible before she died. Alex became angry when he learned of this plan and shoved Tom up against a cabinet before backing off.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs Tom and Amelia continued their research into using the laser treatments to remove tumors, he spent time in Seattle more frequently. After Meredith turned down his flirtations, Tom caught a first glimpse of Teddy when he witnessed an awkward interaction between her, Amelia, and Owen on the elevator. While working on their research, Amelia began listing reasons for her to be appointed interim Chief over Teddy. Tom picked up on the jealousy shining through in her comments on Teddy's history with Owen and pointed out Amelia didn't need to pretend like she was a victim in her marriage to Owen. She had been an ass to Owen and the sex she had with Tom the day after they separated screamed that she was glad to be rid of Owen. With their research failing spectacularly, Tom took the time to give Amelia some advice. He told her to knock the other player, Teddy, out of the game if she wanted Owen back. Amelia refused to take personal life advice from him. Tom then shared his biggest regret in life was not fighting for his wife when she decided to walk out of their marriage into the bed of another man.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nAs Amelia was pulled into surgeries often, Tom often worked on the project by himself out of boredom. When Link mistook Tom for the new interim Chief, Tom helped him find Alex. Tom then witnessed how Alex swiftly approved Link's request for a new -D printer to make prosthetics without asking for any details. Tom sarcastically commented Alex was very chiefly while he previously thought Bailey had only picked Alex to make herself look better. Over their research, Tom proposed more sex to Amelia, who turned him down as she had turned a new page with Owen. Tom went to the ER to find Alex to get him to approve a requisition before he would be fired. He then took over when [[Vikram Roy|Vik's]] patient with a nosebleed deteriorated quickly due to Vik's incompetence. Tom rushed the patient to the IR suite to embolize the artery and called in Alex for help, but they failed to get vascular access in time and the patient died on the table. Alex dismissed Roy but Tom wanted him to call time of death first. Roy stated this mistake couldn't be put on him as he was an intern and left. Tom then told Alex he was failing at his job.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom and Meredith were both summoned to Los Angeles for a VIP patient. They speculated that it was someone famous. Before their private plane took off, Meredith told him about how she had dabbled in neurosurgery and how that had come to an end. Tom noticed how uncomfortable Meredith was on the plane and she requested he keep talking to keep her distracted. Catherine met the two of them at the new Catherine Fox Medical Center. On their way to the radiology suite, Catherine told them the patient was a -year-old female with crescendo neck and back pain. She showed them the scans and they were in awe of a tumor that had invaded the vascular and nerve domains, which they agreed could not be removed easily. Catherine then revealed that she was the patient. Tom apologized for his bluntness. The tumor required a biopsy and Catherine stated she would not inform Richard or Jackson until they got those results back. She then took them to the IR suite right away. As he performed the biopsy, Tom ordered a worried Meredith not to backseat drive the procedure. Tom told her that she was a Big Gun, like him, spending her days with worst-case scenarios. He told her Big Guns don't worry until there is something to worry about.\n\nAs Catherine started to wake up after the procedure, Tom started singing \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\" to her. He informed her they were still waiting on the results. Meredith wanted to call Richard but Catherine wanted to get a drink first. As they entered the bar and ordered tequila, Catherine asked the two of them to talk her through the next steps if the tumor turned out to be malignant. They tried to dance around the subject but Catherine pointed out that nothing they could say could be worse than what she had been imagining since finding out about the tumor. Tom and Meredith then said there were two options, osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma, with a chondrosarcoma being likely to render her quadriplegic. Tom excused himself to the restroom and returned with the news that the results were in. Catherine requested one last drink before heading back to the hospital. After finding out, Tom and Meredith attended the hospital's ribbon cutting. When Tom commented on Catherine's looks, Meredith asked what was going on between them. He then shared how Catherine had saved him after his son's death. He confided that he was now worried about his friend, who had a grade  chondrosarcoma that he had no idea how to remove without paralyzing her. Catherine came over and told Tom to find away because after surviving her parents' deaths and raising her siblings and building this legacy for herself, she might just survive this tumor, too. Catherine went to call Richard, who didn't answer his phone as he had been arrested.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref> Richard called her back after Meredith bailed him out, but Tom answered her phone. Richard hung up, believing that Catherine was having an affair with him.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nTom returned to Seattle after the windstorm and recruited Amelia's help to figure out a surgical plane for Catherine's tumor. Their plans were disrupted when Owen came to explain to Amelia that he and Teddy had just been fighting as friends, while Amelia stated fighting like that is what couples do. Tom then requested Owen leave so they could focus. Once he was gone, Tom once again expressed interest in Teddy. After a failed VR practice run of multiple approaches, Amelia was paged away for a consult. When she returned, they started arguing over the impossibility of the situation, which attracted Jo to their study room. She shared that there was a brand new way of -D tumor visualisation called ORBEYE. As Jo dug into the case, Tom marvelled over her beauty and miraculous solution. At the end of the day, Tom met Teddy in the attendings' lounge and sat down to eat his fries. He estimated she was about  weeks along, which was spot on. They introduced themselves to one another and Tom fed her fries as she was rubbing her feet.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nWith better visualisation available, Tom and Amelia came up with a plan to remove the tumor. As the day of the surgery drew nearer, they spend every waking moment studying the tumor and preparing. On the morning of the surgery, Teddy came across Tom playing Operations on a bench outside. Teddy was confident that he and Amelia were ready. Tom and Amelia came to Catherine to explain to her and her family their approach. Amelia interfered when Tom's smug demeanor rubbed Jackson the wrong way. On their way to the OR, Amelia and Tom went over the plan again. Tom had to admit he was nervous when even his arrogance was off. He admitted was thinking about how he couldn't lose another person dear to him and how countless men would be left with sexless lives if this surgery were to leave Catherine unable to operate. They then did the superhero pose and entered the OR to meet Catherine. She reminded them to get clear margins and preserve her motor function. Tom and Amelia gave her a private moment with her husband. Jackson then put on \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" and the staff all danced to the song together.\n\nThe first part of the surgery went well, with Tom loudly singing along to the music. The new microscope gave them perfect visualisation. When they came to the part of removing the tumor en bloc, Amelia found that she couldn't get it free. Tom then told her to do a suck and pluck but they found the tumor was too dense. Tom had the music killed and said they needed to go in from the front. Amelia was in disbelief that Tom wanted to flip Catherine with her spine open but she realized they had no other choice. The flip went well but Tom froze as he was now directly facing Catherine's face. Amelia then feigned a problem so they had to switch places, which brought him back. They freed the tumor from the brachial plexus but the electrophysiologist warned them that the signal in one of her arms was lost. Since removing the tumor en bloc was no longer an option, Richard told them to remove the tumor piecemeal and use his PathPen to see if they got it all. They chose to follow that approach. After hours of doing so with still tumor left behind, they were warned that continuing would impair the motor function in her arms. They decided to stop operating and leave some of the tumor behind. Catherine woke up after the surgery with her motor and sensory functions intact. Tom and Amelia then shared that they had to leave some of the tumor behind. Tom and Amelia apologized for that but Catherine was glad to still be alive with no impairment. Tom said she would have to have scans every three months to track the tumor's growth, but Catherine added she could just live her life in between those scans. She thanked her surgeons for giving her her life back. She planned on throwing a party to celebrate this miracle. Afterward, Tom ran into Teddy in the lobby. She congratulated him and noticed that he wasn't in a celebratory mood for not having succeeded at removing the entire tumor. Teddy stressed that he did save her life and her career and invited him to Joe's to buy him a drink. He asked for a rain check because he wanted to smell good when she would spend money on him. She agreed to that and he walked away with a smile.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom was called in to consult on the case of [[Lucille Reid]], who had an aneurysm in her brain. He and Teddy operated together to fix her. They also observed that she had two men doting over her: her husband, [[Marvin]], and her best friend, [[Julian]]. After working on the case, Tom wondered about the analogous situation happening with her and Owen. That night, she went to his hotel room to show him that she was only ever meant to be friends with Owen.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom attended Catherine's party, with Teddy as his guest. At the party, he and Owen butted heads over his relationship with Teddy, which included a planned pre-baby vacation to Palm Springs. Owen confronted him about it, but he was unconcerned until Owen said that he's not a father. When he heard that, Tom punched Owen. Teddy corrected Owen that Tom is a father and stopped Owen from punching Tom back. Tom then iced his hand as the party continued until a plastic pan accidentally placed in the oven forced an evacuation of the building.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Owen left a birthing class Teddy had invited Tom to be with Teddy after she experienced some troubling symptoms, Tom realized Owen was trying to shut him out of the experience. He warned Owen that he would fight for Teddy to have the person who loves her and only her.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Teddy decided she wanted to buy a house before the baby was born, Tom helped her look, as he claimed superpowers relating to houses.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter [[Kari Donnelly]] was paralyzed in an accident, Link found a study that involved directly injecting stem cells into the spines of quadriplegic patients in the hopes of regaining the use of their arms. He suggested this treatment for Kari, who agreed to try it. In surgery, Tom injected the stem cells.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nThirteen days after her infusion, Kari still had no mobility in her upper limbs. She had other health issues associated with her paralysis, which weakened her.\n\n\nWith only three weeks left until she was due, Teddy had not purchased a house for them to live in. Tom took up the mantle and found Teddy a house that fulfilled all the requirements she'd set out. He then surprised her with a set of keys, which he admitted were just a prop because he hadn't been able to go pick up the actual house keys.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nTom later purchased a crib for Teddy's baby and said he'd put it together for her.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy went into labor, Tom remained unaware and continued to assemble the baby furniture at her new house. While working, he Skyped in to see [[Kari Donnelly]] move her fingers.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe tried calling Teddy, but she didn't answer. He then figured she had given birth and went to the hospital. He found her in a room with her newborn daughter and a crying [[Leo Hunt]]. He admired the baby for a moment and took Leo off her hands. He knew Teddy had gotten back together with Owen after he rode in on a white horse and made all the right promises. Teddy took all the blame for her decision and told Tom he was wonderful. Tom knew that and stated it wouldn't last and that she'd come to regret her decision. He told her he would be there for her when it ended because he loved her, and in the meantime, they would remain friends. He then brought Leo back to daycare so she could rest. A week later, Tom had a meeting with Catherine and accepted her offer to become Chief Medical Officer of her Foundation, meaning he would get to oversee all Chiefs of Surgery of her Foundation's medical centers.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nTom arranged to permanently move to [[Seattle]] and he asked his prot\ueg\ue resident [[Blake Simms]] to move with him. Blake refused as he couldn't leave his grandmother behind. However, Tom wanted him so badly that he paid for Blake's grandmother to move to Seattle with them.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nOn his first day at the job, Tom enjoyed taunting Owen before revealing his promotion to him to put him in an awkward position. He made Owen let him step off the elevator first. While rounding the hospital, he found out Bailey had set up a skills lab for the residents and dismissed teaching, ignoring Jackson's remark that Grey Sloan was a teaching hospital. In the ER, he found that Owen and Maggie were working excessively to resuscitate [[Reid Kim]]. He ordered them to stop but Owen ignored him. Before he could shock Reid's heart again, the rhythm returned suddenly. Owen punted to put the already-charged paddles aside but accidentally shocked Tom in the crotch. Tom fell the floor while squirming in pain. His prot\ueg\ue resident [[Blake Simms]] helped him to a wheelchair and got him [[Catherine Fox]] to treat him. Owen briefly apologized while rushing the patient to the OR but he dropped by Tom's room for a proper apology afterwards. However, in the meanwhile, Tom had obtained an emergency restraining order against him for acute emotional and physical distress. Owen was baffled. Tom directed him to his lawyer for any questions and made him leave.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref> Tom had fun in abusing the restraining order to exert power over Owen by making him leave his trauma room while he examined Owen's patient. Later, he made Owen leave the ER altogether.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith released an expos\ue that trashed Grey Sloan's reputation, Tom quickly came up with a plan to get the hospital free positive publicity. He called [[Dana Martin|Dana]] and [[Peter Martin]] to inform them that [[Jackson Avery]] would operate on [[Clervie Martin|their daughter's]] deformed skull pro bono if they allowed them to film the surgery and use it for promotion. The parents consented since the surgery would otherwise require them to take out a second mortgage. Tom hired a camera crew to document Jackson's miraculous work. Jackson hated the set-up, which only increased as Tom was more concerned with getting proper testimonies as publicity material than putting the parents' concerns at ease. After Tom asked the father to repeat his testimony while filmed from another angle with less backlight, Jackson cut in and told him that the surgery was hard enough on the parents already. Tom reminded him that he was the boss and wondered if he should get Catherine to explain it to him again. However, Jackson went behind his back to have the surgery take place without being documented and had him replaced by Amelia. Tom found out and went to confront him in the OR, where Jackson told him he would call security if the camera crew came near the OR. Tom wanted to pull rank again but Jackson pointed out that he was Foundation, too, owning more shares of the hospital than anyone else, and that his cosmetic procedures provided quite an income for the hospital, so Tom better leave him alone. Tom tried to reason that fires like the one Meredith had started spread rapidly and that it would burn down more than this hospital alone but Jackson didn't budge. Tom realized that they needed good doctors to stay and went to inform Owen that he had gotten rid of the restraining order, but he came too late, as Owen had taken a job at Pac-North. Tom thought he would come to regret that and invited him to call him when that happened. He also reminded Teddy she could still call him if she regretted her choice of picking Owen over him.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nTom put Andrew on his service to get him to make Meredith make things right with the hospital. Meredith herself then turned up with a sick Zola. They did some scans and found that her shunt needed to be revised. Tom flawlessly performed the surgery.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Tom worked on a patient with Teddy and Bailey. While he dismissed Halloween every chance he got, Teddy was stressing out over Owen's apparent hint for her to make costumes for their children. She said they skipped so many steps from friends to a family of four that she didn't feel prepared for the situation, leaving her to feel like she had no idea what she was doing. Tom then said he didn't understand her either and told her not to let Owen make her feel inept as a mother for not making costumes like his mother had done. He finished up his part of the surgery and went back to the ER to save more Halloween casualties. The patient made it through the surgery. Afterwards, Bailey confronted Tom with his incessant complaining about the holiday and he told her that his son's death ruined Halloween for him as it used to be their thing. Hearing the story made a hormonal Bailey sob in front of him, which she had been trying to avoid, and he comforted her.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nTom stayed at the hospital while most of the attendings took the day off to support Meredith on the day of her hearing before the medical commission. He was surprised to find Amelia, Link, and Teddy back soon and learned that they had diagnosed [[Paul Castello]], the man who had killed Derek, with a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. Tom performed a craniotomy and managed to evacuate the hematoma against all odds. However, a sudden rebleed happened and Tom was unable to save Paul.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Tom learned that Teddy was scrubbing in with Maggie on a cardiothoracic surgery after months, he came into the gallery to observe her and complimented her technique. After the patient's heart wouldn't restart, Maggie quit because she had lost faith in her abilities. Tom tried to convince her otherwise but she had made up her mind. Tom then asked Teddy to become his Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery again. She got mad thinking he fired Maggie to give Teddy what she wanted. She told him that she loved Owen and had moved on from Tom. She said he would make some woman or several women very happy but she asked him to stop barking up this particular tree. Tom then said Maggie actually quit and he wanted her to replace her. Tom then pointed out that Owen had a baby with her and hadn't even proposed yet while Tom was ready to marry her today, which made him wonder if she really wanted to close the door on him.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nTom sprung into action when his prot\ueg\ue [[Blake Simms]] sustained a mid-facial fracture when a car crashed into Joe's bar. He insisted on checking the scans for brain bleeds himself and found none. He then checked if Jackson was good to operate after the long night he'd had. Jackson said he didn't need a babysitter and went ahead with the surgery. Tom requested an update on every step. Jackson couldn't help but make a snide remark about using this case to exploit Blake's vulnerability for free publicity. They neglected to provide him with updates so Tom came in furious when they were wrapping up the surgery. Owen then stopped Jackson as he saw a sign of a CSF leak. Tom scrubbed in and found and patched up the leak. Tom called Blake's grandmother and while Jackson showed her to her grandson, Tom thanked Owen for catching the CSF leak and they shook hands. At the end of the day, Tom watched in disdain as Teddy and Owen announced their engagement to the hospital staff.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nBailey took some unexpected personal time off while the injured residents were still out, increasing Tom's workload. On her first day back, he commented on her unexpected leave multiple times. At the end of the day, she told it wasn't just a vacation but instead time to grieve her miscarriage. He sympathized with her, having been through two miscarriages with Dana before they had David. He shared that it is not as easy to get over as people make it seem, as a miscarriage takes away a piece of your heart that can never be replaced. That is why he developed a habit of lighting a candle on the babies' would-be birthdays. Bailey took his advice and found comfort lighting a candle in the chapel.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie met with Tom to ask her for her job back but he was hesitant as he had Teddy already to replace her.<ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref> As Catherine purchased and subsequently closed down Pac-North, she had Tom interview the staff to see who could be transferred to Grey Sloan. Bailey wanted to make some recommendations but Tom refused to hear her out. Tom went to the waiting room and started with Richard. Tom immediately told him that Catherine had already secured his position at Grey Sloan, which angered Richard and made him refuse. He also met with Maggie despite Catherine already having re-hired her, too, just to make sure it wouldn't seem like he was playing favorites. However, he stressed that it was still Teddy's department. Owen grew impatient when Tom started interviewing residents after meeting all the other attendings. When Owen suggested he was playing a game, Tom promised him he would be out in time for his wedding and continued to interview the residents. When he had seen everyone but Owen, Tom took his time consulting with Catherine on the phone. At the end of the day, he found Bailey, Jackson, Richard, Meredith, and Owen waiting for him in the conference room. They told him they were prepared to quit unless he agreed to all of their terms, which he could present to Catherine as his own ideas to save face and ensure that Catherine wouldn't fire him for causing her top doctors to quit. He was forced agree to re-hire Owen and to have the Cardio and Peds departments led by Co-heads.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nAs a blizzard hit Seattle, Teddy learned that Amelia was on leave and asked Tom about it, but he didn't know why, only that it was not about her baby. Later, Tom brought Teddy hot cocoa as she was enjoying the snow out in the ambulance bay. She told him that she was trying to quiet her mind as she had been having this fear for months that Owen was the father of Amelia's baby. She admitted she was afraid that Owen would always be in love with Amelia. Tom assured Teddy that Owen was very much in love with her, even though he would like for it to be different. Teddy told him he was a good man. He opened up and said people didn't seem to like him despite his attempts to get in with people. Teddy told him she didn't dislike him at all. Tom then initiated a snowball fight. That night, Teddy came by his hotel room. As soon as he opened the door, she started kissing him. He let her in and closed the door.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOn his way to VIP patient [[Griffin Ford]], a multimillionaire who was behind a rocket explosion over the city causing severe injuries, Tom overheard Owen and Teddy discussing wedding venues. Tom was surprisingly nice to Owen. Teddy was afraid it would make Owen suspicious. Tom wanted to keep seeing her and discuss what it meant but Teddy said it meant nothing and that she had acted impulsively because she was afraid that Owen could be the father to Amelia's baby. Tom then went to see Griffin, who talked about the bad press the explosion had left him with. He pleaded with Tom to do a thorough examination in order to find a medical reason that could have caused him to make the mistake that led to the crash. Tom recruited Meredith, who was annoyed that Tom had cleared an entire floor for Griffin, causing troubles with admissions in the hospital. She started her exam but left it to Jackson so she could care for her own patient. Jackson couldn't find anything. Griffin then offered Tom a bribe, asking for a fake diagnosis in exchange for a large sum of money that would allow him to do good in the world. Tom consulted with Meredith about what she would do with Griffin's money and how she decided which rules to break. She gave him some ideas and said she just followed her gut in order to improve the world. Tom then decided to accept Griffin's bribe and \"diagnosed\" him with an aneurysm that could have influenced his judgment. At the end of the day, Teddy came to see Tom in his office and apologized to him, saying he deserved better than what she had done. She explained Tom made her feel good and like she was in control. She didn't want to hurt him because he was such a good guy. They then kissed again.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith organized a pro bono surgery day with  surgeries scheduled. Tom increased the pressure by only allowing OR access until  PM. During the day, Teddy pulled him into a supply closet and told him that Owen was not the father to Amelia's baby. However, that didn't change the way that Teddy felt about Tom. She was paged away and Tom went to check on the pro bono surgeries. He found several patients and their loved ones yelling at Meredith for increased waiting times. Tom then agreed to give her more time and pay for the overtime as well. He confessed Griffin Ford gave him some money and Meredith immediately figured out what he had done. He reminded her that she told him to follow his gut to fix the world. Afterward, Tom met up with Teddy in the OR gallery and told her that while he had slept with a lot of women, he drew the line at married women because he had been the guy whose wife had slept with another man. He wanted to make it easy for Teddy so he told her to go home to Owen and spend time with him.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nTom was part of the team of physicians trying to find out what was happening to Richard. Teddy caught up with him at work and he casually suggested she not marry Owen. He then suddenly froze as they were approached by [[Dana Hamilton]] and her son, [[Guthrie Hamilton]], who bore an uncanny resemblance to Tom and Dana's son David. Dana explained that Guthrie had a brain tumor with a spinal met and she didn't know who else to go to. Tom had Guthrie admitted and ordered new scans. Noticing how it made Tom upset, Teddy paged Amelia and informed her about the situation so she could take the case. As Amelia went to introduce herself, Tom used his busy schedule as an excuse. Owen paged Tom for a consult on [[Vera Kitano]], who kept on singing after waking up from her surgery. Tom diagnosed musicophilia and went to check out her scans. Teddy found him in the scan room and an emotional Tom told her that he always thought he could have saved David if he had gotten him to the hospital in time, but now it was like David was there and he couldn't even stand to be in the same room as him, meaning that thought he had been holding onto was a lie. Shortly after beginning the operation, Amelia started to experience contractions. She had Tom paged to take over. He desperately asked her to work through it but she was confident he could do it. Teddy calmed him from the gallery, making him focused enough to diagnose an air embolism. They got it out and Tom finished the surgery successfully. He delivered the happy news to Dana, who apologized for having put him through this. Teddy came by his office to comfort him and apologized for the pain she had caused him. He told her she had taken away more pain than she had caused him. They briefly held hands until she pulled away and left.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nTom and Amelia agreed that Richard was suffering from Alzheimer's, which convinced Catherine to take him home. Later, Owen came to yell at Tom for ignoring his request for time off for the wedding. Tom said he had ignored the e-mail because he didn't think it was urgent based on the subject line, though Owen informed him that they had moved up the wedding to tonight. Tom was surprised but approved Owen's time off. Once he left, Tom called out Teddy for not warning him. He feigned happiness for her. When new symptoms arose, Amelia and Tom performed an EMG, which proved peripheral nerve damage, thus disqualifying the Alzheimer's diagnosis. Tom ran into Teddy again and he brought up the wedding, which he thought she was rushing to convince herself that she could live without Tom. Teddy insisted the wedding would happen, which Tom doubted. Tom then went to see Catherine, who told him she might be asking him to take on a bigger role in the Foundation as she wanted to devote more time to Richard as she was determined not to give up on him a second time. This inspired Tom to page Teddy to his office. He told her not to throw her life away and reminded her that she loved him, too. He insisted he wouldn't give up on her and said he would be waiting for her in his car at  PM, ready to take her wherever she wanted to go. As she started kissing him again, she said she couldn't do that but admitted she loved Tom, too. They proceeded to have sex, during which Teddy told Tom that this was goodbye as she was still going to marry Owen. Unbeknownst to them, they were recorded on a voice mail that Teddy was accidentally leaving Owen.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nThe affair effectively ended while word about the butt dial accident spread around the hospital.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle, Bailey sprung into action to prepare the hospital for the incoming patients while Tom maintained his casual, laid-back attitude. He nonchalantly walked around the hospital with a nine-iron golf club to keep people at a distance when necessary and refused to keep Bailey informed on the order of PPE he had placed. Eventually, the delivery arrived. Tom was joined by a handful of excited doctors, amongst them Teddy, at the loading dock to unpack and distribute the box. However, they soon found that all of the boxes contained booties while there were no masks or other protective gear. Frustated by his mistake, Tom started hitting the boxes with his golf club and broke down on the spot.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nTom heard that Richard made up a system using a UV light cleaning robot to clean masks and other PPE. Afraid of facing Catherine's wrath over his mistake, he tried to convince Richard to let him take the credit for Richard's idea, which Richard refused. He hid from her throughout the day but she paged him and Richard to the conference room at the end of the day. She told Tom that the crisis had proved bigger than him and she would accept his resignation at Chief of Chiefs, in return offering him a position as neurosurgery attending. His ego bruised, Tom claimed he could find a job anywhere he wanted, though Catherine pointed out that word of his sexual escapades had gotten around. He then accepted her proposition.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nRichard replaced him as Chief Medical Officer. Tom joined Owen and Jackson in the lounge as they were watching his speech announcing mandatory COVID tests for all hospital staff. He joked Richard was doing better than his last on screen performance, to which Owen reacted by throwing him out of the room. Richard helped Owen set up drive-through testing, which Tom had been putting off for weeks. Richard tasked Tom with introducing the new interns to the hospital's workings during the pandemic, but he only handed out assignments and told them to find someone else for questions. Due to his lacking guidance, [[James Chee]] failed to finish progress notes in time so Tom had to help him out. Later, while waiting in line for his COVID test, Tom overheard Owen instructing [[Mabel Tseng]] to show [[Sara Ortiz]] how to properly put on her PPE, which Owen said \"someone else\" should have shown her earlier. Tom took the hint. After clashing over a patient discharge with [[Alma Ortiz]], who told him half of her class had quit, Tom went to Richard's office. Citing the disasters with the interns quitting or failing at their jobs, he told Richard he wasn't a natural teacher like him. As he prepared to go home, Teddy joined him in the lounge and asked him to let her buy him coffee to apologize for the lack of contact between them these last few months. He asked her to leave him alone so he could get over her, because she had broken him and he had had enough hurt for a lifetime. To make matters worse, Owen came in to inform Tom that his COVID test had come back positive, meaning he had to go straight home and quarantine for  days.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nFrom home and still asymptomatic, Tom virtually attended an attendings' meeting. As he demanded a new test, Jackson flipped over the tablet to shut him out. Taryn delivered the test to his house. Not allowing residents in his home, he had her wait outside while he did the test on himself. Through the window, she noticed he had created an algorithm predicting the global spread of COVID- by adapting the algorithm for a zombie apocalypse game. The test came back positive. He demanded another one but his request was denied. His mood had taken a turn for the worst since his simulation had shown they would all die within a year. In the evening, Teddy showed up with soup to cheer him up, but he ignored her as he sat on the floor sweating and shaking, finally symptomatic and forced to face the reality of his diagnosis.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Tom is admitted to Grey Sloan.]]\nAs his symptoms rapidly worsened, he was taken to the hospital, where he seized upon arrival. He was in a postictal confused state as Teddy started the work-up in the ER. Amelia consulted on the case, coming out of her maternity leave. The exam showed no neurological deficits and she guessed the confusion had to be attributed to hypoxemia or possible early sepsis. She later did another EEG to exclude another seizure while his numbers remained stable. Teddy remained in the room afterward and said she hoped he had been too sick to answer the door, because that meant that there was hope for them, that their relationship or friendship could be salvaged despite the hurt she had caused him. She said they couldn't go through it alone and if he wanted her gone, he had to wake up and tell her to leave. He then opened his eyes and told her he had in fact ignored her. Glad to see him awake again, she jokingly told him she hated him. He stated they both knew that wasn't true and then asked for a sponge bath.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nHis condition improved though he suffered mentally from having people die around him. The confrontation with his mortality had made him nicer to the point where he talked to Maggie without using diminishing nicknames. He told her he had put his hopes on beating the virus himself on Meredith pulling through, so he was delighted to hear that Meredith was awake, too. He got some rest but woke up to Maggie failing to resuscitate his roommate. Tom got emotional and asked for the man's full name so he could properly pray for his family, whom he had heard during the numerous video calls. To cheer him up, Maggie informed him that Meredith was still stable. Tom then bribed a nurse to wheel him to Meredith's room. Inside, he told her he wanted to see that it was possible to beat this thing. As he said he wanted to be in a room where no one was dying, he broke down. She reached out and held his hand. As they had a friendly conversation, another patient down the hall died. Tom opened up and told Meredith that all he had in life was work and a long list of women he had slept with. She told him she had more. As they talked about kids, a nurse discovered Tom in the room and took him back to his own room while judging him for breaking protocol.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after, a somber Teddy came to inform him that Meredith's health had declined and they intubated her. She came to tell him in person because she wanted to be with someone who didn't hate her. Tom said he didn't hate her but he wanted her to hear from her sometime soon that she never loved him. She went back to work without doing so, but returned after operating on [[Andrew DeLuca]]. She commented that Tom's oxygen saturation had gone up, a good sign. She then told she did love him. She tried not to because she also loved Owen. She thought she could love them both but ended up tearing everything down to the ground. Tom pointed out that empirical evidence showed that she did not love them both, even though she may have convinced herself otherwise. He said he was still there while Owen did not want her anymore. If she actually loved him, they would be together and she wouldn't be so miserable. He needed for her to admit that so he could get up off the ground where she dropped him, if he were to survive COVID-. She then tearfully admitted she never loved him. He thanked her for giving him what he needed.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\nWith his health spectacularly improving, he attended Andrew's memorial service and was  discharged not long after.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref> He returned to work soon and hovered around the COVID ICU to keep an eye on Meredith. He heard about the ventilator shortage in the hospital and warned Owen, who had taken over Meredith's from Teddy, not to take her off the ventilator too soon or else she might not have one available if her sats were to decline again. Owen made it clear he was aware of that. Tom later overheard how the ventilator shortage forced the hospital to close its doors for trauma. Owen found Tom hovering outside Meredith's room and told him they would soon take her off the vent as she was consistently breathing over it. Tom said he would hate it if someone like him got to survive and someone like Meredith wouldn't make it. All too familiar with survivor's guilt from Iraq, Owen softened up and said that that feeling he was something he wouldn't wish on anyone, not even Tom.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\nHis first case back was [[Karissa Skolaski]], who had been in a car accident and had asked the first responder to save her first rather than her husband. Tom took her for a head CT, which showed no lesions that her selfish outburst could be blamed on. He had her admitted overnight for observation.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith failed to wake up with no plausible cause, Teddy took her for a head CT. Tom showed up in the CT boot as they waited for the results. A worried Teddy rambled on about the serious long-term effects. She then remembered that was a reality Tom was facing and apologized for her inconsiderately bringing it up. He brushed it off and said she was merely stating facts. Tom consulted on [[Felix Pelgado]], a patient of Link's that Amelia had brought in. Amelia took the case and as she operated on the meningioma, Tom and Link watched her from the gallery. Tom said he enjoyed watching Amelia's elegance and focus. Link brought up Meredith. Tom stated he had decided to avoid the entire COVID wing. They both wanted to scream at God for the miserable reality they had to live through.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom puts up a tough exterior at work and he is not shy from praising his own skills, both of which contribute to other people generally disliking him. However, Tom is funny and actually an emotional person as confirmed by [[Lorraine Simms]]. As such, he knows when to let go of his tough facade and show his true colors to people who are in need of comfort, like when he helped [[April Kepner]] acknowledge her crisis of faith or when [[Miranda Bailey]] needed some comfort after suffering a miscarriage. The loss of his son David rendered him with a notable soft spot for children as evidenced by his excellent bedside manner with [[Kimmie Park]] and the lengths he went to to make her final weeks perfect for her.\n\n\n\n[[Dana Hamilton]]\nHe was previously married to Dana. They had two miscarriages before their son David was born. Unfortunately, David died at the age of  due to a baseball accident. Tom and Dana's marriage fell apart and they divorced after their son David\uadied.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\uaTom mentioned to Teddy once that he knew what it was like to be cheated on, making it likely that Dana cheated on him as their marriage unraveled.\n\n [[Amelia Shepherd]] \nAfter Amelia's first surgery when she had recovered from her tumor, she had sex with him, where he also admitted she was a better surgeon than him.\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nHe had sex with April after they met at Maggie's game night. The morning after, he helped her with her crisis of faith and shared how he dealt with his son's death.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nicole Herman]]\nHe and Nicole had sex after she became blind.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nAfter learning that Teddy was pregnant with Owen's baby, but they weren't a couple, Tom expressed interest. When he later found Teddy in a lounge massaging her feet, he offered her some of his fries and fed them to her because her hands were covered in feet.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he operated on Catherine, Teddy offered to celebrate with a drink, but he took a rain check, saying he needed a shower.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Tom and Teddy at Catherine's party.]]At Jo and Alex's New Year's Eve party, Tom and Teddy shared a kiss at midnight. Later, he saw her lying down because her feet were hurting and said she should go get a mani-pedi at his favorite place. They ended up getting mani-pedis together, which they both enjoyed.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nTheir relationship hit a small snag when Tom wondered about her relationship with Owen. However, she allayed his fears and he invited her into his hotel room to have dinner.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy was working on the difficult case of [[Elizabeth Hall]], Tom was back at Hopkins. However, he came back and saw her being comforted by Owen.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nLater after having a snowball fight and hot cocoa, she came to his hotel room and they kissed and he shut the door.\n\n\nHis son David died at the age of ten when he was hit in the head with a baseball bat.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref> Tom always felt incredibly guilty over his death, always assuming he could have saved his son had they gotten to the hospital in time.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nAfter operating on Catherine, he went to the chapel to talk to his son and tell him his dad did well.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Catherine Fox]]\nHe has a history with [[Catherine Fox]]. They flirted a little bit when they ran into each other again at the hospital and she invited him to return for lectures in the future.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nTom later told Meredith that Catherine was the one who woke him back up after his son died, reminding him that he was still alive and shouldn't sleepwalk through his life.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAs her mentor, Amelia has professional respect for him, though she acknowledges and loathes his arrogance. He likes to take credit for her surgical skills. After her tumor was removed, he stayed to cover her service until she was cleared to return. However, she stopped him from leaving and asked him to join her on her first case back as she needed some hand-holding.\n\nAfter they operated together, he had sex with her after he told her she was a better surgeon than him. He later claimed he only said that to get her to sleep with him, though she didn't buy that. She also told him she dislikes him intensely.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nWhile they worked on their research together, Tom gave Amelia advice on how to get where she wanted to be with Owen.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\n\nDr. Koracick was the [[Attending#Department Head|head]] [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. He trained [[Amelia Shepherd]]. He helped to cover her service at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] while they planned to remove her tumor and stayed to do so until she was cleared to return to work. He later partnered with her on her innovation project regarding ultrasound ablation of inoperable gliomas and gained privileges at Grey Sloan to jump in and help out when necessary.\n\nCatherine appointed Tom Chief Medical Officer at the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]], meaning he was the Chief to all the Chiefs of Surgery at the Catherine Fox Medical Centers, [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] included. He then presumably quit his position at Johns Hopkins to spend his time at Grey Sloan, the best hospital of the Foundation. After he messed up a critical order of PPE during the COVID- pandemic, Catherine fired him and offered him an [[attending]] [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] position, which he accepted.\n\nAfter that, [[Richard Webber]], the new Chief Medical Officer, gave him his [[Resident#Program Director|Director of the Residency Program]] position at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\n*He plays music and sings along while operating.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*His Grey Sloan Memorial lab coat has Tom Koracick embroidered on it, while the lab coats usually display the\uadoctors' full first names.\n*He grew up Catholic.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n*He likes to play Operation before surgery to get himself in the mood.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxThomasKoracick.png\nxThomasKoracick.png\nxThomasKoracick.png\nxThomasKoracick.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThe following episodes are Tom-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life:\n*[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\n*[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\n*[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\n*[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]]\n*[[Sing It Again]]\n\n\n\n\n{{Tom Koracick Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Tom Koracick]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Koracick, Tom}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She had surgery to repair the fractures, but when she woke up afterward, she believed everyone else was singing when they weren't and believed she was talking when she was actually singing all her words. They got a neuro consult and she had an MRI, which showed no signs of a stroke or bleed. They decided to keep her overnight to monitor her and see if it was a side-effect of the anesthesia. Later that day, she developed a tension pneumothorax. They were able to relieve the pressure and she stabilized, but Herschel realized he just wanted her to be safe and sung to her that he loved her.\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Herschel Kitano]].\n\n\nShe is a professor at the University of Washington like her husband.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kitano, Vera}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Veronica had a mild case, but her mother quickly ended up in the hospital with difficulty breathing. Marcella's condition declined, so they called her daughter to see what she wanted them to do, as Marcella had no healthcare directive, but learned Veronica was also at the hospital, as her own breathing had worsened. Veronica begged the doctors to focus on saving her mother while Marcella said to focus on saving her daughter. Soon after, both of them were in the position to need ventilators, but only one was available. As Veronica had the better chance of survival, she was put on the ventilator while Marcella was bagged.

Winston did so and Wendell and his friend climbed into the car and told Winston to drive away quickly. Not long after that, Winston was pulled over and there was stolen merchandise in the car. He was arrested and his brother and his friend suffered no consequences. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\n\nWendell came to Grey Sloan and roped [[Karen (Season )|Nurse Karen]] into helping him trick his brother, [[Winston Ndugu|Winston]], by posing as a patient with aortic dissection and then pretending to be dead. Then the two of them, plus Maggie, went to get coffee together. Wendell apologized for missing their wedding, saying he had a job go south and couldn't even afford the bus ticket to Seattle. But he had a new job as a medical sales representative. While Wendell and Maggie went to tend their patients, Wendell went to [[Owen Hunt]], who was acting as chief for the day, and pitched the products he was trying to sell. This upset Winston, who quickly realized that Wendell had used their relationship to land the job and came to Seattle to pitch to the doctors more than to see Winston. Despite this, Winston was able to reconcile his feelings and told Wendell he would introduce Wendell to some of the other doctors. He also told Wendell that while he still believed their mother wouldn't have died if she hadn't had to deal with Wendell and their father, he was trying to get past that. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nWendell did a presentation on the medical device he was attempting to sell, saying it was applied like a patch onto the patient's body and would give a continuous ECG, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, allowing doctors to monitor their patients from anywhere. Maggie said she wanted to test the device, so Wendell gave her some. However, the device didn't work. He took it back and said they got the prototype model and he offered a replacement. Winston noticed that the replacement was identical to them first one and Wendell admitted that he had lied. He was desperate to sell the devices because he had taken out a loan from a loan shark to buy them. He told Winston he either needed to help sell them or pay back the loan. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\n\nWinston put Wendell up in a hotel to get him off his and Maggie's couch. He claimed he was waiting to hear about a job in Boston. On the night of Meredith's party, Wendell showed up expecting to join the party. Winston sent him away, even after he said that his lenders were after him. Wendell sat outside the house for a while before leaving. Eventually, Maggie gave Wendell the money he'd asked for and so did Winston, with each of them unaware that the other had done it. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe has a tense relationship with his brother, Winston. This stems from their mother's illness and death, as Winston believed their mother focused too much of her time and money on Wendell and their father, which led to her death. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")'' His father was physically abusive to both of them. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\n\nHe claimed to be a medical sales representative for Trinity Labs, but in actuality, he'd merely purchased $, worth of their product in the hopes of selling it all for a profit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Wendell Ndugu Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Wendell Ndugu]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ndugu, Wendell}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He is married to [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], whom he trained under in Boston before she moved to Seattle.\n\n\n\nWinston worked under Maggie while he was a resident at Tufts. He had a crush on her from the first day of residency even though she was his chief. The fact that she was younger than him only made him crush harder. He bided his time, but she moved to Seattle in mid-, right before he became an attending, so he never got a chance to ask her out.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nSix years later, for the third time in his life, Winston attended the Surgical Innovation Conference in Los Angeles. He spotted Maggie from across the room during heart valve happy hour and approached her. He admitted he had looked for her at earlier editions of the conference and was glad to have finally seen her there. He then told her about his crush, observed she wasn't wearing a wedding ring, and said he hoped he would finally be able take his shot and ask her out. They soon gave in to their mutual attraction and retreated to her room, where they had sex.\n[[File:x-.jpg|Winston and Maggie reconnect.|thumb]]\nAfterward, they had a walk by the hotel pool. With only  more hours left for the conference, they set out to get to know each other better. They did a lightning round. She described her perfect day to him, which sounded much like a romantic comedy. She then clarified she wanted to spend that day alone because she liked being alone, to a certain degree. He then started to describe his perfect day off, which started with morning sex with Maggie. They kissed again. Maggie then asked him who his favorite person was. He told her about his mother, who had died two years earlier from ovarian cancer. Maggie related because of her own mother's death. Maggie then inquired if having med conference flings was his thing. He admitted he had hooked up at conferences before, but he had never fallen this hard this fast for anyone. Maggie felt the same way.\n\nBack in bed once again, Winston recalled a time he scrubbed in with Maggie on a piggyback transplant. He was so nervous he was afraid he would drop the donor heart on the floor. Maggie told him she felt like that every time she saw him, except in the OR, where she is a hero. She said she was a neurotic mess in real life outside of the OR. Winston said he could not see that, which made her realize how much at ease she was around him. They were surprised by their alarm clocks. They had talked the entire night. As they got ready for the day, Maggie discovered he would be attending [[Richard Webber|Richard]]'s talk on his PATH pen later and she reminded him who Richard was. Winston thought it would be weird for him to meet Richard on what amounted to their first date, but Maggie said the whole thing had been weird. Yet perfect, he added. Instead of getting ready, they ended up making out again.\n[[File:x-.jpg|Winston asks Maggie to move to Boston.|thumb]]\nThey had breakfast separately, but he found her right before Richard's talk. He asked her to move back to Boston with him. He saw how flustered she was, so he offered to move to Seattle. He insisted that you can meet a person and just know they are the right person for you, and that was how he felt about her. After his mother's death, he had embraced \"carpe diem\" as his motto. He and Maggie quoted their second favorite movie, Dead Poet's Society, once again showing how well they matched are. Maggie said she was a person who needed time to weigh and measure pros and cons before making decisions. He happily agreed to give her the time to do so but he said he knew his feelings about her wouldn't change. They then headed in for the talk, where Richard started showing signs of being unwell. Winston watched from the audience as Maggie got on stage to make Richard stop his talk and get him off the stage. Maggie then walked with Richard on a gurney, past Winston, as they left the conference.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing the conference, Winston returned to Boston and Maggie returned to Seattle, but the two continued their relationship long distance. They video chatted frequently, discussing the pandemic, their patients, the ways in which the virus was disproportionately affecting people of color, and shared how their families were doing. Maggie shared stories about her time spent with her nieces, nephews, and sisters and Winston shared stories about his grandmother and his coworkers.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> After Maggie told him a story about how she had a picnic with [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] that turned into a sleepover on the laundry room floor, Winston bought her a tent and had it shipped to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] house in Seattle. He arranged with [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] and [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]] for it to be set up in the backyard as a surprise for Maggie.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith contracted COVID-, Maggie shared her fears with Winston and he comforted her. During this time, Winston invited Maggie to a virtual family dinner for his grandmother's birthday, which Maggie accepted. The dinner was going well until Winston's father joined the call and proceeded to mock and insult Winston and his intelligence. Winston and his father argued as a result, which ended in Winston leaving the call, leaving Maggie to make awkward small talk with his family. Winston later called Maggie to talk about it, telling her that his Dad makes him crazy and that he seems charming, but he has a temper. To make it up to her, Winston arranged for the two of them to watch the movie Coming to America over video chat.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith woke up after being unconscious for eight days, Maggie shared the good news with Winston over FaceTime. Winston told her he was happy to hear that, but ended the call quickly, saying he was in his car at a grocery store parking lot and needed to go buy eggs, leaving Maggie upset and confused. Later that night, Maggie was alone in her hotel room when someone knocked on the door. She opened it to find Winston, who had brought her flowers from the grocery store. He told her that the long distance thing wasn't working for him anymore and they embraced.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nThe following day he and Maggie ordered room service for breakfast and enjoyed the morning together until [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] knocked on their door and told Maggie that she was needed at home. Winston, Maggie, and Jackson went to Meredith\us house and after confirming that they\ud all been tested recently Link invited them in. Maggie went to talk to Amelia about how to tell the kids about Meredith and Winston joined Link and Jackson in the back for beers. Link paced around the backyard holding Scout who he told them would start crying if he stopped moving while talking about Meredith\us worsening condition and the impact her death would have on the kids, Amelia, and his life in general. Realizing what he just said Link felt guilty, but Winston and Jackson reassured him that it was okay and that they all want Meredith to live and not all of the reasons for that have to be selfless. Winston reassured him by telling him that all they can do is keep moving physically and metaphorically. Link commented that Winston was good at reassuring people considering they just met. He then thanked Jackson for getting Maggie to the house even though he knew it was probably awkward and Winston suddenly realized that Jackson was Maggie's ex.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], X</ref>\n\n\nAfter the unexpected death of [[Andrew DeLuca]], Winston comforted Maggie and did his best to support her, Amelia, and Link. While spending time with Meredith's kids, Winston volunteered to take Maggie's place when Zola told her it was her turn to dance with them and she was unable to do so because of her grief. He offered to show the kids some East Coast dance moves and they gladly accepted. Later that day, Maggie gave Winston hospital privileges and they worked together to treat [[Byron Gibbis]], who was admitted after being found passed out on his front porch. After examining him, Winston diagnosed him with endocarditis, but they couldn't figure out the underlying cause until they took him for a CT scan and Winston asked him if he'd had trouble with his teeth. He said he'd picked a popcorn kernel out with his teeth with a paper clip and had sore gums, but had refused to leave his house to go to the dentist. They were about to begin Gibbis's surgery when he got scared and ran out of the OR naked. Winston and Maggie tracked him down with some help from [[Zander Perez]] and Maggie managed to calm him down and convince him to have the surgery. They helped him back to the OR and the surgery went ahead as planned. He later accompanied Maggie to the outdoor memorial that was held for Andrew.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Maggie gave him privileges, Winston continued to work with her to treat COVID patients at the hospital. They spent time together listening to playlists he created by sharing earbuds. Then the time came for him to go back to Boston as the city had experienced another surge and cases were climbing there and he was needed back at Tufts. Maggie didn't want him to go. The two of them sharing ear buds gave Maggie an idea about how to increase ventilator capacity by having patients share a ventilator by splitting the tube in two and filtering the air to avoid contamination. At the end of their shift, Maggie told Winston her job finally felt fun again and that she knew he was needed back in Boston but that she didn't want to be without him. While Maggie tried to ask him to stay, Winston told her he wanted them to listen to one last song before he left and opened his earbud case to reveal a ring. Winston proposed to Maggie and told her she had an out if she wanted one. Maggie accepted his proposal and they kissed.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Maggie accepted his proposal, Winston travelled back to Boston to tie up lose ends. When he was done, he packed up all of his things and drove back to Seattle. He and Maggie texted and video called frequently during this time and he found an apartment that he wanted Maggie to look at. Maggie took a bit to get back to him and when she did she told him she wasn't a fan of the listing. He told her the landlord of the apartment had called previously to inform him he needed a decision today so he told the landlord he would take it as he needed a better option than a hotel or tent in the backyard. He had been driving for three days and had just left a gas station when he was pulled over by the police while he was on the phone with Maggie. Winston assumed a safe position with his hands on the steering wheel and his license and registration in his hand as a sheriff walked up to this window while his partner circled the car with a drug-sniffing dog. Winston asked him why he was pulled over and upon hearing Maggie's worried voice through the phone, the sheriff checking Winston's license demanded that he turn off his phone. Winston cautiously told him his fianc\uee was worried but ultimately complied, fearing for his life. Maggie then attempted to call him multiple times with no response. When Maggie got called back into a trauma when her patient, [[Guy Houston]], went into V-fib again, she handed her phone to intern [[Sara Ortiz]], explained the situation, and told her to keep calling Winston until he picked up.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Guy needed surgery, Maggie paged Richard and explained the situation and that she hadn't been able to reach Winston for the last  minutes. Richard asked for her phone and told her to focus on her patient and that he'd keep calling and if there a wasn't response in a little while, he would go looking for Winston himself. Maggie had just finished moving a catheter into place when Winston called back. Richard let her know and Owen said he'd finish up so that she could talk to Winston. Winston told her he was fine, but that the police made him do a DUI test, had the police dog sniff him and his car, and then unpacked and ransacked all of his stuff, which was now strewn about the side of the road and then had the dog sniff all of that on the grounds that his bike rack was obscuring his license plate. Winston was shaken up and traumatized, but was relieved to have made it out alive. He told Maggie he wasn't good to drive yet and that he needed a moment to catch his breath, so Maggie stayed on the phone with him. Eventually, he got back on the road after talking to Maggie and a couple of hours later arrived at Meredith's house. Maggie and Amelia were waiting on the porch for him. When he arrived, Maggie ran over and embraced him and he told her he thought only about surviving to get back to her. In response, Maggie kissed him.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing his move to Seattle, Winston joined the staff of Grey Sloan Memorial as an attending and worked with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] on Meredith\us case. Her labs showed elevated liver enzymes, so they did a CT of her chest and abdomen. After discovering a clot in her liver Winston declined to do the necessary TIPS procedure because Meredith was his future sister-in-law and said Teddy should do it instead. Teddy prepared to do the procedure herself, but then changed her mind after talking to [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] and had him page Winston to assist. The procedure was successful, but Meredith still wasn\ut able to stay awake, so Winston suggested to Richard that they bring Zola to visit her mom because he thought that hearing and feeling her daughter next to her might help. At first Maggie refused to bring her, but after Zola overheard her talking and said she wanted to go Maggie brought her to the hospital. After putting her in PPE Winston, Maggie, and Richard walked Zola to Meredith\us room and waited outside to see if it would help. At first there was no change, but then Meredith woke up and started talking to Zola. Seeing this Winston celebrated with Maggie, Richard, Amelia, [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]], and Teddy.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\nIn the weeks that followed Winston worked with Maggie, Teddy, Owen, and Link to treat COVID patients. After getting engaged Winston and Maggie asked Richard to officiate their wedding and he gladly accepted saying it would be the honor of his life.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref> Following their engagement, Winston and Maggie began wedding planning. They got into a disagreement when Maggie told him she wanted everything to feel right instead of a compromise and suggested they wait until things open up a bit more. Winston became upset because he thought she was all in and that she was getting cold feet. Three weeks later, Maggie met Winston in the hospital parking lot and told him that none of his ideas were perfect and that she had finally figured out what had been bothering her. She realized that perfect was never going to be an option because her mother wouldn\ut be there and the feeling that something was wrong never had anything to do with him. She just wished her mother could have met him. Winston told her he missed his own mom as well, that his mom taught him how to dance, and would\uve torn up the dance floor at their wedding. Maggie then suggested they take the engagement ring that her mother gave her and turn it into her wedding band and that she didn\ut want to wait to have the wedding. That they should get her dad and his grandmother to Seattle as soon as possible and just do the wedding with family and then have a big party when it's safe to do so. Winston told her he was good with that idea and Maggie said she was relieved before turning towards a parked car and revealing that she had flown her dad [[Bill Pierce|Bill]] and Winston\us grandmother [[Antoinette Ndugu|Antoinette]] out for the wedding. They wanted to hug them, but couldn\ut until they had quarantined for  days. None the less they were delighted to see each other.<ref>[[I'm Still Standing]], x</ref>\n\n\nIn August , Winston and Maggie attempted to get married at a small ceremony in Meredith's backyard with Antoinette, Bill, [[Catherine Fox|Catherine]], Link, and Meredith and her kids in attendance. However, when Richard asked if anyone objected to the union Antoinette and Bill stood up and said that they did because they both thought that the couple deserved a bigger ceremony than this and that it wasn't right to do it this way because Amelia wasn't there, having been called into work at the last minute for an emergent patient, and Maggie had uncles, aunts, and cousins who weren't there. Bill said he had a savings account to do this the right way and that's what they wanted for them. Maggie told them they couldn't do it the proper way because it wasn't safe. Bill suggested that they wait as they were already living together so they couldn't be in that much of a hurry. Winston and Maggie then agreed to postpone the wedding. In April , when it was safe to do so Winston and Maggie got married at the beach with all of their friends and family that they wanted in attendance. They had Meredith walk down the aisle with her kids and spread flower petals at the start of the ceremony then Bill walked Maggie down the aisle. This time no one objected and the wedding went ahead as planned. While Meredith and Teddy had to leave early to perform a lung transplant on one of their patients, everyone else stayed and enjoyed the reception and dancing with Winston and Maggie.<ref>[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter his mother's death, he adapted a \"carpe diem\" mentality. He is a charming and humorous man. He likes to dance and has been shown to be good with kids. \n\n\n\nWinston had a crush on his superior, Maggie Pierce, starting the first day of his residency training under her. He bided his time to ask her out on a date, but she left Boston right before he became an attending. When they met up at a conference after not seeing each other since she moved to Seattle, they hooked up in his hotel room. After spending the night together, he suggested that she move back to Boston or offered to move to Seattle so they could be together. When she said she needed time to make big decisions like that, he said she should take the time she needed and assured her the way he felt wouldn't change.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> Following the conference, Winston returned to Boston and Maggie returned to Seattle, but the two continued their relationship long distance.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> They video chatted frequently, but eventually Winston grew tired of the long distance and came to Seattle to be with Maggie.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref> He later proposed to her and they are now married.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>  \n\n\nHe says his mom was his favorite person in the world. She was his protector. She died of ovarian cancer two years before he reunited with Maggie. While describing his mother's protective side, he mentioned that his mother wouldn't let his father mess with him, indicating they have a strained relationship<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> which was confirmed when Maggie attended a virtual dinner party for his grandmother's birthday and the two argued, resulting in Winston leaving the call early.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref> Winston is very close to his grandmother [[Antoinette Ndugu|Antoinette]].<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe is an attending cardiothoracic surgeon at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].
