She believed he was genuine, but he later bragged to the other Mercy West residents that he had made her his bitch. He later apologized, stating that they could be friends outside the hospital, but not inside. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nCharles donated blood immediately before going to the ER to treat patients from a hotel fire. When he arrived in the ER, he was told to hold an axe imbedded in a patient steady. However, he fainted and pulled the axe out. On his way down, he was hit in the head with the axe and needed stitches. He was later investigated with the other doctors when [[Cathy Becker|a patient]] died under suspicious circumstances. ''(\"[[I Saw What I Saw]]\")''\n\n\nCharles worked on [[Wallace Anderson]] with [[Arizona Robbins]].

''(\"[[New History]]\")''\n\n\nCharles participated in a documentary someone was doing about the doctors at the hospital. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Charles saw Reed flirting with Alex and implying that she'd trade sexual favors for the chance to scrub in, he confronted her about it, but she brushed him off. ''(\"[[Blink]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Derek Shepherd]] became Chief after [[Richard Webber]] was ousted, the Mercy West residents were all worried that he'd fire them because he hated the merger. They also gossiped about why Richard was ousted. ''(\"[[State of Love and Trust]]\")''\n\n\nA motorcyclist came into the ER after crashing. On the way into the hospital, the gurney he was on tipped over, sending him to the ground. Charles worked on his case and was able to preserve enough function to make him an organ donor. ''(\"[[Perfect Little Accident]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were forced to attend sensitivity training, led by [[Miranda Bailey]]. She taught \"Reaction, Observation, Communication\" to improve their interactions with patients whose cases needed more sensitivity. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\nThe sensitivity training was required because they were expecting [[Bobby Corso]], a morbidly obese patient. The residents were told not to make jokes. Charles was kicked off the case when he suggested using a CT scan from the zoo because it would be equipped for animals of his weight. However, he was later brought back onto the case because they needed more big guys for the surgery. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:CharlesDying.jpg|thumb|left|Miranda Bailey holding Charles' hand while he passes away.]]When [[Gary Clark]] came into the hospital intending to shoot [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Richard Webber]], and [[Lexie Grey]], he also shot Charles. Charles was working on the case of [[Mary Portman]]. After the lockdown was announced, he came into Mary's room, telling them that the shooter was on the floor. When Bailey saw Clark shoot a security guard and start heading their way, she told Charles to hide and Mary to play dead. Clark came into the room. After seeing that Mary appeared dead, he was leaving when he heard a sound coming from the bathroom. He opened the door and when he saw Charles, he asked if he was a surgeon. When Charles said he was, Clark shot him. After Clark left, Bailey started to treat Charles with Mary's help. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nThey packed his wound but it wasn't holding, so Bailey said they needed to get him to an OR. They put him on a sheet and dragged him out to the elevator, but when they got there, they realized the elevators had been turned off because of the lockdown and then Bailey concluded that Charles would die. She made good on his promise to tell him if that was going to happen and said that he didn't need to be scared because they'd be with him while it happened. When he stopped feeling pain, he knew it was a bad sign. He then asked Bailey to find Reed, not knowing that she was already dead, and tell her that he loved her. He also told her to tell her he was brave. Bailey told him he was very brave. He then told Bailey she was his favorite doctor and died. ''(\"[[Death and All His Friends]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Reed Adamson]]\nHe had a crush on [[Reed Adamson]], but never told her. When they were interviewed for the documentary, she told the interviewer that they've known each other since medical school and he was like a little brother to her.

''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nCharles first met Izzie when he apologized to her about Reed taking [[George O'Malley|George's]] cubby. Izzie initially ignored him, but after he talked about his family and himself, Izzie introduced herself. Charlie later asked her if she knew the Research Library code, but Izzie declined, saying she needed every advantage she could get. Izzie then showed him around the hospital and gave him tips. After he saw Izzie talking about her IL-, he confessed that he had crush on Reed. After, she gave him the Research Library code.\n\nTheir friendship later ended when Charles bragged that Izzie was his \"surgical bitch\", since she gave him the Research Library code and did many other deeds.

However, her speech was derailed when her pager didn't go off as she told the interns to move when she moves.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern.

''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting outside an on-call room trying to get some sleep, Dani, Steve, and Ryan heard a loud, painful moan when Mark broke his penis.

''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns worked on Patient X (actually Izzie using her own scans and labs) and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again.

In order to extend the time he could wait for a heart transplant, he wanted to insert an [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]]. When he heard he wouldn't be able to leave the hospital after getting the LVAD, Denny said he needed to think about it. After speaking to Izzie about it, he decided to have the LVAD implanted. ''(\"[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\")''\n\n\nWhile on the LVAD, Denny started experiencing shortness of breath. He had a pulmonary embolism. They tried to use a catheter to clear it, but they couldn't, so they had to open his chest. They were able to relieve the clot and he was stable after surgery. ''(\"[[Superstition]]\")''\n\nDenny then started looking into a portable LVAD, which would allow him to get up and out of bed. Izzie opposed the idea, which caused Denny to be hesitant about it. Despite this, he went ahead with it, but he was having trouble breathing while on it. They had to intubate him, which stabilized him. They thought the tubing in his LVAD had gotten kinked. He was stable and able to get up and walk around after they fixed the problem. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nWhile walking around the hospital with his portable LVAD, Denny collapsed and fell in the hallway after trying to use the stairs. His LVAD battery was nearly dead, so they took him back to his room. He was upset with being confined to the hospital and said he wanted to go home. Izzie tried to get his spirits back up with chocolate and tabloids, but he told her to stop, saying he hated being weak. He said if she knew what it was like, she would have let him die. ''(\"[[Damage Case]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a heart became available for Denny at [[Mercy West Medical Center]], he was prepped for the surgery. He decided before the surgery to sign a DNR, saying that he was done if he didn't get the heart.\n\nWhen the donor flatlined, Burke tried to get the other donor's heart for Denny. In order to help his case, Izzie lied on the phone and said that Denny was getting worse. However, when they asked for labs to confirm, she realized she had to make his heart actually worse in order to fool them. She decided to cut his LVAD wire. Denny tried to stop her, but he relented when she started crying and said that she would never forgive him for making her love him if he died. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\nAfter cutting his LVAD wire, Izzie manually pumped his heart. When she found out Burke had been shot and wasn't coming, George took over pumping and the interns decided that they'd have to get the tests results themselves. Cristina looked at his heart. At this point, Denny woke back up and proposed to Izzie before coding. They used adenosine to stabilize him. At this point, Bailey came looking for them and found out what they were doing. She took over treatment and then consulted with Richard to figure out what they should do about the heart. They submitted the labs and had the heart brought over for transplant as instructed by UNOS. Because Burke had been shot, [[Erica Hahn]] was brought in to perform the transplant. She placed the heart and attempted to get it started. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\nThe heart eventually started to beat and they closed. After surgery, he marveled at having warm hands and a regular heart beat. He was stable in his room, but later that night, he threw a clot off his incision and died of a stroke. ''(\"[[Losing My Religion]]\")''\n\n\nAfter his death, Izzie struggled to figure out what to do with the money he'd left her. She used about $, of it to pay for [[Heather Douglas]] to have surgery. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\nShe then decided to use the rest of the money to fund the free clinic that [[Miranda Bailey]] wanted to open. ''(\"[[Great Expectations]]\")''\n\nEight days later, the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]] opened to the public. ''(\"[[Wishin' and Hopin']]\")''\n\n\nMeredith's Near-Death Experience\nWhen Meredith drowned in [[Elliott Bay]], she woke up in the \"afterlife\" and saw Denny and [[Dylan Young]]. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nDylan and Denny bickered while Meredith wondered what she was doing, with Dylan wanted to tell her straight what was happening and Denny wanting to be more cautious about it. When it seemed that she had accepted her death and wasn't willing to fight to go back, they kept asking her what happened. They eventually got her to admit that she had stopped trying to survive. Denny told her that occasionally, he and Izzie would be in the same place at the same time and he could feel her. This made Meredith decide that she didn't just want moments with Derek, encouraging her to fight to go back. By then, they worried that she might be out of time. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\nIzzie's Hallucinations\nIzzie started seeing Denny while working on the case of the man who was supposed to get the heart she stole for Denny, [[Michael Norris]]. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nShe continued to see him as she worked on [[Clay Bedonie]], who suggested that she might be haunted by him. She had Alex burn the sweater she'd made him, which she kept. Despite this, she continued to see him. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nIzzie continued to see Denny and believed it was just memories, because they'd done the same things when he was alive, so he suggested they do something they hadn't done when he was alive, have sex. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\nBecause she was dating Alex, Izzie started talking to Denny about that and Denny expressed his disgust for seeing her with Alex. When she told Alex that she saw Denny sometimes, he dismissed it, saying it was cool with him because Denny's dead and he has her. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\nIzzie eventually asked Denny to leave, but he continued to stay and appear to her. He frequently said, \"I'm here for you,\" which frustrated her. He told her that she didn't have time to think about anything else. He said he thought that getting to be with her again was heaven, but then he started to think it was hell. Izzie eventually concluded that he was saying that because she was sick. She told him to leave, which he did. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\nAfter she learned that she had cancer, Izzie stopped seeing Denny for a while as she had the brain mets removed. When she saw him again, she knew it meant that she had a new brain met. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\nWhile the doctors fought over Izzie's treatment, she daydreamed about sitting on a beach with Denny. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\n\nHe says that he is funny and really nice. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Izzie lies with Denny.]]\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nDenny's father told [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] she was nothing like the women Denny usually dated.\n\nDenny first met Izzie when he was admitted to Seattle Grace Hospital as a heart transplant patient. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\nWhen he came back to the hospital later, their relationship started to develop more. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\nSoon, she started playing Scrabble with him and spending all her free time in his room, even though she was seeing Alex at the time. ''(\"[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\")''\n\nIzzie took a celibacy vow along with Meredith and Meredith took up knitting. Izzie had to knit pieces of sweater and replace the ones Meredith did because Meredith wasn't good at knitting. Denny was shocked that she'd taken a vow of celibacy because he wondered how he'd be able to get into her pants with her being celibate. In addition to this, she made Denny a sweater of his own, which she then wore for three hours before giving it to him. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\nAfter seeing the way Izzie and Denny reacted when they disagreed over the portable LVAD, Bailey became worried that their relationship was starting to cross a line. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nAfter a rough day for him, during which he fell while trying to use stairs, Izzie came into his room and crawled into bed with him, even after he warned her that she'd get in trouble. ''(\"[[Damage Case]]\")''\n\nWhen a heart became available for Denny, Izzie was told she couldn't prep him for surgery because she'd gotten too attached. However, she convinced Bailey to let her do it, with a warning that she better not get too close. When the heart fell through and she was trying to get the other one, she convinced him to let her cut his LVAD wire to make his heart worse. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\nAfter Izzie cut his LVAD, he lost consciousness for a while. When he came to, he proposed to Izzie. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\nAfter his heart transplant, he confirmed that he wanted to marry her. He wanted something that was his own choice after years of doctors making choices for him. She agreed to marry him. When Denny died, Izzie climbed into his bed and wouldn't leave until Alex told her that Denny's body was not him and picked her up off of him. ''(\"[[Losing My Religion]]\")''\n\nWhen his father came to meet Izzie after Denny's death, he told Izzie that Denny was rich and had written her a check for . million dollars and a voice message to his parents telling them he had met the love of his life. The money he had given to Izzie was used to establish ''[[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]]''.\n\n\nDenny's parents were devastated when he was diagnosed. He'd never been sick a day in his life before his heart failure. One day, Denny left a note for his parents saying he didn't want them to have to watch him die. They assumed he was dead until he left them a voicemail telling them he'd gotten a new heart and was getting married. ''(\"[[What I Am]]\")''\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nDenny was friendly to all the doctors, particularly Izzie, but when Meredith drowned in Elliott Bay, he was extremely kind to her in the ''after-life''. In the after life he could feel Izzie sometimes, if they were in exactly the same spot at exactly the same time. Denny also told Meredith that if she chose to die, she would only get moments with her loved ones. This changed Meredith.\n\n\n*His Zodiac sign was Capricorn.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*He loved to travel and cook.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*Denny died on May ,  at :pm, at the age of .<ref>[[Losing My Religion]], x</ref>\n*After he died, his body was sent to Memphis.<ref>[[Time Has Come Today]], x</ref>\n*Denny was scared of hospitals and could never sleep when he was in one, as he feared he wouldn't wake up.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*He loved animals.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*During a \"Morbidity and Mortality\" conference, he was referred to as patient number .<ref>[[Oh, the Guilt]], x</ref>\n*According to his father, he liked dark-haired, smart girls.<ref>[[What I Am]], x</ref>\n*He claimed that he was smart, but not a know-it-all.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*He made more posthumous appearances than antemortem appearances.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Begin the Begin]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Superstition]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[The Name of the Game]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Damage Case]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[ Seconds]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Losing My Religion]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Rise Up]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[These Ties That Bind]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[In the Midnight Hour]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[All By Myself]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Wish You Were Here]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Stairway to Heaven]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Here's to Future Days]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Denny Duquette Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Denny Duquette]]\n[[fr:Denny Duquette]]\n[[es:Denny Duquette, Jr.]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duquette, Denny Jr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He eventually was the perpetrator of a mass murder at the hospital.\n\n\n\nAlison had cancer and went in for surgery. At first, it seemed that the surgery went well, but there were complications. Gary was devastated when his wife had to be taken off life support. He was insistent that she could wake up, despite several doctors' professional opinions stating otherwise. Alison had signed forms three years prior to her death stating that if her survival was dependent on machines, she would like to be unplugged and allowed to die. Gary would not accept this as it was so long ago that she signed the forms. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\")''\n\n\nHe filed a lawsuit against [[Derek Shepherd]] and [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] over the death of his wife. Derek's lawyer stated that Gary had no case, as the hospital had acted in accordance with her advanced directive. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\nMr. Clark, grieving heavily, proceeded to stage a hospital killing spree. He purchased a gun and a large amount of ammunition. On his way to the hospital, he was in a car accident with [[Pete (Season )|Pete]]. When Pete got out to give Clark his insurance information, Clark shot him. He then proceeded to the hospital, where he tried to get someone to direct him to Derek's office. After being dismissed several times, he went into a supply closet, where he asked [[Reed Adamson]] to help him. When she said she was a surgeon and therefore too busy for him, he shot her in the forehead, killing her instantly. When [[Alex Karev]] came to investigate the gunshot, Clark shot him in the lower chest. He then met [[Cristina Yang]] on an elevator and she gave him directions to Derek's office, not knowing why he wanted to know.\n\nGary then went into an open area near a nurses' station where he shot [[Vivian (Sanctuary)|Vivian]] when she told him he couldn't leave the area.\n\nHe continued to move around the hospital, making his way to the floor where [[Mary Portman]] was in a room with Bailey. Charles Percy entered her room, saying the shooter was on the floor. Mary was frightened when Bailey looked through the window and saw Gary coming their way after shooting a security guard. She told Mary to play dead and covered her with the bed sheet. Charles hid himself in the bathroom and Bailey hid herself under Mary's bed.\n\nClark entered the room and started crying because he thought the hospital had killed another patient, like his wife. He pulled open the bed sheet and she nervously played dead and tried not to breathe. He was about to leave the room when he heard a noise in the bathroom. He discovered Charles, who confessed he was a surgeon. Gary then shot him in the abdomen and also pulled Bailey from under the bed. However, she said she was a nurse and Gary apologized and left the room after reloading his gun.\n\nHe then found Derek on the catwalk. Derek initially didn't recognize him, but then told him to find someplace safe. Clark told him that nowhere was safe in that hospital and held his gun up to Derek. Derek talked to him for a moment about how he was human and he was flawed. He finally got Clark to lower his gun when April came out of the office onto the catwalk and startled him. He then lifted the gun again and shot Derek in the chest. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nAfter shooting Derek, he aimed at April, but she talked to him, telling him about her life, showing him that she was a human being, and he told her to run. He then left the area when he saw members of the SWAT team.\n\nHe found [[Lexie Grey]], who was taking blood back to [[Alex Karev]]. He told her what he had intended to do, which was to shoot Derek, Webber, and herself. He went to shoot her, but he before he could, he was shot by a member of the SWAT team and Lexie ran away safely.\n\nFrom there, he went to peds, where he told [[Callie Torres]] he was bleeding. [[Arizona Robbins]] told him that there were only children in that ward. Callie gave him bandages and told him to press them to the wound to stop the bleeding. He took the bandages and left.\n\nFrom there, he went to the OR where Cristina was operating on Derek. He tried to get her to stop, but she refused. Meredith then offered herself up as the eye for an eye, saying that Lexie's her sister, Richard sees her as a daughter, and Derek's her husband. Cristina stopped him by telling him Meredith was pregnant. When he hesitated, Owen tried to charge him, but Clark shot him. Jackson then told Cristina to stop operating and disconnected his leads, making Clark believe Derek was dead. He left and once he was gone, they started operating again.\n\n\nFrom there, he went to the room where his wife died and he sat by himself. He realized that he only had one bullet left. He wanted to shoot Richard and then shoot himself, but he only had enough bullets for one of them, which caused him to want a drink from the flask he'd brought in place of additional ammo. Webber poured out the vodka in his flask and talked to him, saying that killing him wouldn't get him justice. He'd get arrested and taken to prison, but if he shot himself, he'd be free and might get to see his wife again. He shot himself rather than be arrested.

As an intern, George got off to a rough start but quickly became a very skilled and talented surgeon. He was best friends with Izzie Stevens. He was married to [[Callie Torres]] but divorced after he cheated on her. He was kind-hearted, compassionate, and loyal. He died after jumping in front of a bus to save [[Amanda|a woman's life]].\n\n\n\nAs a child, he was teased by a neighbor, Mike Wilden. Eventually, he snapped and hit Mike's face with a stick. When Mike's father later came over and yelled at George's father, [[Harold O'Malley|Harold]] asked George if it was true. When George denied it, Harold and Mike's father got into a big fight. Harold believed George because he thought he never lied. As a result of the fight, Mike's family threw eggs at George's house and [[Ronny O'Malley|Ronny]] and [[Jerry O'Malley|Jerry]] blew up their lawn mower.\n\nIn school, George was a mathlete. He won a blue ribbon in science for dissecting a fetal pig and was secretary and treasurer of the ''Dungeons and Dragons'' club, which is another example of his difference from his brothers.\n\nHe asked a girl out to prom and she said yes. He was surprised since she was cooler than he was. On the night of the prom, he got his dad's car for the night and rented the most expensive tux he could afford. He and his date enjoyed the prom until there was an after-party that they were supposed to go to. As they were driving, she asked him to go to the local college and it turned out that she wanted him to drop her off at her boyfriend's dorm. He dropped her off and even waited to make sure that she arrived okay.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nHe went to medical school at the School of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\n[[File:xElevatorSurgery.jpg|thumb|xpx|George operates in the elevator.]]\nWhen George was an intern, he and Alex were treating a GSW (Gun Shot Wound) patient. They were in the elevator with him and it broke down. Burke squeezed some supplies through the elevator so they could perform the surgery and talked George through the steps. Alex was too scared to do it, although he never admitted it, and later he was made fun of because he chickened out. George successfully completed the procedure in the elevator and saved the patient's life.\n\n\nGeorge had a dislocated shoulder, and came to an orthopedic surgeon. Her name is Callie. She reduced George's shoulder. Later in the day, Callie and George met up and Callie wrote her number on George's hand. He called her, but hung up every time because he was nervous.\n\n\nGeorge's father told him before his death to be with Callie. Shortly after his death, George then proposed to Callie (later admitting he did so because she said she loved him and it was his father's dying wish for George to be with Callie). They got married in Vegas and George had a hard time as the other interns, especially Izzie, thought he made a mistake by marrying her.\n\nCallie was suspicious of George and Izzie's friendship and told George that she thought Izzie was in love with him. After this fight, George went to see Izzie and the two got very drunk and slept together. George felt extremely guilty for cheating on Callie but ultimately decided he was in love with Izzie, not Callie. Callie suspected George was having an affair and both Mark and Addison encouraged Callie to act on her suspicions.\n\nLater, George told Callie that he slept with Izzie.\n\n\nGeorge failed his exam because he had been distracted by all of his life problems on the day of the exam. He was trying to help Meredith with her problems with Derek and the death of her mother.\nGeorge had to retake his intern year, he was one of Meredith's interns. George tried to keep the fact he was retaking a secret from the other interns and was doing well with the help of his fellow intern Lexie Grey, but Alex told all of the other interns that were praising him that they really shouldn't because he is really a repeater. \n\n\nGeorge intended to transfer to [[Mercy West Medical Center|Mercy West]] after his internship. After failing his intern exam, George needed to repeat his intern year at Seattle Grace. As a repeat intern, George became popular among the new interns and eventually became the Chief's intern (a job that [[Richard Webber|Chief Webber]] made up for George). Soon, he and [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]], whom he moved in with after his break-up with Callie, discovered that he only failed his exam by one point. George then confronted the [[Richard Webber|Chief]] and asked to be allowed to retake the exam early. He passed and became a resident.\n\n\nGeorge had a complicated relationship with Izzie. They were best friends and roommates. He and Stevens shared many fond memories together such as talking about his crush and about \"Jimmy and the twins.\"\nGeorge slept with Izzie and they both admitted that they were in love with one another, their romantic relationship ended George's marriage with Callie. However, they had a short lived romantic history, which broke off eventually.\n\n\n\n\nAfter he joined the army to be a trauma surgeon, Richard gave him the last day in the hospital off to spend time with his family. On his way home, George jumped in front of a bus to save [[Amanda|a woman's]] life. No one knew who he was because he was unrecognizable until Meredith went into check on \"John Doe.\ud George took her hand and traced ''. Meredith quickly figured out that it was, in fact, George. Many people didn't believe that it was George because there was no proof that he really did trace . [[Callie Torres]] remembered that George had a birthmark on his hand that looked like Texas, so she went to check and found his birthmark on his hand. His brain swelled during surgery and he was ultimately declared brain dead. Most of his organs were donated following the surgery.\n\nHe was mentioned again when his mother was admitted to Seattle Grace Mercy West following a botched operation at another hospital. It is during her surgery that Miranda Bailey admitted to Meredith that George was her favorite intern.\n\n\nDay of the Dead\nGeorge was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nInside Meredith's Visions\nWhen Meredith was diagnosed with COVID-, she began to slip in and out of consciousness, often waking up on a beach. On a lifeguard tower on the beach Meredith meets George and the two reflect on George's death and their residency. Later Meredith told George how he affected and changed her life.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nGeorge was compassionate and kind. During his early years, he spent his time camping with his father and his brothers hunting turkeys, although George refused to kill one every single year. George was often teased by his brothers due to his apparent lack of masculinity.\n\nHe was also very emotionally attached to his dog Bucky, whom he thought had run away, not knowing that his father accidentally ran over and killed the dog after he was chasing after the truck and got caught under the tire. His father, knowing that George would be devastated, lied to him.\n\nGeorge O'Malley loved his friends and was always there for them. He was a loyal friend and he was always ready for anything, even if at first he doubted himself. He was passionate about his job and he enjoyed helping people whenever he could.\n\n\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\n[[File:xGizzie.jpg|thumb|left|px|George and Izzie become friends immediately.]]\ue\n\nAs Cristina and Meredith quickly became friends and the other interns disliked Alex, George and Izzie quickly made friends and soon became best friends. Together they realized that they only watched and they needed to become \"doers\". Their friendship remained strong, although George disliked her relationship with Alex. After George slept with Meredith, he moved out and blamed Izzie. While treating a patient, they became best friends again, and their patient told George that he and Izzie argued so much because they cared about each other so much. George moved back into the house, which made Izzie happy (although she strongly disliked his girlfriend, [[Callie Torres]]). Izzie made fun of Callie constantly, especially when she found out Callie's middle name was Iphegenia. After seeing the ring George got Callie, she said, \"Tiny diamonds are great because you know what? No one will ever try to steal it.\" Callie later told George that Izzie acted that way because she loved him.\n\n[[File:GizzieBadSex.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Izzie realize that it isn't the right time for them and stay friends.]]\nAfter an argument, George left to ask Izzie for her support. They started drinking heavily and woke up the next day after having sex. Only Izzie remembered but after a while, George did too. He decided to pretend it never happened and didn't tell Callie. However he and Izzie shared another kiss and on Cristina's wedding day she told him that she would support him and Callie if he loved her but that she still loved him. After eighteen days of ignoring her, George told Izzie he wanted to be with her too but he needed to break up with Callie first. It took a while but eventually he told Callie he slept with Izzie. However, she misunderstood him and forgave him and took him back. He and Callie divorced later and Izzie and George started up a relationship. However, after failing to recreate the great sex they had before, they decided that although they had great chemistry it wasn't the right time. They decided to stay friends and maybe have a romantic relationship someday. When Izzie started seeing Denny, George was the first to notice something was wrong but she denied any accusations. George took it hard when Izzie told Cristina about her cancer before him. He started to avoid her but almost immediately he befriended her again. He supported her through her cancer, reminding her she was a doer. When George was rushed into a surgery and Izzie started to flatline, in a dream of some sort she went into an elevator and then saw George when the doors opened signifying his death.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n[[File:O'Callie.jpg|thumb|left|px|The newly-weds, Callie and George]]\nAfter his disastrous incident with Meredith, George focused on avoiding her. However, he fell down the stairwell at Seattle Grace and went to ortho to get his arm fixed. He met Callie and she gave him her phone number. He didn't call her for a while so Callie refused to speak with him. However he soon called and she forgave him. They began dating, much to the disapproval of Izzie. At the prom, Callie confessed to George that she loved him, but he didn't respond, as Izzie needed him for an emergency. George later told her that he didn't love her yet, but he could, and he didn't want to say it until he really meant it. However, George continued to leave Callie whenever Izzie or Meredith had a problem, which prompted Callie to break up with him and start sleeping with Mark Sloan. After discovering that Callie was sleeping with Sloan he refused to have any relationship with her. But they grew close again when George's father was admitted, and they kissed. After George's father died, George became addicted to sex to forget about his pain, and later he proposed to Callie. They flew to Las Vegas, and after two weeks they returned to Seattle Grace as a married couple.\n\nAfter speaking with his friends, George became worried that he made the wrong decision but eventually decided that he did make the right choice. However, after a fight with Callie, he went to visit Izzie. They got drunk and had sex, but George believed it was a mistake and they should forget what happened. After sharing another kiss with Izzie in an elevator, he decided that he was going to transfer to Mercy West. He and Callie decided to start trying to have a baby, but Izzie told George that she still had feelings for him. After  days of avoiding her, he decided he wanted to be with her so told Callie about the affair. She misunderstood and forgave him and took him back but the situation was cleared up and they decided to divorce. After the divorce, they remained friends.\n\n\n[[Image:O'MalleyFamily.png|thumb|left|px|George's family (minus his father).]]\n[[Harold O'Malley|Harold]] and [[Louise O'Malley]]\nHe loved his parents very much. After his father died, he said he would've given his heart to him.\n\n[[Jerry O'Malley|Jerry]] and [[Ronny O'Malley]]\nGeorge never got on well with his brothers. His brothers were jocks and he was a mathlete. However, they still protected him when they felt they had to. When the O'Malley family fought with the Wilden family, Ronny and Jerry blew up the Wilden's lawnmower for George. Every year at Thanksgiving, the brothers and their father would hunt turkeys. George refused to shoot the turkey but after years of refusing, George eventually gave in so that he could go back home and stop having to \"choose a car\". After hearing that George only assisted in surgeries, his brothers refused to call him a \"real doctor\" and often made fun of him. Overall, George is very different from his brothers.\n\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\n[[File:Crapartment.jpg|thumb|right|px|Lexie steals for George.]]\nAfter being separated from his class, George befriended Lexie. Lexie became like a best friend to George, and they even rented an apartment together. However, the apartment was awful, so in an attempt to get George to stay at their \"crapartment\", Lexie began stealing things from the hospital. George stayed and they grew closer but he got mad at her after she revealed that he only failed his exam by one point. However, Lexie's snooping managed to get George another chance at taking his intern exam and in a rush of excitement, he kissed her and she realized she had feelings for him. She continued to stay his friend, secretly loving him, but after becoming a resident, he forgot about Lexie and all her help so she refused to speak to him. George realized she liked him, but after she forgave him, she started to take an interest in Mark instead, so they remained friends.\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nGeorge and Cristina had lots of problems with their friendship. Cristina always treated George like a child and eventually called him \"\" and \"Bambi\". George was also one of the first to find out about Burke and Cristina's relationship. When George moved in with the two of them, she walked around the apartment naked once and Burke kicked George out.\n\nThings got worse when Burke was shot and received surgery. After the procedure, Burke began to get tremors in his right hand, and in Cristina's attempt to protect Burke, she didn't tell anyone. When George found out, he remembered that Burke was scheduled to operate on his (George's) father. After this point, George and Cristina's relationship worsens. George later explains that the reason he chose Cristina and Burke to operate on his father was that Cristina was a robot, \"a robot in a white coat who never makes a mistake.\" Cristina even tells his mother, Louise, that George is the best intern and a good person, and that his mother raised a good human being.\n\nGeorge was angry at Cristina for hiding Burke's tremor, and when all the interns forgave her, he did not, telling Meredith that she was the one that started calling him , and he didn't owe her any kind of support. When George's father died, at the beginning he was not able to talk to anyone, yet Cristina allowed him to and told him her father also died when she was little and said she was sorry to welcome him to the \"Dead Dad's Club\"; she understood how it felt to be without a father. After this revelation, they seemed to be cordial to each other.\n\nWhen Cristina found out that George signed up for the army, she cared for him, yet she described him as \"the guy who gets killed while cleaning his own gun.\"\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[File:GeorgeMerSTimeOut.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Meredith apologize during a time-out.]]\nFrom the moment George O'Malley met Meredith, he fell in love with her. Meredith however, was in love with Derek Shepherd so she never really thought about George as more than a friend. Only a patient and George's best friend [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] knew how he felt about Meredith. After a small push from Izzie, George decided to tell Meredith how he felt. Meredith had had a very bad day at work so when George confessed his feelings for her, she thought that maybe George was her guy and she had just overlooked him. They proceeded to kiss but during sex, knowing it wasn't right, Meredith burst into tears. George was humiliated and furious and for weeks he refused to speak to her. Eventually he accepted her apology but admitted that he was partly to blame too, he had known how she felt about [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and knew she didn't love him.\n\nTheir friendship continued and he moved back to her house. When George discovered that he had to repeat his intern year, he drew away from his group of friends but things soon went back to normal and Meredith and George's friendship continued, and was strengthened as she was his resident. On George's last day at Seattle Grace, he was hit by a bus and nobody could recognize him. Meredith was his doctor and although she didn't communicate with him often, she defended him in front of some of the other doctors and after he traced the word \"[[]]\" on her hand, she realized it was him and had him rushed into the [[Operating Room|O.R.]]\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nEver since the start of their internship, Alex has disliked George. On their first day as interns, George was given the name  (when he froze in his first surgery) by Alex and it was the start of their mutual dislike for each other. Later on, George learned that he had contracted syphilis from his girlfriend Olivia. George was given the name \"Syph-boy\" by Cristina but soon learned that Alex was the person that gave syphilis to Olivia, which lead to Alex being punched by George. And on a different occasion, when Alex told George that Callie had slept with Mark Sloan, George went into denial and got into another fight with him.\n\nAlex repeatedly and frequently pointed out George's flaws - calling him weak and pathetic more than once - but Alex later revealed that he actually respected George and that if he were still alive then he would have beaten all the other residents at each milestone (st solo surgery, chief resident, etc.). Professionally, George had beaten Alex during important situations, even though Alex was better at poaching surgeries, George would have been better at dealing with emergency cases while Alex would just have frozen (e.g. heart in the elevator). Later, when George's mother returned, which brings back memories of George, Alex revealed to Cristina and Meredith that he didn't like to think of George because it reminded him of Izzie (his ex-wife) which brought pain.\n\nOver the years, Alex\us views on George softened. When Meredith, Callie, and Alex were discussing all of the different doctors that lived in Meredith's house, George was brought up and Alex made a somber toast in his honor, showing that he truly did see him as a friend.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nIn the beginning, Miranda Bailey didn't care much for George. She treated him the same as any other intern, but after George helped deliver [[William George Bailey Jones|her baby]] when she was going through a rough time; she gained so much respect and gratitude for him. She even named her child after him, giving him the middle name George. Although there was never a strong friendship, they gained a bond beyond professional. When Miranda heard George had signed up for the army, she, along with Callie, tried her best to convince him not to go. When George died, she suffered a great loss. Later, when George's mother came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] for a surgery, Miranda wanted to make sure she got the best possible treatment. During surgery, Miranda revealed to Meredith that George was her favorite intern and was very saddened by his death, showing that she cared a tremendous amount for George O'Malley.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nSince George failed his first intern exam, Richard was more interested in the potential and knowledge that George had. Richard often gave guidance to George and helped him through many of his surgeries. After George passed away, Richard was very moved and sad. In a conversation with [[Derek Shepherd]], he let him know that he was teaching George so Derek could later take over for him as Chief of Surgery of Seattle Grace.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nWhen Owen and George were operating, Owen immediately saw that George had talent for [[Trauma Surgery]]. Eventually, Owen focused his teaching on George. Later, behind the scenes, Owen told George that he should join the army, and that George is going to be one of the finest trauma surgeons he's ever known. George's plans were stopped in their tracks, however, when he got hit by a bus and died in surgery.\n\nWhen he realized that George was brain-dead, Owen asked Chief Webber if he was a donor, since he could save many lives.\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\nUpon first meeting George, Burke disliked him. George accidentally offended him and Burke chose George to be the intern he punished a lot which would force the others to fall in line. He allowed George to scrub in with him on his first day and insulted and terrified him. However, after working on more cases, George and Burke grew to have a friendship and Preston christened George his \"guy.\ud When George moved out of Meredith's house and had nowhere to go, Burke allowed him to sleep at his apartment. They went running together and acted like a team constantly. Eventually, Cristina managed to get George to move out but he and Burke remained friends, even after he left Cristina on their wedding day.\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nGeorge initially disliked Shepherd because of the latter's relationship with Meredith. During his neurosurgery rotation, he called out on the anesthesiologist Dr. Taylor after smelling alcohol in his breath but was dismissed by Shepherd. When Dr. Taylor fell asleep during surgery, Shepherd promptly kicked him out. After the surgery, Derek commended George for speaking up and admitted that he, as the main surgeon and attending in charge, was at fault for failing to notice Dr. Taylor's breath.\n\nGeorge died on Shepherd's operating table. Shepherd had saved him the first time but he coded the second time as his injuries were too extensive.\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\nGeorge didn't have a close relationship with Sadie. He also didn't understand how Meredith could be friends with her. During the intern bowl, he noticed Sadie didn't have the basic medical knowledge for her level. He also caught her cheating to win. George offered her assistance, but at the end, he gave her an ultimatum that he would tell the chief or she would have to. After that, Sadie quit and called George an \"ass.\ud\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\nWhile not known for being friendly towards interns and residents, Erica Hahn did not seem to treat George any differently from other interns and residents. She did not seem to have a problem with him being in her O.R. Before starting her employment as head of cardiothoracic surgery at Seattle Grace, George 'hired' her to operate on his father as he knew of Preston Burke's tremor following his gunshot wound. Despite clashing with George during her tenure as his father's surgeon, she did not appear to hold this against him during her time at SG. George managed to talk two of Hahn's reluctant patients into having surgery. Hahn was [[Haunt You Every Day|called to]] Seattle Grace to harvest a heart from a brain-dead car accident victim whose father was in the hospital awaiting a heart transplant. He refused to take his daughter's heart. However, he agreed after George told him he would have donated his heart to his father if it would have saved him. George later also talked a frightened -year-old into having heart surgery after showing him the inside of an O.R. so he would know how things worked in there and would no longer be scared. While Hahn originally refused, she eventually consented to the plan.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|xpx|George holds a dress for Mark.]]\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMark Sloan disliked most interns and George was no exception. After George and Callie divorced, Mark decided to humiliate George for Callie so when two patients were admitted in a competition which involved holding a wedding dress, Mark ordered George to hold the dress while he treated one of the girls.<ref>[[Kung Fu Fighting]], x</ref> However, at Lexie's request, Sloan vowed that he would become less cruel to O'Malley.\n\n\nAmanda\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|ox|Amanda stays with George.]]\nGeorge met Amanda the day before he left to join the army. They met at a bus stop but when he smiled at her and she ignored him, interested in finding better-looking guys, a bus almost hit Amanda. George threw himself under it and pushed her out of the way, saving her life. They were brought to Seattle Grace, George's face unrecognizable and Amanda's arm in a sling. Because nobody knew who the John Doe was, no family was called so Amanda refused to leave his side. She stayed with him as much as possible. Before discovering it was George, Meredith said to him that he ''\"...made a good friend there. Guess thats what happens when you take a bus for someone.\ud''\n\n[[Carlos Torres]]\n[[File:George&Mr.TorresS.jpg|thumb|left|px|Mr. Torres holds George by the neck.]]\nWhen Mr. Torres first met George, he mistrusted him because he assumed that George had married Callie for her money. It didn't help that George was hungover. Callie, her father, and George met at Joe's bar where they discussed finance and how George apparently talked too much. However, when Mr. Torres started talking about giving them money, George refused it having just remembered sleeping with Izzie the previous night. Mr. Torres later approached him and told him that he just wanted to protect his daughter and warned George not to hurt her. Months later after George and Callie's divorce, Mr. Torres came to visit his daughter at Seattle Grace. When he spotted George he pushed him up against a wall and threatened to kill him for cheating on Callie but Callie told her father that she had cheated on him with Mark too. Mr. Torres dropped George who ran away and grabbed Mark Sloan instead.\n\n\nHe attended [[Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine]].\n\nWhen George applied to become an [[Internship|intern]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]], he barely made it into the program (although George later discovered he had the most, and best, recommendation letters). During the beginning of his internship, he was picked by Dr. [[Preston Burke]] to perform the first surgery of all the interns. During the surgery, he almost killed the patient and earned the nickname \"\" (after James Bond's License to Kill). Later in their intern year, George and [[Alex Karev]] get stuck in an elevator with a patient who has been shot. The patient begins to bleed out and when Alex freezes up, Burke has to talk George through surgery and George \"flies solo\" for the first time.\n\nAt the end of his intern year, George failed his intern exams. By the time the summer ended, George seemed to have changed his mind and went ahead with repeating his internship with Meredith as his resident.\n\nInitially, none of the new interns knew that George was a repeat intern. Lexie kept his secret and stayed by his side as a friend when all of the other interns find out about it. He moves in with her and starts accepting and living with what he has, befriending the other interns and hosting a party at their ugly apartment (or as they called it, ''[[The Crapartment|crapartment)]]''. It was later revealed that George failed the intern exam by only  point and received  outstanding letters of recommendation, making him and Lexie doubt his repeated internship even more. During a brief outburst at the chief, George is allowed to retake the intern exam. When he comes home to Lexie, they share a brief celebratory kiss although just as friends (although Lexie looked hopeful for more). George finally passes his intern exam, after a little difficulty from a hospital flooding and after a little friction with his interns, he became as qualified as the rest and as Izzie tells him he is the best, putting the most time into teaching and hours in the skill lab.\n\nOwen Hunt joins the hospital, he notices George's talent in trauma surgery and urges him to choose Trauma as his specialty. After connecting with a patient from Iraq, who like himself, had a family completely different from him, George decided to go to be commissioned as a medical officer in the Army and serve in Iraq.\n\nAfter telling the Chief of his decision, he was given the day off to spend some time with his family before he left, preventing an intervention by Bailey, Callie, Meredith, Cristina, Izzie, and Alex. The same day, a patient was admitted after jumping in front of a bus to save a woman, his face unrecognizable with severe injuries to his left arm, head, face, pelvis, and abdomen. Meredith was the resident assigned to the case and remained with the patient, and he attempted to communicate with her using his hand due to him being intubated. The second attempt to communicate with Meredith, he wrote down the numbers '''' for her. Initially confused, Meredith realized that it was George writing his nickname. She got up and told all the other doctors. George was rushed into surgery while Izzie coded. In some sort of afterlife, dream, or hallucination, the two met, Izzie in her prom dress and George in an army uniform.\n[[File:GeorgeinUniform.jpeg|thumb|George in his army uniform.|xpx]]\n\n\n*He was the first main character to perform a surgery, to call time of death, and to inform a relative about a patient's death.\n*He and Lexie nicknamed their apartment ''[[The Crapartment]]''.\n*He had a freckle in the shape of Texas on his right hand.<ref>[[Good Mourning]], x</ref>\n*George could play the clarinet.\n*He had a Catholic background.\n*In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, [[Shonda Rhimes]] had said that she requested [[T.R.

However, they were able to get her to stay. They put in a chest tube and took her to surgery.\n\nIn surgery, they found a part of a bullet and noted it was a devastator. Cristina found another bullet, but set it off, doing more damage to Gina's body. They repaired all the damage they could find, but her blood pressure was low, meaning she was bleeding from somewhere. They determined the uterine artery to be the cause and they were forced to perform a hysterectomy to save her life.

Owen said that she could leave if her white count was high enough, but the tests showed that it was not.\n\nFive weeks later, she was still in the hospital and in much worse condition.

While an intern, her resident was [[Izzie Stevens]] until reassigned to [[George O'Malley]].\n\n\n\nOn her first day of internship, she was assigned to [[Izzie Stevens]], who took the group on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules. Her interns viewed her as the dud, having heard that she'd spent some time on probation after killing someone.\n\nAfter they spent the day saving a deer with Izzie, she said that they were the dud interns.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nClaire, Graciella, Leo, and Mitch all attended a housewarming party thrown by George and Lexie. They all ended up coming to work drunk the next day. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nThe night after the party, the interns planned a darts tournament. When George invited Izzie, they started considering dropping out because they didn't want to play darts with their boss. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural as practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella was affected by George's death. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program. She survived the first round of layoffs. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella participated in a documentary someone made about the doctors at the hospital. During the documentary, she went through two different relationships and decided to rethink her approach. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella was locked down in peds when [[Gary Clark]] brought a gun to the hospital. She informed [[Arizona Robbins]] and [[Callie Torres]] when [[Ruby Kendall|Ruby Kendall's]] appendix burst. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Pierce Halley]]\nShe and Pierce dated for two weeks after Megan left him. She broke up with him when she saw him talking to Megan. He was unaffected by the news. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n[[Charles Percy]]\nShe developed a crush on Charles after dumping Pierce. They hung out at the bar together, but he made it clear they were just friends. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella was one of the many interns who befriended George and went to his intern parties. She was also one of the many that knew Lexie loved George.\n\nShe and [[Steve Mostow]] are best friends. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nShe originally disliked Izzie, calling her a \"dud\" resident. When Izzie came back to work, Graciella was much nicer, claiming that her mother's church prayed for Izzie. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nDr. Guzman originally worked as an [[Internship|intern]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She worked as an intern first for Izzie and then for George. She was part of the secret intern society but when the interns were about to operate on Sadie, she left as she felt scared.\n\nWhen Izzie was debating which intern to give to George, she said \"''Graciella charts like crap. But she can put in a line''\".\n\nDr. Guzman became a second year [[Resident|resident]] and survived the first round of lay-offs when [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] merged with [[Mercy West Medical Center]].\n\n\n*Graciella was originally credited as ''Graziella''.\n*Graciella is religious.<ref>[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]], x</ref>\n*She doesn't chart well, but she can put in a line.<ref>[[There's No 'I' in Team]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nInternGraciella.png|[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\nInternGraziella.png|[[Let the Truth Sting]]\nInternGraziella.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\nInternGraziella.png|[[Piece of My Heart]]\nInterns.png|[[Here Comes the Flood]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Brave New World]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Rise Up]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[These Ties That Bind]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[In the Midnight Hour]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[All By Myself]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Wish You Were Here]]\nInterns.png|[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Before and After]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[An Honest Mistake]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Elevator Love Letter]]\nxMeganGraciella.png|[[Good Mourning]]\nxGraciellaClaire.png|[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\nxGraciellaGuzman.png|[[Invasion]]\nxGraciellaGuzman.png|[[Sanctuary]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Graciella Guzman Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Graciella Guzman]]\n[[fr:Graciella Guzman]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guzman, Graciella}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Webisode Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

The O'Malley patriarch was a truck driver with a passion for vintage cars. He died at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] due to multi-system organ failure.\n\n\n\nEvery year, Harold took his three sons out hunting to shoot a turkey. When he was an intern, Harold insisted that it would be George's year to shoot the turkey. While they were out in the woods, the others started trading cars, but George didn't participate. They believed it was because he didn't know anything about cars, but he explained that it was always the same conversation over and over again and he was tired of it. George ultimately did shoot the turkey, but as they were packing up, one of them accidentally shot Harold in the butt. George took him to the hospital where he removed the birdshot and stitched him up. ''(\"[[Thanks for the Memories]]\")''\n\nIn addition to taking his sons turkey hunting every Thanksgiving, Harold also took the boys on camping trips to White River at least once a month. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\n\nHarold was brought to the hospital, where [[Callie Torres]] treated him. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\nHe had passed out, fallen, and broken his clavicle. Callie said his clavicle would be fine, but he was complaining of abdominal pain, so they scheduled an endoscopy. The endoscopy showed that Harold had esophageal cancer that had spread to his stomach. He was told he'd need surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation to treat it. His EKG showed abnormalities, so they looked at his heart and found out that he had a leaking aortic valve. He needed to have his valve replaced before they could start treating the cancer. George insisted that Burke do the valve replacement, because he's the best. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nHowever, after becoming suspicious about Burke's hand, George talked to [[Erica Hahn]] and hired her to do his father's valve replacement. When Harold and Louise heard, they wondered why George would want Erica to do the surgery instead of Burke. After talking to Izzie about the switch, they decided to go back to having Burke do his surgery. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nThe day of his surgery, Harold went into V-tach and had to be given lidocaine. He was then taken in to have his valve replaced and it went well. ''(\"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\")''\n\nAfter his heart surgery, Harold said he felt better than ever, so his extended family came to visit and have a bit of a party before he started cancer treatment, figuring he wouldn't be feeling up to visitors after starting treatment.\n\nBefore his initial cancer surgery, which was mostly exploratory, Harold met with an oncologist, who said they might not complete the surgery if they saw that the tumor had invaded other organs. He asked them to remove all the tumor, no matter what, saying O'Malleys are fighters and he could fight it. Richard agreed to do so.\n\nIn surgery, they discovered that the tumor had spread, but they abided by Harold's wishes and removed as much of the tumor as they could.\n\nAfter surgery, the big concern was multi-system organ failure. George monitored his kidneys as those would be the first to go, but his kidney function was good. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, he was intubated. The tube kinked and had to be replaced, but because of the swelling in his throat, putting in a new tube was difficult. His family was warned ahead of time that they might not be able to place a new tube and he'd die. It took Bailey a few tries to intubate, but she was able to get a new tube in.\n\nShortly after that, his urine output started to decline as his kidneys failed. His other organs started to fail and his family was informed that he was entirely dependent on his life support machines. They were given the choice to keep him on life support and allow nature to take its course or they could take him off life support. They chose to take him off life support after asking George, who said that Harold was in pain. They removed the tube and stayed with him while he died. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe was married for  years (since he was ) to his wife, Louise, and took great pride in all his sons.\n\n\nHarold was close with Ronny and Jerry. His bond with George was more distant and they struggled to understand each other, but still loved each other.\n\n\nHarold was a truck driver.

The growth was easily removed and he was told it would heal quickly, but once his son and daughter-in-law were out of the room, he confessed that he was really there to have a penis pump implanted to combat his erectile dysfunction. He was seeing a woman in his retirement home and didn't want to disappoint her. When his son and daughter-in-law heard what he wanted to do, they tried to talk him out of it. They worried about his health, but he was cleared for surgery. His son then said they'd talked about it and if he had the surgery, they'd force him to move home.

She was a surgical resident at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] until she was fired shortly after the merger with [[Mercy West Medical Center]]. Engaged to [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]] until his death, she is now in a relationship with her ex-husband, [[Alex Karev]]. Together, they have twins, [[Alexis Stevens|Alexis]] and [[Eli Stevens|Eli]].\n\n\n\nIzzie grew up in Forest Park, on Route , behind a church in Chehalis, Washington.<ref name=\":\">[[Break on Through]], x</ref> She lived in a trailer park with her [[Robbie Stevens|mother]] who nicknamed her \"Cricket\"<ref>[[Save Me]], x</ref> Sometimebefore her residency, her maternal grandmother died of thyroid cancer.<ref name=\":\" />\n\nAs a teenager, Izzie worked as a waitress and had savings for college, but her mother spent most of the saved money on psychics. This forced Izzie to pay most of the bills with her own money. \n\nAt age fifteen, Izzie became pregnant.<ref>[[New History]], x</ref> She gave birth to a baby girl and placed her for adoption at sixteen in order to give her a better life. She secretly named the girl Sarah, but her parents named her [[Hannah Klein|Hannah]].<ref name=\":\" /> Because of her pregnancy, mothers made their children stay away from Izzie so she struggled to make friends.\n\nAt her high school prom, the football quarterback was her date. Since her school didn't have a lot of money, they just converted the gym.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nWhen she turned eighteen, she left home. She paid for medical school by modeling designer \"[[Bethany Whisper]],\" which led to her receiving the nickname \"Dr. Model.\"<ref>[[No Man's Land]], x</ref>\n\nShe attended the [[University of Washington School of Medicine]].\n\n\nIzzie started out as an intern at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] under fourth-year resident [[Miranda Bailey]], alongside [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], and [[George O'Malley]]. She and George soon became Meredith's roommates.\n\n[[Alex Karev]] was later reassigned as Miranda's resident.\n\n\nIzzie developed a strong relationship with Alex, but was subsequently mocked for it.\n\nAlex took Izzie out on a date, but Izzie was insulted that he wasn't acting like himself and he didn't bother to kiss her goodnight, not knowing that Alex felt \"off his game\" because he heard that he failed his boards. Izzie was annoyed at Alex for ruining the date and not kissing her until Alex went to Joe's and kissed her passionately. This sparked their first relationship, though Alex still struggled to become intimate with Izzie. \n\nLater, Izzie saw Alex and [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]] having sex in an on-call room, devastating her. When Alex was studying for his boards, Izzie finally broke down in front of him as she tried to help him study. Eventually, she was able to forgive Alex, and they were on friendly terms again.\n\nTheir feelings for each other started to spark again after Izzie and Alex had sex for the first time following the bomb in the body cavity incident. They were on the brink of a second go at a relationship when [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]] returned to the hospital, re-igniting Izzie's interest in him.\n\n\nIzzie met Denny, a cardio patient, who immediately took a liking to Izzie. As time went on, the two got closer to the point that they fell in love with each other. Still, Denny needed a new heart, only alive due to his [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]].\n\nA heart became available, but when the heart donor flat-lined, Burke and Alex attempted to take [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Hahn's]] heart in order for Denny to receive a heart that day. However, Hahn's transplant patient had been put on the donor list  seconds before Denny. Knowing the only way that Denny would get the heart would be if his condition worsened immediately, Izzie cut Denny's LVAD wire so that this would happen. Upon arrival at Seattle Grace, Burke was shot and Hahn was needed to do the surgery. While the surgery was completed successfully, Denny soon after died from an unexpected stroke.\n\nAfter Denny died, Izzie confessed to Chief Webber that she cut the LVAD wire, but she felt she was no longer a doctor. She quit the program. After some time mourning Denny, endlessly baking and a visit from [[Miranda Bailey]], Izzie started to heal. Initially intending to clean out her locker, Izzie watched Cristina stitching up a heart from the gallery. This reignited her passion for medicine, and she returned to Seattle Grace. The Chief put her on probation, with Dr. Bailey adding extra punishments such as only observing and no talking or interacting with patients. She was eventually taken off of probation after helping a victim of the [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] crash.<ref>[[Drowning on Dry Land]], x</ref>\n\nIzzie received an inheritance check from Denny for $.M. She didn't deposit the check for a while, which stressed her roommates out. Finally, Izzie deposited the check but was unsure how to spend it as she wanted Denny's money to go towards something meaningful. When [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] got approval for a free clinic, Izzie realized Denny's money could fund it, and she put almost all of her inheritance towards the new clinic, naming it the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]]. \n\n\nIzzie became a second-year resident at Seattle Grace after passing her intern exams. Her first day on the job resulted in her treating a deer in the back of a pick-up truck which her new interns thought was ridiculous and a waste of her time.\n\nAs she struggled to get her feet grounded, she became more infatuated with George and his life, practically waiting for his marriage to [[Callie Torres]] to implode. After a bad fight with Callie, George came over to drink with Izzie, and they ended up drunkenly sleeping together. Izzie remembered everything the next morning, but it wasn't until later in the day that their night together came back to George. Both initially agreed to keep it a secret between each other, saying it would never happen again and it didn't mean anything. As time wore on, both Izzie and George realized they did indeed have feelings for each other, and George agreed to tell Callie about his one-night stand. After doing so, Izzie and George attempted a relationship but discovered that their sexual chemistry was non-existent apart from that first night. Their relationship fizzled out, and George moved into an apartment with [[Lexie Grey]].\n\n\n\n\nIzzie started hallucinating her dead fianc\ue, [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette.]] \n\nIzzie discovered that she was misdiagnosed with anemia when she actually had high LDH levels. She went into a private room and started to examine her body for any enlarged lymph nodes or suspicious moles. She then discovered a mole on her back. Izzie and [[George O'Malley]] went to dermatology, [[Daisy Pepman]] removed her mole and told her she shouldn't be worried about it. Daisy later came back with her results that the mole was malignant.. Izzie gathers her interns and creates \"Patient X\" who is actually Izzie, had her interns try to diagnose her. The interns conclude that \"Patient X\" is fine, and at most she has an anxiety disorder. This makes Izzie very frustrated, saying \"Patient X\" has been having visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations. \n\nIzzie is conversing with George when [[Lexie Grey]] comes up to her, explaining they have new on \"Patient X\". Lexie explained they should check for a malignancy in the brain. Which was done by using an MRI. Izzie had multiple scans including an upper G.I., and a head CT before that.The interns later diagnose her with Stage IV metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, brain, and skin, with a % survival rate. Izzie later asked what Lexie would say to \"Patient X\" if she had the chance. Lexie says \"Patient X\"  should screw the odds and argues that her mother died of the hiccups, which probably have a % survival rate.[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|riht|px|Izzie gets treated for her cancer.]]\nIzzie chose to tell Cristina about her cancer, and Cristina set her up with the best surgical oncologist in the state as well as producing masses of research, but Izzie chose to blow off the appointment, making Cristina wonder why she ever confided in her to begin with. Eventually, Cristina couldn't handle the pressure and told an OR full of staff, including Alex and Bailey, of Izzie's diagnosis, which gave Izzie the final push to fight for her life, and she finally admitted herself into Seattle Grace as a patient.\n\nIzzie's first part of her treatment was to have the temporal lobe metastases removed by Derek, who returned to surgery to operate on Izzie following his breakdown. Meredith also suggested to Izzie that she has obstetrics remove healthy eggs from her, for her future. The first stage of her treatment was successful, as Derek removed the tumor fully from Izzie's temporal lobe, no thanks to [[Rebecca Swender]], Izzie's oncologist who constantly second-guessed Derek during surgery until Derek found his rhythm and quiets Dr. Swender.\n\nFollowing the news of her cancer and Meredith and Derek's wedding, she began to plan the wedding and even created [[Meredith and Derek's Wedding Website]]. However, after discovering another tumor in her brain due to the appearance of Denny, Meredith and Derek gave away their wedding to Izzie and Alex and they got married. She then did the risky surgery, and the tumor was successfully removed.\n[[File:Izziecomesbacktolife.png|thumb|xpx|Izzie's DNR order is ignored and successfully resuscitated.]]\nWhile Alex embraced Izzie after realizing that some of her memory returned, Izzie went limp and her pressure started dropping. Alex called for Cristina, who arrived shortly before Richard Webber and Miranda Bailey arrived and he demanded that they resuscitate her, but Cristina told the others that Izzie signed a DNR. Initially, the other doctors wanted to abide by the DNR, but Richard soon gave in, stating, \"Screw the DNR,\" and started to resuscitate her.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\nDuring the budget cuts at Seattle Grace, Izzie accidentally administered an incorrect dosage of medicine to a patient, causing her not to get a much-needed kidney transplant. This caused Chief Webber to fire her. Thinking [[Alex Karev|Alex]] was partly to blame, Izzie wrote him a letter and left.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Alex and Izzie say goodbye. ]]\n\nIzzie later returned to Seattle for a final PET scan and to ask Derek to put in a good word for her, so she could get a job in Tacoma and repair things with Alex. Derek learned that Tacoma didn't want to hire her because of her history, but he planned on hiring Izzie back once he was given the job of Chief of Surgery. At the same time, Izzie went to show Alex that her scan was clean, meaning she was officially not dying of cancer. He was genuinely happy for her but felt he deserved better. Knowing she was okay, he told her to leave, be happy, and not come back. Realizing that there was nothing left to repair, Izzie went to Meredith's house to pack her stuff. Meredith begged her not to throw the people that loved her aside and not to leave, as it was her home. Izzie responded saying that Seattle Grace wasn't her home anymore, that it was just a place she used to work at and she can do that anywhere. This makes a tearful Meredith frown and turn away, letting her go. As Izzie exhales, she is left to start all over again somewhere else.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref> \n\n\nAround four years after leaving Seattle, Izzie was single and wanted children. Due to chemo for the cancer, she lost the ability to get pregnant, and she used the frozen embryos from before treatment to try and have kids. It was successful and she gave birth to twins, whom she named Eli and Alexis. The three of them live out on the country in Baldwin City, Kansas, where she now works as a surgical oncologist.\n[[File:xIzzieStevens.png|thumb|Alex and Izzie with their twins.]]\nFive years after having twins, Meredith's medical license was in jeopardy. Alex called her to see if she could write a letter of support in the trial. Alex admitted the trial gave him an excuse to call her and see how she was doing many years later. As Alex and Izzie talked, he described it being as if no time had passed between them and felt they left something unfinished. He later learned she had kids, and that in fact the kids were his. He then got on with the trial and went to see her and the kids. He eventually decided to stay with Izzie and their twins to build a life together.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\n\nIzzie always thinks there's some good in people, no matter how bad they are. Her motivations are always for what she believes to be the right thing. She is very optimistic, bubbly, and bright. The first impression she gives is a confident and friendly woman.\n\nShe is also very kind, protective, and often stubborn. She seems to get too emotionally involved in most cases, which she sees as a good thing, although others feel it gets in the way of the medicine.\n\nIzzie is very loyal to all her friends, and in most cases, can be trusted. She likes seeing others happy and is constantly trying to cheer people up. This attitude, however, is not extended to certain individuals. For example, she goes out of her way every chance she gets to belittle and bring down George and Callie after they eloped, eventually breaking the marriage up completely by sleeping with George. During the entire time she knew Callie, Izzie acted like a childish and inappropriate individual; constantly laughing at her and poking fun of intimate details about Callie\us life she had only wanted George to know. She is also a hopeless romantic. She bakes/cleans a lot almost to an obsessive level when she is sad or stressed.\n\nIzzie can often be taken as a meddler when she tries to help people when they do not necessarily ask for help. She can really bring the pain if she believes she has been wronged or hurt emotionally. She can hold a grudge or retaliate when someone tries to take advantage of her kindness and good intentions.\n\n\n\n[[Hank]]\nWhen she started her internship, Izzie was dating the professional hockey player Hank. They soon broke up due to her long working hours and distance.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nWhen [[Alex Karev]] discovered her history as a model, he didn't waste any time in putting up her lingerie advertisements all over [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Despite the incident, she saw through Alex's shallow, callous exterior and befriended him, to the shock of her friends.\n\nWhen he eventually asked her out, she was disappointed that he didn't have the courage to kiss her. For a while she refused to speak to him until spontaneously at Joe's bar, he kissed her.\n\nDespite dating Alex, a heart patient named Denny Duquette continually flirted with her. It led nowhere and he left the hospital shortly after they met after failing to receive a new heart.\n\n[[File:Alex_izzie_kiss.jpg|thumb|px|Alex and Izzie kiss.]]\n\nDue to some difficulties on Alex's part, their sexual relationship didn't take off. And after Izzie caught Alex sleeping with [[Olivia Jankovic|Nurse Olivia]], she ended their relationship and was furious with him. When Izzie discovered her friends were helping Alex study for his failed boards she blew up at them although she eventually forgave him and helped him study as well. Even though she forgave him she ruled out the possibility of another relationship with him.\n\nWhen there was a bomb scare in the hospital, Izzie felt she needed to do what she wanted before it was too late. She proceeded to have sex with Alex in a linen closet again several times throughout the day. Alex assumed that they were dating again but Meredith told him that they were only sleeping together and Izzie wouldn't ever think of him the same after his incident with [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]].\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Alex and Izzie get married.]]\n\nLater, Izzie gave [[Alex Karev|Alex]] an ultimatum. She told him either to be the nice guy or the jerk but he couldn't be both. He kissed her and they later decided to go steady. Things went well but Denny began to appear to Izzie and she even had sex with him. Shockingly, it turned out that the appearances of Denny were because of an illness she had.\n\nMeredith and Derek gave their wedding to Izzie after discovering her tumor and she got married to Alex.\n\nIzzie's time with cancer was rough, and it took a toll on her relationship with Alex. After she was fired from SGMW, she left Alex. Eventually, she did come back, wanting to reunite with Alex when she found out her cancer was gone. However, he refused, wanting someone who would stay. Soon afterwards, she sent him divorce papers and he signed them.\n\nWhen Meredith needed letters for her trial, Alex called Izzie, and in their conversation she revealed that she had given birth to twins, using a frozen embryo that she and Alex had saved when she was starting her cancer treatment. He went to Kansas to visit them, decided to stay, and began a life with Izzie and their family.\n\n[[Denny Duquette, Jr.]]\nWhen Denny was readmitted to the hospital after suffering cardiac dysrhythmia, Izzie brushed Alex off so she could tend to Denny. Alex felt threatened by Denny so he told Denny he should back off because he would probably die from heart failure and if he did it would hurt Izzie. When Izzie found out that Alex said this to Denny, she confronted him and he replied that she could not get involved with patients. She later realized that she did not have to settle for Alex.\n[[File:Cutting the LVAD.jpg|thumb|xpx|Izzie cuts Denny's LVAD wire]]\n\nHowever, Denny survived and they grew closer. He had an [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] inserted to keep him alive for longer so he could wait for a heart, but after finding out that Denny had become a DNR (do not resuscitate) patient, Izzie jumped at the chance to get him a new heart. After discovering that he lost a donor heart to someone on the donor list who was ahead of him by  seconds, she implored him to let her cut his [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire so his condition would worsen and he would move up on the donor list. At first, Denny refused because it would end her medical career and he didn't want to steal a heart out of another man's chest but after Izzie broke down crying and begged him, he agreed. Izzie cut Denny's LVAD wire and sought the help of her fellow interns to keep him alive.\nAs the interns struggled to keep Denny alive, Cristina informed them that Denny's surgeon, [[Preston Burke]], was shot and struggling to survive. After hearing the news, Izzie panicked, completely at a loss. In the midst of the chaos, Denny proposed to a shocked Izzie. [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] walked in on the interns and banned them all from any surgeries until the person who cut the LVAD wire confessed. Meanwhile, Alex invited Dr. Erica Hahn to replace Dr. Burke on Denny's heart transplant surgery. Dr. Hahn successfully completed Denny's transplant surgery and when Izzie visited Denny after his transplant she accepted his marriage proposal. Denny died from a stroke shortly thereafter leaving Izzie devastated and lying next to Denny's body. Alex carried her off the bed and told her that the body wasn't Denny and that Denny loved her and he wouldn't want Izzie to do this to herself. After a long period of mourning, Izzie moved on but refused Alex's offer of a relationship.[[Image:x-.jpg|right|thumb|px|Izzie lying with a deceased Denny.]]\n[[George O'Malley]]\nWhen Izzie discovered that George liked Meredith, she encouraged him to tell her. Eventually, he did but after his disastrous sexual encounter with her, he moved out of the house, much to Izzie's disappointment. Despite several attempts, George refuses to tell Izzie where he is currently living. Eventually, he moved back in and frequently had his new girlfriend, [[Callie Torres|Dr. Callie Torres]], over, much to Izzie's dismay. Izzie made it very clear to George that she disapproved of her presence in his life because she considered Callie a freak. After taking multiple jibes, Callie told George it was because Izzie was in love with him.\n\nAfter Callie disclosed the fact that she was somewhat wealthy and was paying most of their bills herself and didn't mind doing so, a hurt George told Meredith, who told Izzie. Izzie used this information when making a snide remark about Callie, knowing it would hit a nerve. Infuriated at his indiscretion, Callie kicked George out of their hotel room after voicing her opinion that Izzie \"had feelings\" for George. Upset and confused, George went to Izzie and Meredith's house with a bottle of bourbon and after getting drunk, Izzie and George slept together. The next day, George had no recollection of their intimacy the previous night and didn't remember until he was having lunch with Callie and her father. George confronted Izzie about it in a linen closet at the hospital and after they almost kissed, George left in a surge of guilt. Later, Izzie wanted to tell Callie but George insisted that it be kept a secret.\n\nWhile dealing with the aftermath of her sexual encounter with George, Izzie was visited by the adoptive parents of the child she had given up years before. Hannah, now , is sick with leukemia and her donor for a bone marrow transplant had died the previous night. Izzie asked if she could meet Hannah, her parents agreed if Hannah wanted to. Izzie agreed to donate bone marrow to save her daughter's life, causing her emotional grief, Dr. Bailey helped Izzie keep her daughter a secret from the other interns and helped her during the beginning of the bone marrow harvest. Hannah's parents informed Izzie that Hannah was tired and maybe Izzie could meet Hannah when she was better. Despite this, Izzie still agreed to donate bone marrow. George noticed Izzie crying earlier and went to find her. He stayed with her for the rest of the harvest, setting aside other emotions. In the recovery room, Izzie confides in George that she has a daughter and says she needs their friendship to survive even though the sex wasn't tragic like the encounter with him and Meredith. George was still conflicted with his feelings for Izzie and his guilt in betraying Callie, he left Izzie crying in the room, only to return once he realized Izzie needed help as a friend. George came with Izzie when she saw her daughter for the first time, noting that [[Hannah Klein|Hannah]] had Izzie's eyes and mouth.\n\n[[Image:x-.JPG|thumb|left|px|right|Izzie, Meredith and George at Christmas.]]\n\nFollowing this, Izzie and George pretended that everything was fine, and continued to spend time together as friends. As Callie became more suspicious, she confronted Izzie and begged her to relinquish George which prompted Izzie to guiltily withdraw from him. She and George both realized they couldn't pretend their sexual encounter never happened, especially because their feelings for each other keep getting in the way. The combination of all these factors leads George to decide to transfer to Mercy West.\n\nAfter George received a letter telling him he'd been accepted to [[Mercy West Medical Center]], pending the results of the intern exam, Izzie tried to convince him not to leave by saying she had no romantic feelings towards him. Izzie later admitted to George that she was in love with him, leaving him speechless.\n\n[[George O'Malley|George]] later admitted he loved Izzie too, despite his strange reaction to her when she confessed her love to him. Their relationship was soon discovered by George's wife, [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and the two got a divorce. After some time, George and Izzie realized that their relationship was not working as they had very little chemistry. They broke up but continued to have a close friendship.\n\n\n[[Robbie Stevens]]\n[[File:xIzziesmom.png|thumb|xpx|Izzie and her mother hug.]]\nWhen Izzie was diagnosed with cancer, her mother Robbie visited the hospital, unaware of how bad the cancer was. Before she left, she said to Izzie that she always knew she was too good for the trailer park. Izzie said she loved her mother, but they work better at a distance.<ref name=\":\">[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]], x</ref> She later went to live with her mother in Chehalis for a few months in the Winter after she left Alex. \n\nGrammy \nHer grandmother had a tumor on her thyroid and eventually died of thyroid cancer.<ref>[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]], x</ref>\n\n\nIzzie quickly befriended her fellow interns, [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], and [[George O'Malley]]. She bonded fastest with George. After a rough start with Alex, she became friends with him too.\n\nAfter her marriage, Izzie decided to introduce him to her patient friends: Austin, Star, Miguel, Meg, and Alison. Izzie bonded well with [[ Alison Clark|Alison]], who was similar to Izzie. They had similar cancer, age, and treatment plans. On discovering Alison decided against surgery for her brain metastases and discovering the IL- therapy was working, Izzie was torn between having surgery or not. She tried to get the opinion of Alex, Cristina, Meredith, and George. Cristina and Meredith did not agree with the surgery. With IL- therapy, after three months, the mets were gone. Alex said their life together was at stake and eventually urged for the surgery, however. After Alison's death, Izzie signed a DNR and went through surgery. Webber, Bailey and Cristina ignored the DNR order by Izzie and attempted to resuscitate her when she crashed.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Image:Illness.png|thumb|right|px|right|Izzie's (incorrect) test results.]]\nShe attended [[University of Washington School of Medicine]].\n\nAt the beginning of her internship, Izzie struggled with others' assumptions of her as an incompetent doctor, due to the fact that she used to be a lingerie model.\n\nIzzie was a reasonably good doctor but when she cut Denny Duquette's [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire, she was going to be suspended but instead quit. [[Alex Karev]] later convinced [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] to talk to Izzie and make her come back which Bailey succeeded in doing. Bailey convinced the Chief to let her return but with a strict probation which doesn't allow her to have contact with patients and an inferiority to her fellow interns. Izzie became dissatisfied with the limited amount of medical work she could do and frequently tried to push the boundaries of her probation. She even donated most of her money from [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette's]] check to a free clinic where she and Bailey often worked.\n\nDuring an emergency involving a ferry accident, Izzie saved a man's life by drilling burr holes into his skull with an ordinary drill in the field. This prompted an impressed chief to take her off probation and allow her to finish the rest of the procedure by drilling more burr holes but this time with a real high-speed surgical drill.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] told [[Richard Webber]] that Izzie had the potential to be an extremely gifted [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]], one of the best she had seen in years but she was worried because she seemed to get too close to her patients. After using a tactic of assigning Izzie to a patient that would inevitably die, Izzie left obstetrics.\n\n[[File:Off probation.jpg|thumb|left|px|Izzie is off probation.]]\n\nIzzie decided to try going into cardiothoracic surgery but was met by a determined [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], who was also trying to make a career in the same department. She eventually decided that she was not suited for the specialty and stopped pursuing it.\n\nAfter Bailey realized she had too many things to look after, she handed over the keys of the clinic to Izzie, giving it to her.\n\nWhen her interns (and the others) started to dislike being doctors since they were banned from surgery, Izzie set up a competition, won by Lexie. When she realized that Denny appearing was because she was sick, the set up a competition to diagnose patient X. When she discovered that she had cancer and other people started to learn, she finally admitted herself as a patient, she just designed Meredith and Derek's wedding and was quizzed on medical trivia by Bailey.\n\nShe quickly got back on her feet and continued working as a surgeon, although some thought it was too soon and after concerns from Owen Hunt, Derek Shepherd and Alex, Izzie was fired during the merger with Mercy West, although the chief used the standard speech and claimed it was due to budget cutbacks. After this Izzie left a note in Alex's cubby and left him.\n\nShe relocated to Baldwin City, Kansas and became a [[Surgical Oncology|surgical oncologist]].\n\n\n*She is an excellent baker and obsessive cleaner.\n*She can't cook, as revealed when she plans a Thanksgiving dinner for her roommates, relying on internet recipes.\n* She is Catholic.\n* Her glove size is .\n*Izzie says she always chooses the dog piece when she plays Monopoly.\n* She enjoys baking her mother's chocolate cupcakes and finds out the secret ingredient is coconut extract.\n*Izzie only ever sees Denny when she hallucinates, as he is the person she associates most with death.\n*From the original interns, Izzie is the only female one who did not sleep with an attending.

Bailey]]\n}}\n'''Joe''' is the owner of the [[Emerald City Bar]], across from the [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital|hospital]], where the doctors often go for a drink after work.\n\n\n\nHe was born and raised in [[Seattle]], Washington.\n\nJoe, and another child, Larry, were always in competition with each other, as were their mothers. When they were in preschool, it was who brought home the best finger painting. When they were nine, it was who could assemble the Lego castle the fastest. In high school, it was who could get a date to the prom first, and upon graduating, it was who could get into the better college. They both ended up going to U-Dub. After opening their own bars, the competition was whose bar was the most successful, which has been going on ever since. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nJoe was at the bar the night Derek and Meredith met. He served them their drinks and watched as they talked. ''(\"[[Time Has Come Today]]\")''\n\n\nJoe collapsed one day on the floor of his bar. He walked across the street to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a basal artery aneurysm. To clip the aneurysm, Derek and Burke planned a stand-still surgery. Joe didn't want the surgery because he was concerned about the cost. He feared he would not be able to keep his bar which was his life. Joe had had his bar for fourteen years. Luckily, [[George O'Malley]] was able to convince the Chief to have Joe's surgery funded by donating his body to science and qualifying him for a research grant since he would be briefly \"dead\", allowing him to keep the bar. ''(\"[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\")''\n\n\nAfter confessing her love to Derek and asking him to choose her, Meredith went to the bar and asked Joe if he believed Derek would pick her. He was sure Derek would pick her. ''(\"[[Bring the Pain]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith waited for Derek and got progressively more drunk, the news of a train crash caused all the doctors to get paged. Joe turned on the news so they could see what had happened. He tried to convince Meredith to stay for a cup of coffee before going to the hospital. Shortly after she left, Derek walked in and Joe broke the news that Meredith had left. ''(\"[[Into You Like a Train]]\")''\n\n\nJoe watched as Cristina and Izzie counted up the money they'd made selling tickets to Shane's surgery. ''(\"[[Something to Talk About]]\")''\n\n\nJoe attending Thanksgiving dinner at [[Meredith's House]]. He brought along his boyfriend, [[Walter]], whom the doctors had not previously met. He also brought a pie to share. He and Walter stayed despite most of the guests not showing up on time, but eventually had to leave before they came because he had to open the bar. ''(\"[[Thanks for the Memories]]\")''\n\n\nAfter a long day of surgery, Derek came to the bar, where Joe poured him a drink without even asking what he wanted. ''(\"[[Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the residents were at the bar comparing stories to see who was having the worst day, Joe observed and prompted Izzie when it was her turn. He then had to break up a fight that occurred when [[Nurse Kate]] poured a drink on [[Cristina Yang]]. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nAfter visiting her father, Meredith ended up at Joe's to get a drink. Mark came in and sat down next to her. ''(\"[[Yesterday]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was trying to be celibate, she came to Joe's, but didn't drink. Instead, she was knitting a sweater. Joe said that she was scaring the customers by knitting. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the interns were at the bar, Izzie and Alex exchanged insults. When Izzie called Alex a gynecologist disparagingly, Joe laughed. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie baked muffins to cope with Denny's death, she brought two baskets of them to the bar for Joe. Addison ate one basket of muffins while she got drunk and at the end of the day, Joe called Addison a cab per her instructions. ''(\"[[I Am a Tree]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie came into the bar to meet with [[Dennison Duquette, Sr.|Denny's father]], Joe pointed him out to her. ''(\"[[What I Am]]\")''\n\n\nJoe and Walter went on a camping trip with several of the male doctors. During the camping trip, he discussed his relationship with Walter with Richard Webber and they bonded over some similarities. Later, when Walter was injured, Joe held his hand while he got stitches. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\n\nAfter George's dad died, Alex went to the bar. Joe asked him about Harold and Alex informed him that Harold had died. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nwhen Meredith drowned in [[Elliott Bay]], Cristina left the hospital and went to the dollar store and then to the bar, where she talked to Joe as she got drunk, thinking Meredith would die. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nJoe and Walter decided to have kids and put in an application to adopt. They met up with [[Rina]], who was deciding between them and another couple to adopt her baby. They took her to get prenatal care because she hadn't had any and an ultrasound revealed twins. Later, while Walter was taking her to the bus station, Rina started having severe chest pain, so he brought her back to the bar, where she collapsed and was taken back to the ER. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nIn the ER, [[Preston Burke]] took over her care and said she'd need surgery for an aortic dissection, which meant the babies would probably be born that day. They took her into the OR, where the babies were quickly delivered and Burke repaired her heart. After her surgery, she was stable and awake. Walter and Joe sat by her bedside as they held their newborn twins. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nAs part of Callie and Mark's pact not to sleep with any interns, they agreed to sit at the bar and stare at Joe, which freaked Joe out. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Archer Montgomery|Archer's]] surgery was successful, Addison, Sam, Naomi, Mark, and Derek came to the bar to celebrate. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\nWhen their celebrating continued into the next morning, Joe pointed that out to them. ''(\"[[Ex-Life]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the stress of the merger, Richard started drinking again and Joe served him. ''(\"[[New History]]\")''\n\nWhen Richard became drunk on New Year's Day, Joe called Meredith to come take care of him. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n\nJoe was present when a camera crew filmed a documentary about the doctors at the hospital. He gave interviews on his point of view of the doctors. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Cristina quit her residency, Owen told her to get a job, so she went to work at the bar. Joe quickly became frustrated with her as she was a terrible bartender. He ultimately fired her. ''(\"[[Slow Night, So Long]]\")''\n\n\nHe enjoys listening to other people's problems, keeping the peace, breaking up fights over games of pool and darts, babysitting drunk employees of Seattle Grace, controlling the flow of alcohol as well as the TV remote. He also enjoys movies, television, exercising (in small doses), and almost any outdoor activity.\n\nJoe is very friendly to his customers, one of the many reasons many of the hospital staff go there.\n\n\n\n[[Walter]]\nOn a camping trip, Joe revealed during a discussion with the Chief that although he and [[Walter]] had been \"on-and-off\" for about ten years, they were now committed and considering the possibility of children, but Walter said he didn't want to raise kids alone because Joe was always working at the bar. However, Joe said that he loved Walter so much that if he needed to make a change, he would. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\nThey were one of two couples being considered as adoptive parents for a young mother's twins.\n\nJoe and [[Walter]] also attended the Thanksgiving [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] hosted at [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] house, and went on a camping trip with Drs. [[Derek Shepherd|Shepherd]], [[Preston Burke|Burke]], [[Richard Webber|Webber]], [[Alex Karev|Karev]] and [[George O'Malley|O'Malley]].\n\nMax\nHe dated a guy named Max for about four weeks. Prior to that, they were friends. Things ended when Joe made the mistake of talking about a hot lifeguard in front of Max. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nHe has a nephew and a niece named Samantha. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\nHe is close with his mother, who lives just down the street from him. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nJoe gets along well with most of the doctors from the hospital across the street from his bar.\n\n[[Debbie]]\nHe and Debbie are best friends. During the first annual Emerald City Bar Darts Tournament, Joe's partner flaked on him, and Debbie volunteered to be his partner. Her dart skills brought her and Joe up to semifinals, where they lost. Joe congratulated Debbie on her dart skills and she thanked him for taking her mind off work. While munching on peanuts, they began to gossip about people they both know. Joe likes to say that they bonded over darts, but Debbie says that they share a common love for gossip. They have been best friends ever since.\ua''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\nEric\nHe has a friend named Eric who sustained a head injury from the [[Dead Baby Bike Race]]. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nWhen Bailey was an intern, she spent a lot of time in the bar talking to Joe. He told her she was worth something, not that he knew anything about it. He gave her confidence. She described him as the only one who really knew her at the time.\ua''(\"[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\")'' ''(\"[[The Time Warp]]\")''\n\n\nBefore befriending the other interns of his class, Alex hung out at the bar a lot with Joe becoming his only friend.\n\n\nHe owns and runs [[Emerald City Bar]], which is across the street from [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He's owned the bar for over  years.\n\n\n*He has an official blog, [http://www.emeraldcitybar.com/]\n*He is  years old.<ref>[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]</ref>\n*He minored in German in college.<ref>[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]</ref>\n*His favorite drink is the Irish Car Bomb.

Izzie and Cristina did a paracentesis to drain the fluid. They were nervous about the procedure as neither of them had done one before, but they did it anyway. They drained a significant amount of fluid and then noticed that he had no pulse. They called a code, but they were unable to save him.\n\nWorried that they might have done something wrong, they did an autopsy even though they were unable to convince the family to ask for one. Bailey interrupted their autopsy, but by then, they'd discovered that his heart was enlarged. They took a sample of the grainy material inside his heart to run tests. They discovered hemochromatosis, which had caused his death and had made him sick for many years prior to then.

''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural to practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nLeo, Sadie, and Megan all had to work with Izzie in the clinic for a day. When they did procedures on patients, she also had them perform them on her. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns worked on Patient X (actually Izzie using her own scans and labs) and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. Leo got in trouble for making fun of the patient. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended Alex and Izzie's wedding. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen George died, Leo attended the funeral. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program.\n\nCristina had Pierce, Megan, and Leo spy on the Chief for her and report back what they saw. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nLeo was one of [[Izzie Stevens]]' interns. Since he was never seen again after the first round of cutbacks, it's likely he was part of the / of his class cut.

But I still love you, whether you are capable of letting me or not. So, I forgive you.|'''Lexie Grey''' to '''[[Meredith Grey]]'''}}\n\n'''Lexie Grey''' was the daughter of [[Susan Grey|Susan]] and [[Thatcher Grey]] and half-sister of [[Meredith Grey]]. She was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] until she died in the [[Plane Crash|plane crash]]. After her death, the hospital was renamed after her and [[Mark Sloan]], the two fatal casualties from the plane crash.\n\n\n\nLexie was the daughter of [[Thatcher Grey]] and his second wife, [[Susan Grey|Susan]]. She had a younger sister, [[Molly Thompson|Molly Grey-Thompson]]. She also had an older half-sister [[Meredith Grey]], born to Thatcher and his ex-wife [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]], a famed surgeon. As a child, she was bright and skipped third grade. When she turned seven, her parents threw her a surprise party, which she always remembered as one of her best birthdays. She was very popular in high school, having a great group of friends, being crowned prom queen, and being class valedictorian. Near the end of Meredith's intern year, Thatcher mentioned to Meredith that Lexie was in medical school and that she soon had to choose a residency spot.\n\n\nWhen her mother Susan died of complications of the hiccups, Thatcher took to drinking and soon became an alcoholic. Despite this, Lexie stayed with her father and continued to care for him, even though he would often unreasonably and randomly lash out at Lexie.\n\nBy the time of Susan's death, both Lexie and Molly knew about Meredith's existence, though Lexie had never met Meredith before. On the day of her mother's funeral, Lexie waited in the car while Thatcher, accompanied by Molly, went to tell Meredith that she wasn't welcome at Susan's funeral, again missing the opportunity to see her older half-sister. After the funeral, Lexie went to Joe's bar where she offered to buy Derek a drink. He was visibly charmed and called her forward, to which she replied that she had a bad day, so she got to be forward today. He confessed to having had a bad day too but decided not to have a drink with her because he was there with some friends. They both agreed it was too bad, showing interest in one another.<ref>[[Testing --]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs Lexie started her internship, she met [[George O'Malley]] while he was cleaning out his locker in the interns' locker room. They quickly bonded and became friends. They even [[The Crapartment|moved in together]] after George's relationship with Callie ended. Lexie started having feelings for George, which he did not reciprocate. She called him out for not treating her better while she had always been there for him.\n\n\nWhen Lexie found out that she had a sister through her father, she began to have fantasies of getting along with her. Soon, she went to [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]] for her residency in hopes of meeting her. While Meredith did not appreciate Lexie's presence at first, over time, Meredith eventually tolerated her and accepted her as a sister. Lexie also confronted Meredith about her mistreatment of her on quite a few occasions, all with the good intentions of letting Meredith get to know her. After a very long time, Meredith began to care about her, and eventually admitted that she loved Lexie.\n\n\nWhile not part of the original group of interns practicing on each other, Lexie [[Rise Up|caught]] her fellow interns under Yang performing simple procedures on each other. Initially creeped out by the thought, Lexie tried to get cadavers for them to practice on, instead, but even these were stolen by their residents. Realizing that she wasn't learning enough from Cristina, she eventually joined the secret intern society, and the group soon grew as more dissatisfied interns joined.\n\nWhen Cristina and Meredith [[These Ties That Bind|suspected]] that she was cutting herself, she tried to shut down the group temporarily but was quelled by the new and enthusiastic member [[Sadie Harris]]. They were eventually found out by Cristina, who let them off with a warning. When Sadie told her that Meredith thought she was a priss, Lexie [[In the Midnight Hour|suggested]] that they perform an appendectomy on [[Steve Mostow|Steve]], who disapproved, but Sadie volunteered to take his place. However, the operation went wrong and she went to Meredith for help. After being discovered by the [[Richard Webber|Chief]], she and all the involved interns were put on probation by their residents and banned from surgeries.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Lexie and George]]\nLexie met George at the end of his first year as an intern,<ref>[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]], x</ref> and kept it a secret when she found out George failed his intern exam and had to repeat his intern year. They became good friends and even rented an apartment together. Lexie, however, began to see George as more than a friend, and while they became incredibly close, George did not see her the same way, so Lexie was constantly disappointed by George's lack of response to her signals and seeming unawareness to her feelings. \n\n\nLexie first came up to Alex one night when they were leaving the hospital. She initially asks for something more and Alex catches on and tells her that he's not that kind of guy. He tells her that he's the guy that people go to for the one-nighters and solely for the sex. Eventually, they do have it, in Alex's room that he's living in under Meredith's roof. She catches them in the act which unnerves Alex a bit. Later on, we occasionally see the two exchange kisses from time to time and go out to Joe's. In the resident locker room, Alex is caught in a 'feud' between the sisters. He says he won't continue messing around with Lexie because he doesn't want to be a part of their quarrel. Saying that he's not taking a side by refraining from messing around with Lexie, she says he clearly is. Then, Ava comes claiming she wants to see Alex perform surgery. He finds her a pair of scrubs and allows her to sit on the observatory deck while he surgically removes a man's sternum with the help of Dr. Hahn and Dr. Sloan. Lexie meets Ava and asks if she's here for Sloan, but Ava says no, she's here for Alex. She asks Lexie if she knew Alex and Lexie replies with \"No, I have no idea who he is.\"\n\n\nTo Mark, Lexie was \"forbidden fruit\", because she was Meredith's little sister and a \"fetus\", due to their large age gap. That's how she got her nickname '''Little Grey'''. Lexie came up to Mark and told him that the other interns were trying to take their mind off their so-called secret intern surgeries by having sex, but instead, she wanted to learn and asked him to teach her. Mark thought this was inappropriate, but let her be on his service on \"cappuccino duty\". Later that day, Lexie came up to his hotel room, took off her clothes, and said, \"Teach me\".\n\n\nMark and Lexie's relationship started to get troubled when [[Sloan Riley]], Mark's pregnant -year-old daughter, turned up at the hospital. Despite having a distant relationship with Sloan, Mark grew to become a caring father for his daughter. Since she was not ready to be a good mother for her baby on her own, Mark offered her to move in with him permanently so they could raise the baby together. Lexie confronted him and told him that she was not ready to start a family and be a grandmother yet. He begged her not to make him choose between his daughter and grandson and her, because, as Lexie figured, he'd choose for his daughter and grandson. This caused her to end the relationship with him.\n\n\nAfter Mark and Lexie broke up, she began a short relationship with Alex when she moved back into Meredith's house. They hooked up that day since Alex was missing Izzie as well. The relationship did not last long, however, as Lexie soon got back together with Mark.\n\n\nShortly before the shooting, Mark realized his feelings for Lexie. After Teddy broke things off with him, Callie told him that his jealousy was showing and was a sign he still loved her. He confessed his love for her and told her that she should choose him instead of Alex since he would marry her. She didn't have much of a response since Alex interrupted Mark's confession.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref> During the shooting, Mark and Lexie worked together to save Alex, who had been shot. Lexie told Alex she loved him, but Alex asked for Izzie, confused.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref> Ultimately, the two broke up. After the shooting, Mark took care of her and told Callie that he wanted to marry Lexie, but she persuaded him not to go to Lexie and propose.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref> Lexie thought that Mark's drive to bring her away from the OR was since he thought she wasn't stable after the shooting, but April told her that it was because he loved her. Lexie went to find Mark but found him kissing [[Amelia Shepherd]].<ref>[[Superfreak]], x</ref> Later on, Mark asked Lexie for a drink, which Lexie did her best to avoid. Even though she tried not to, Lexie went to Joe's and kissed Mark, which starts their relationship again.\n\n\nWhen Lexie broke up with Mark, she was feeling hurt and started a relationship with [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] until he realized that she obviously still had feelings for Mark. Unwilling to wait for her, he broke up with her.\n\n\nWhen Meredith and Derek agreed that the solution to their relationship troubles was for Meredith to stop being on his service, Lexie took her place as his resident. Hence, Lexie spent a significant amount of time on Derek's service. She was initially intimidated by Derek due to his exacting standards and quirks, once even asking Meredith to go \"have sex with him and make him nicer.\" Meredith would give her tips on how to get on his good side. Lexie and Derek tackled a number of hopeless cases together. \n\n\nShe was on a plane that crashed with [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], going to another hospital for surgery to separate conjoined twins. Suddenly, the back of the plane broke off and the plane crashed in the woods.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Mark finds Lexie trapped under the plane.]]\n\nA piece of the plane landed on top of her, crushing her pelvis and legs. Separated from the others, who were in the front part of the plane, she used a belt and knocked it against the piece of plane crushing her. Meredith, Cristina, and Mark followed the sound and found her. They concluded she was still awake and responsive, and an emotional Meredith went off to find Derek, who was still missing. Mark and Cristina tried to lift up the part of the plane, but without success. Lexie told Cristina her legs and pelvis were crushed and was doubtful if her left arm was still there. Mark yelled at Cristina to go get fluids and oxygen tanks from the plane, and even though both she and Lexie realized that Lexie was dying, she left to get the supplies.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Mark telling Lexie he loves her.]]\n\nWhile waiting for Cristina to come back, Lexie asked Mark to hold her hand and tell Meredith that she was a good sister. She also wanted him to tell something to her father, but Mark refused as he didn't want to accept that she was going to die. After once again unsuccessfully trying to lift the part of the plane on his own, he realized there was nothing he could do for her, and he did take her hand. He confessed that he loved her, and Lexie said that he didn't have to say it just because she did, but he insisted that he loved her. They fantasized about how they would get married and have kids, specifically a sister and two brothers, as siblings for Sofia. Mark said she couldn't die, as they were supposed to end up together. He told her that they were meant to be. \"Meant to be,\" she repeated with a smile. She then succumbed to her injuries, and a crying Mark closed her eyes with his one hand as he kept on holding her hand in his other hand. Seconds later, Meredith and Cristina appeared and they mourned her death together.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nTogether with the survivors, Lexie's body was taken out of the woods and transported back to Seattle. Cristina once told Owen about the nights in the woods, when she heard animals fighting and growling. She told him that she realized that they were fighting over Lexie's body and that she did her best to try and keep them off of her.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nDay of the Dead\nLexie was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nCovid-  Beach\nLexie appeared on Meredith's beach while she fought for her life. Lexie was joined by [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and together they tried to convince Meredith why she should keep living and not die.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and Lexie talk at Joe's.]]\nLexie came to Seattle for her mother's funeral and after, she went to Joe's. Like her sister, she met her future brother-in-law [[Derek Shepherd]] there and later discovered he worked at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\nVoted student body president, Lexie was popular by both peers and teachers at school. Her photographic memory also made her one of the brightest in her class and not only made her a natural in the OR but also meant she knew all the periodic elements which she tells Mark Sloan when having a drink at Joe's bar.\n\nAs an intern, Lexie was portrayed to be emotionally fragile and incapable of lying or covering up. She coped with her anxiety by rambling incessantly or snacking compulsively. She was liked by the attendings for her knowledge and good instincts, but her residents generally treated her as a scut monkey or their encyclopedia.\n\n\n\nWhen Carolyn Shepherd came to Seattle, she asked Lexie how many sexual partners she had, to which she replied that she had six or seven.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nLexie made her first appearance in Seattle Grace when she introduced herself to George.\n\nLexie learned that George was repeating his intern year and helped him keep the other interns unaware of his failure. She and George developed an unlikely friendship over intern struggles and their strained relationships with Meredith and Callie, respectively. Lexie was shown to have been smitten with George. Mark Sloan noticed this and vowed to be less mean to George if she'd admit her feelings to him. As a result, Mark was slightly more polite to the two of them and George misunderstood, thinking Lexie and Mark were sleeping together. Lexie continued to vie for George's affections.\n\nGeorge finally passed his intern exam and seemed to pay less attention to Lexie. The final straw occurred when he received his new interns and Lexie discovers he hadn't had the decency to even ask to have her assigned to him. She broke down in front of him, calling herself stupid and him a jerk. Lexie chose to forgive George and made a peace offering, keeping her feelings for him quiet.\n\nAs George was retaking his intern year and only Lexie knew, the two bonded and became best friends. Having parties with fellow interns such as [[Graciella Guzman|Graciella]], [[Megan Nowland|Megan]], [[Steve Mostow|Steve]], [[Pierce Halley|Pierce]], [[Claire (Intern)|Claire]], and later [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]]. She also moved in with George but later moved out when she felt lonely. Mark then insisted that Derek take her home.\n\n[[File:TeachMe(AllByMyself).jpg|thumb|left|Lexie undresses and asks Mark to \"teach her\".]]\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhile working with Mark Sloan, she developed an attraction, intensified by Derek's ban on them going out. Mark himself was initially reluctant out of loyalty to Derek, as she was the sister of his best friend's wife and their age gap. One night, Lexie went to his hotel room, stripped and says \"''teach me''\", they began a secret relationship. They grew close very quickly and Mark developed true feelings for her, but Lexie was tired of the secrecy and put their relationship on hold. Eventually, Mark told Derek and they began dating in public. Their relationship hit a small bump when Mark decided he did not want to go to dinner with her and Thatcher because fathers didn't like him, but in the end, he went. Another slightly larger bump happened when he suggested she move in with him into a condo he was considering buying, but she didn't think she was ready because she was so young. The conversation turned intensely awkward when Mark accidentally brought up marriage. Lexie told him that in five years she'd still be a resident, and he replied that there were plenty of residents that were married.\n\nWhen Derek performed a 'rogue surgery' on a patient with a highly complex \"inoperable\" spinal tumor and Lexie wanted to take part, Mark encouraged her with a huge smile and said \"''Go get your rogue on''.\", which hinted that they were in a committed relationship. When Mark's -year-old daughter, [[Sloan Riley]] arrives, she's supportive, even better than he was with dealing with it. But later on, she proves to have some difficulty when his daughter reveals she is pregnant and Mark offers to let her stay as long as she wants in him and Lexie will be there for her, entirely not consulting Lexie on the matter. And her being a grandmother at  is way too much for her to take, after an argument about it later, he asks her not to make him choose between her and Sloan (his daughter) Lexie asks \"''Why because you'll choose her?''\" and Mark responds \"''Yeah''.\" And Lexie says, tearfully, ''\"I think our relationship just ended''.\" Then she goes to Meredith's house and gets drunk, and has a discussion with Alex, leading to her sleeping with him. She later discovers that Mark slept with Addison, and he discovers she slept with Alex. He becomes angry at her for this.\n\nLexie began to date Alex after his divorce with Izzie. She becomes jealous when she finds out Mark slept with Reed. Later Mark tells her he still loves her, to which she replies \"''I have a boyfriend,''\" Mark tells her ''<nowiki>\"'</nowiki>'''I know. '''''I'm just saying you could have a husband.\" When the shooting happened, Mark and Lexie tended to Alex's shot wound. During this, Lexie told Alex she loved him, much to Mark's disappointment. Alex left Lexie after her breakdown, and Mark took Lexie to the psych ward. At Joe's, April tells Lexie that Mark loves her, that's why he always stares at her. Lexie then goes to his apartment, applies her makeup in the elevator, then is crushed to see him making out with Derek's sister, Amelia. Lexie and Mark continue to flirt. One day, he tells her he misses her. Then she asks him to talk to a nurse who hates her, to which he is willing to exchange for one drink. Upon seeing which nurse it is, he makes it two. She tells him \"''Fine''\" That night and tells Jackson to come in during the date telling her he needs her for something as an excuse to leave the date. Lexie arrives at Joe's later, tells him that it isn't fair for either of them since Mark is at a different point in her life than Lexie. Mark responds by simply kissing her, she kisses him back. Jackson arrives to pull her out of her date, and Lexie tells him to go, and she continues to kiss Mark. What Lexie doesn't know, is that Mark had a one night stand with Callie during their breakup, and Callie is now pregnant with his child. When Mark tells Lexie, she looks at him with disbelief and then storms out of his apartment. Mark wants to make things right, but Lexie won't talk to him, so he arranges for Jackson to find out what's bothering Lexie, in exchange for scrubbing in on his surgery. Lexie, with tears in her eyes, spills the beans to Jackson about how Mark has left her behind once again and does not care about how she feels. Jackson decides not to tell Mark because he feels like Lexie told him this in good faith.\n\nShe begins a relationship with Jackson but ends because he realizes she is in love with Mark. Mark was dating a doctor from another hospital, which made Lexie jealous. Lexie tries to tell Mark she still loves him, and after many fails, she does it, but he doesn't respond. When the plane crashes, and Lexie is about to die, Mark asks her to marry him, and says they will have children, after hearing this, Lexie dies.\n\nWhen Mark returns to the hospital, after the plane crash, Julia, his girlfriend was waiting for him, and she says she loves him, but he responds, \"I loved Lexie.\"\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nSince Mark was still in love with Lexie, he recruited Jackson and bribed him with surgery in exchange for information about Lexie. Jackson, however, began to have feelings for Lexie and the two began dating. Lexie told Mark that she was seeing someone else when they were at Callie's baby shower. He asked if it was someone he knew, but Lexie walked away. Eventually, Mark figured it out once the two went public with their relationship. Lexie and Jackson's relationship became complicated as Mark was Jackson's mentor and it became clear to Jackson that Lexie was still in love with Mark. Jackson ended it with Lexie, saying that he, \"chooses Mark\".\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex and Lexie slept together once when she first became an intern at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Then they later had a relationship that lasted until he called out for [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] after being shot and she was committed to the psych ward in the aftermath of the shooting.\n\n\n[[Thatcher Grey]]\nThatcher was a good father to Lexie, contrary to how he was with Meredith. As Meredith said, Lexie \"never saw his bad side.\" Even as Lexie discovered the way Thatcher treated Meredith, she still loved him. She protected Thatcher's reputation during his alcoholism following [[Susan Grey|Susan's]] death. Each time he visited [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], she was warm to him. She was annoyed when he began dating again. However, Meredith eventually told Lexie it wasn't worth being angry over.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith took an instant dislike to her half-sister, Lexie, upon her arrival. Meredith truly hated the enthusiasm Lexie showed trying to get to know her. Meredith, however, quickly realized that although she had reason to hate the idea of her, she had no reason to hate Lexie herself.\n\nInitially, she didn't like the way Lexie followed her or spoke to Derek about her. She claimed that Lexie was someone she never wanted to know, even trying to deny that Lexie was her sister. After a traumatic day, Cristina brought Lexie to Meredith's with her and Meredith made an effort to bond with her and they danced and drank tequila. The next morning, Meredith even tried to make breakfast for her, and Lexie was so enthusiastic that she ate it, despite knowing she would have an allergic reaction to the eggs.\n\nLexie and Meredith didn't get too close, as Meredith was over a surgical year older and they had two different sets of friends. As [[George O'Malley|George]] and Lexie's friendship phased out, Lexie gave up the apartment that the two of them had shared. She moved into the attic of Meredith's house, where she occasionally bemoaned the fact that she didn\ut have a proper room instead.\n\nOnce George died and Izzie left the hospital, the remaining residents became very close. Meredith and Lexie became so close that Meredith gave Thatcher a piece of her liver so that Lexie wouldn't lose her dad because Lexie wasn't a match.\n\nShe also sat with Lexie for  hours after she had a PTSD breakdown following the shooting and had to be committed to the psychiatric ward. After Meredith's miscarriage, Lexie got jealous over how April was close with Meredith. Lexie was ashamed over her jealousy, but Meredith was flattered and told her, \"You're not crazy, Lexie. You're a Grey.\"\n\nWhen the plane crashed, Lexie died as a result of the injuries she sustained and upon hearing this, Meredith cried hysterically.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref> While treating a patient who had similar injuries, Meredith obsessed over saving the patient's life. After successfully saving the woman, Meredith was talking to Cristina and simply said that \"Lexie's dead\". From this, it appears that Meredith has accepted the fact that Lexie is gone and is at peace.<ref>[[Beautiful Doom]], x</ref>\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nDerek and Lexie's bond actually began romantically. Right after the funeral for her mother and before Lexie began her internship at Seattle Grace, she actually asked Derek if she could buy him a drink. She, of course, did not know he was Meredith's at the time boyfriend.<ref>[[Testing --]], x</ref> This did not cause any roadblocks because as soon as Lexie realized who Derek was, she backed right off.  \n\nUnlike Meredith, Derek accepted Lexie as a sister from the beginning and repeatedly tried to persuade Meredith to be nice to her. Lexie saw him as a big brother and would seek his advice, often at the most inappropriate times. He also comforted and encouraged her after they were forced to send home a terminally ill young boy after discovering in surgery that his cancer was too advanced for them to help.<ref>[[Hope for the Hopeless]], x</ref>\n\n[[Zola Grey Shepherd]]\nZola is Lexie's niece. She babysat Zola while Meredith and Derek went out on [[All You Need is Love|Valentine's Day]] and presumably other various times. Lexie also referred to Zola as her \"favorite little niece\". Before she died, Meredith and Derek's will stated that Lexie would become Zola's legal guardian if her parents died.\n\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\nLexie developed a short friendship with [[Sadie Harris]] when she covered for Lexie, saying that she (Sadie) gave Mark Sloan a penile fracture, even though it was actually Lexie. She later guarded the door so Lexie could visit Mark in his room.\n\n\n[[File:Lexiewins.jpg|thumb|right|px|Lexie wins the intern competition.]]\nLexie graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]]. She aced her [[Psychiatry|psych]] [[Clerkship|clerkship]].\n\nShe was accepted into Seattle Grace's [[General Surgery|Surgical]] [[Resident|Residency Program]], choosing Seattle Grace over [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She was assigned to surgical resident [[Cristina Yang]]. Lexie was considered the best of the interns and she even won the intern competition set up by Izzie.\n\nIn her fourth (and subsequently final) year of residency, Lexie took an interest in [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgery]] and often rotated on Derek's service, tackling several cases that were deemed inoperable by other neurosurgeons.\n\n\n*She was allergic to eggs, but loved avocados.<ref>[[Lay Your Hands on Me]], x</ref>\n*She hated apples and thought they shouldn't be allowed to be fruits, but she liked apple juice.<ref>[[Physical Attraction...

Chemical Reaction]], x</ref>\n*She loved peanut butter cups and french fries.\n*Meredith and Derek named Lexie Zola's legal guardian in their will if anything should happen to them while she was still alive.\n*When her mother died unexpectedly, she snuck into a graveyard to bury her mother's previously deceased cat beside her.\n*She had a \"Photographic Memory\" which helped her through medical school.\n*She was a binge eater when she was stressed.<ref>[[Sweet Surrender]], x</ref>\n**Near the end of [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season five]], Lexie's excessive eating was part of a private joke between the cast due to [[Chyler Leigh|Chyler Leigh's]] pregnancy. Most shots with Chyler had her stomach covered.\n*Curiously, Lexie's lab coat has Lexie Grey embroidered on it, while she was officially named Alexandra. Other characters with shortened names, such as Callie and Izzie, have their official name embroidered on their lab coats.\n**This is also the case with [[Ben Warren|Ben Warren's]] lab coat.\n*In her fourth year of residency, Lexie began to show interest in [[neurosurgery]] and assisted [[Derek Shepherd]] in many of his surgeries.\n*Lexie's last words were \"meant to be\".<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n*In early [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season nine]], she was featured in several flashbacks of the plane crash.\n*Lexie is the only female main character of the three shows to be killed off.\n*She liked it when someone's fingers were brushed through her hair when she was in pain, which is what Mark did when she died.\n*After her death due to the plane crash, Cristina said that she heard animals fighting over her body at night and that she tried to keep them away.\n*Her criminal record consisted of one speeding ticket,  miles over the limit. She claimed she was coasting down a hill.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Devil]], x</ref>\n*She was Valedictorian and Prom Queen in high school.<ref>[[Forever Young]], x</ref>\n*She didn't like to keep secrets.<ref>[[Beat Your Heart Out]], x</ref>\n*She has had the chickenpox vaccination.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref>\n*She was a softball pitcher.<ref>[[Put Me In, Coach]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nLexieGrey.png\nLexieGrey.png\nxLexieGrey.png\nLexieGrey.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Lexie-centric or are otherwise very informative about her life.\n*[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\n*[[All By Myself]]\n*[[P.Y.T.

She hadn't been told that Callie and George were getting divorced and she had made baby clothes. When Izzie told her that they weren't together anymore, she was upset. She confronted George and tried to get him to work things out with Callie, but he said it was too late for them. ''(\"[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]\")''\n\n\nAfter George was declared brain dead, she asked Callie to decide what to do with his organs as in God's eyes she was still George's wife and because she has too much to do including having to tell [[Ronny O'Malley|Ronny]] and [[Jerry O'Malley|Jerry]], who were on a fishing trip and unreachable. Callie accepted, but passed the duty onto Izzie, whom she felt was the person closest to George. Louise sobbed at George's funeral as he was laid to rest.

And you go from there.|'''[[Mark Sloan]]'''}}\n\n'''Mark Sloan''' was the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Plastic Surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. He is the father of [[Sloan Riley]] and [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]]. After his death, the hospital was renamed after him and [[Lexie Grey]], the two fatal casualties after the plane crash. \n\n\n\nMark was born in  to upper-class, but emotionally distant parents in [[New York|New York City]]. While working on a case involving a man's sleepwalking and his daughter's subsequent insomnia, Mark revealed that his own parents would often go out at night, leaving him to care for himself. As a result, he would turn on all the TVs and every light in the house, even those in the closets, but still couldn't sleep.\n\nLater, he revealed that he and [[Derek Shepherd]] were childhood friends and when Derek's mother, [[Carolyn Shepherd|Carolyn]], saw how lonely he was, she encouraged Derek to bring him home. This led Mark to develop a family relationship with the Shepherds, and become like a brother to Derek. When Derek's mother visited, she revealed that a -year-old Mark once put Derek's favorite frog into the microwave, to which Mark replied that he never pressed start.\n\nMark was an athlete in high school and played on the football team.\n\n\nShortly before Derek's move to Seattle, Mark and Addison were caught having sex in Derek's bedroom. According to Mark, Derek merely walked out, packed his things, and left. Derek later learned that they continued to see each other after he left. Part of the reason Mark moved to Seattle was to try to continue his relationship with Addison. Addison gave him an ultimatum: If he could go sixty days without sleeping with anyone else, she would consider dating him. However, when Mark saw Addison and [[Alex Karev]] coming out of an on-call room together, he realized that they had had sex, and lied to Addison that he had slept with someone to break the -day contract. He never revealed to Addison that he caught her.\n\n\nMark first visited Seattle to bring Addison back to New York. Shortly after arriving at Seattle Grace, Derek punched him, it is later revealed, while Meredith is cleaning his facial wound, that it was due to his even stronger feelings for Meredith rather than Addison.<ref>[[Yesterday]], x</ref>\uaMeredith and Mark only spoke to each other and Mark got punched,\uaMark and Addison had sex and Derek simply walked away and did not look back.\uaMark slept with Addison again before he intended to leave, but he stayed and became the Head of Plastic Surgery.\n\n\nMark was in the running for Chief of Surgery, along with Derek, Burke, and Addison. He got a idea from Bailey mentioning the hospital needs a \"right now\" plan, not a ten-year plan. Richard Webber told the other  that the board was eating up the \"right now\" plan, and suggested that they should do the same.<ref>[[My Favorite Mistake]], x</ref>\n\n\nMark had a sexual relationship with Callie Torres.<ref>[[What I Am]], x</ref><ref>[[Oh, the Guilt]], x</ref> Mark started flirting with Erica Hahn, which she rejected. Mark suggested having a threesome between him, Callie, and Erica. Erica said he would be intimidated by her and Callie's relationship, and kissed Callie before stepping off the elevator.<ref>[[Losing My Mind]], x</ref>\n\n\nMark and Lexie started their relationship off with Lexie going to his apartment, taking off her clothes and telling him to \"teach her.\" They then had sex. After that, Mark wanted to resist\uaLexie because of his promise to Derek but it proved futile. He and Callie tried to make a pact to not sleep with the hot surgical interns, but it falls through. At the end of the day Callie and Mark are side by side at the bar at Joe's. Mark decides he's going to pursue Lexie, but Callie still holds back from flirting with [[Sadie Harris]].\n\ua\nMark has reservations about Lexie's relative age and inexperience, but more so about breaking his promise to Derek. Especially when Derek is gearing up to propose to Meredith; Mark questions maybe breaking up with Lexie because\uahe can't sleep with any more of Derek's sisters.\n\nWhen Mark fractures his penis during sex, Lexie comforts him in the aftermath. Mark is initially humiliated and asks Lexie to leave, but after surgery they cuddle.\nLexie confronts Mark about keeping their relationship a secret. She's tired\uaof lying to the people close to her and says they need to go public.\ua\n\n\nDuring the hospital shooting, Mark and Lexie were at the nurses' station, where shots were fired by Gary Clark. Mark ran Lexie to the elevator, which had an unconscious and bloody Alex Karev in it. They brought Alex to a conference room, where they treated him until the SWAT team evacuated them.\n\n\nShortly after Arizona moved to Africa, Callie started sleeping with Mark. Callie got pregnant with Mark's baby and Mark decided he wanted to be part of this baby's life, because he didn't have the chance with his other daughter, Sloan. When Arizona came back to Seattle Grace Mercy West, she and Callie got into a car accident. Callie was badly injured. She had to have an emergency c-section at  weeks. She gave birth to a premature baby and named her Sofia. Sofia and Callie both survived. Mark helped raise Sofia with Callie and Arizona until his death.\n\n\nMark began dating an eye surgeon named Julia who worked at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]]. Once Lexie learned of this, she became jealous of their relationship. During a softball game, Julie began to taunt Lexie about her softball skills, causing Lexie to throw the softball at Julia, which injured\uaher.<ref>[[Put Me In, Coach]], x</ref>\n\nMark began taking an interest in Jackson because he wanted Jackson to choose plastic surgery as his specialty. Mark noted that Jackson was very good-looking like him, which is helpful in that field. Mark called the two of them the \"Plastics Posse.\"\n\n\nIn , while traveling to Boise, Idaho to perform a separation surgery of conjoined twins, Mark was in a [[Flight|plane crash]]. He, along with Meredith, Lexie, Cristina, Arizona, and Derek became stranded in the woods. Mark seemed to have escaped with only minor injuries at first, though after the death of Lexie, he became unresponsive. Cristina examined his chest to find major bruising. Cristina realized that he had a cardiac tamponade, fluid surrounding his heart. Meredith used a tube from a bottle that Derek and Cristina found to drain the fluid. Cristina, Meredith, and Derek were able to get Mark to the front of the plane where Arizona and the pilot were. Mark woke up and told Arizona that Lexie was dead, and that she was waiting for him. Mark tried to tell Arizona he would be okay when he died, but she told him that she, Sofia, and Callie were waiting for him, too.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nMark was airlifted to Idaho, then sedated and moved to Seattle Grace Mercy West. He spent two months declining until he woke up briefly. After that day, he fell into a coma. After thirty days, they turned the life support machines off and Derek and Callie sat with him while he died.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n\nDay of the Dead\nMark was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith's Beach\nDuring Meredith's COVID-induced coma, Mark appeared on her 'beach', alongside Lexie.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:Old-friends-again.jpg|thumb|left|px|Best friends.]]His friendship with Derek lasted throughout childhood and into their adult years and Mark was Derek's best man at his wedding to [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. He once joked that Derek is his \"better half, but not better looking half\". Their friendship was strained due to Addison's affair with Mark and the latter's relationship with [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]]. They are polar opposite personalities: Mark is usually happy-go-lucky and forgives Derek easily while Derek tends to brood and hold grudges.\n\nAs Derek and Addison's marriage became strained, Mark and Addison grew closer, and eventually Mark slept with Addison, only for Derek to catch them in the act. Derek subsequently left New York and later Addison followed suit, leaving Mark behind. He moved to Seattle to try to win them both back and in the end, he became good friends with both.\n\nAccording to his \"-dollar-an-hour shrink\", \"behind his rugged and confident exterior, he is self-destructive and self-loathing to an almost pathological degree.\" Mark has commitment issues, likely stemming from his emotionally challenged relationship with his parents, and his friendship with Derek was his single longest non-sexual relationship. He has a long history of womanizing and one-night stands, and is somewhat indiscriminate about his partners, admitting to affairs with not only Addison but also his tennis partner's wife. He has also slept with all of Derek's sisters at some point. However he generally keeps a distance from [[Meredith Grey]] out of respect for Derek, once even comforting her following her first break-up with Derek by telling her that they're now both members of the \"Dirty Mistresses\" club.\n\nMark is impatient and shows disdain for the responsibility of training interns, and \"berates and humiliates\", as described by [[Erica Hahn]]. He often had interns pick up his dry cleaning or get him coffee and mainly looked out for himself, ignoring Addison when she told him SGH was a teaching hospital. He is also intelligent and conniving, and not above using others to advance his own agenda.\n\n[[File:hugging.jpg|thumb|right|px|Mark congratulates Derek.]]\n\nMark first appeared in Seattle shortly after the bomb scare at the hospital with the sole intention of bringing Addison back to New York. During this visit, Meredith, Cristina, and Izzie discussed a nickname for Mark. They came up with such names as \"McSexy\" and \"McYummy\". Meredith was the one who came up with the name \"[[\"Mc\" Labeling|McSteamy]]\". From that moment on, the interns regularly used the nickname behind Sloan's back. He eventually found out about the nickname when Meredith, who was under the influence of painkillers, called to him ''\"McSteamy! Woo hoo!\"'' to which he replied, ''\"Is that what you're calling me now? McSteamy?\" ''She responded by saying, ''\"Yeah, but I don't think you're supposed to know that.\"''\n\nAddison rejected Mark's offer to bring her back to New York and Derek rejected his apology, leaving Mark to return empty-handed to New York.\n\nUpon his return, he was not warmly welcomed by Addison or Derek, although he desperately wanted to repair his relationships with both. He carried on a brief fling with [[Callie Torres]] before she reconciled with [[George O'Malley]], and developed a friendship with Meredith, although he hit on her before she and Derek resumed their relationship. Mark disliked Seattle, annoyed by the weather and the perceived inadequacies of the city in comparison to Manhattan, and was also discouraged by the continued strife among himself, Derek, and Addison.\n\nMark\us focus remains on repairing his relationships with Addison and Derek. In an effort to stray from the sexual nature of their past attempts, Mark entered a sixty-day abstinence pact with Addison with the agreement that if at the end of two months\u time they had remained celibate, Addison would agree to give a relationship with Mark another chance. However, thirty-two days into the pact, Mark witnessed Addison and Alex leaving an on-call room together, and realized what had happened between them. Hurt, he lied to Addison about breaking the pact. Mark and Derek remained estranged, but their relationship greatly mended, after Mark showed support and strength, while Meredith was fighting for her life.<ref>[[Some Kind of Miracle]], x</ref> After Addison left for Los Angeles, Mark and Derek have mended their relationship, and although the subject of Mark's infidelity is occasionally brought up, they have shown mutual respect for each other, and their respective surgical skills.\n\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Mark and Addison.]]\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nAddison, Mark and Derek were best friends. However, Addison felt that Derek was absent at home, and therefore slept with Mark, supposedly as a way of getting attention. After catching them in the act, Derek left New York for Seattle.\n\nAfter Derek declared his marriage to Addison and friendship with Mark over and left town, Mark and Addison lived together for two months. During this time, Addison became pregnant with Mark's baby. He was initially excited about the pregnancy, but Addison had an abortion after discovering that Mark had cheated on her and after a call from Richard Webber she left Mark to follow Derek to Seattle. Mark, however, remained sensitive to the date of Addison's abortion, but later admitted that he was not ready to become a father, and probably wouldn't have made a very good one at the time.\n\nLater, Mark followed them to Seattle to win them both back and tried to convince Addison that he loved her and her marriage was over because Derek was in love with Meredith. He went home without Addison, but after Addison found Meredith's panties in Derek's tuxedo, she called Mark for a \"transcontinental booty-call\". Derek came to apologize to Addison and found Mark coming out of the shower, at which point both Addison and Derek knew their marriage was over. After a quick trip back to New York to sublet his apartment and sell his practice, Mark took over the plastics program at Seattle Grace.\n\nMark tried to prove himself to Addison by abstaining from sex for sixty days. After discovering that Addison slept with Alex, Mark lied and said that he had slept with someone, thereby taking responsibility, and effectively ending their romance. They did, however, remain friends.\ua\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Mark and Lexie]]\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nMark decided to change his ways after the nurses started a campaign called ''Nurses against Mark Sloan'' and Miranda Bailey's defense was \"''He's a manwhore''\". He was single for a substantial amount of time, occasionally sleeping with Callie. Meredith started to worry that Mark was flirting with [[Lexie Grey]]. Derek told Mark to \"''keep little Sloan out of little Grey''\". However, Mark started to notice her and they began dating secretly with only Callie, Sadie, and Derek's mother aware of their relationship. When Addison came back to Seattle for a visit, she realized but Mark managed to keep her quiet. Their relationship continued, even after Lexie gave him a fractured penis.\n\nLexie soon grew tired of keeping secrets and told him she wasn't going to be his girlfriend until he told Derek. He confessed to Derek who eventually accepted it. Their relationship continued but things got awkward when Mark suggested they move in together, the subject moved to marriage and awkwardly they started to avoid each other. Mark decided to move on anyway and started looking for a house but Lexie told him he couldn't make her feel guilty.\n\nSometime after George O'Malley's death they moved in together. Later, however, Mark discovered he had a daughter, [[Sloan Riley]], who arrives seeking his support after becoming pregnant and being evicted by her mother. Mark permits her to move in with him, which angers Lexie. When Lexie makes it clear that she knew that Mark would choose his own daughter over her, she puts an end to their relationship. Sloan experiences difficulties in her pregnancy, so Mark takes her to LA to be treated. He and Addison once again sleep together, but when he comes back he tells Lexie because he doesn't want to lie to her and wants them to get back together, but when she tells him she slept with [[Alex Karev|Alex]], it puts an end to their relationship.\n\nDuring the hospital shooting, Mark helped Lexie save Alex, her new boyfriend. In the aftermath of the shooting, Lexie had a psychiatric episode and Mark had her committed to the psychiatric unit. Their friendship was strained. However, Lexie softened towards him when she learned that he was still in love with her. As Lexie went to talk to Mark about him still being in love with her, she saw Mark entering his apartment with Derek's sister [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], kissing her and ultimately having sex with her. When Callie's girlfriend, pediatric surgeon [[Arizona Robbins]], broke up with her, she and Mark had a drunken one-night-stand.\n\nShortly thereafter, he reconciled with Lexie, and the two got back together. Callie discovered she was pregnant with his child, and Mark was delighted, although he was conflicted because he knew Lexie did not want a child. When Mark revealed the news, she was ultimately dismayed and left Mark.\n\nAfter [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] and Lexie got into a relationship, initially Mark was jealous. He later gave them his blessing and told Lexie he would let her go. Lexie replied that she still loved him, but right now she needed Jackson to be happy. Mark only repeated that he would let her go.\n\nWhen Mark finally started dating again, Lexie was jealous. This even resulted in Lexie throwing a ball at Mark's [[Julia Canner|new girlfriend]] and mistakenly saying that she wished she could be in the OR with him when he was talking to his girlfriend on the phone.\n\nLater, Lexie finally told Mark that she was still in love with him. Mark told Derek that he was torn between Lexie, the woman he loved but who didn't want anything that he wanted, and [[Julia Canner|Julia]], who could give him everything he wanted. Mark and Lexie boarded the plane to Idaho with their feelings unresolved. After the plane crashed, Lexie was stuck under debris from the plane. Mark told Lexie that he loved her and that they were going to get married and have children, because they were meant to be. Lexie then died with a smile on her face. Mark broke down and held her hand for several hours after. He later suffered from a cardiac tamponade, which [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] (with [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]'s help) was able to resolve temporarily with some personal items that survived the crash. He fought for his life throughout the rest of their time in the woods, though he considered letting himself die, saying that he'll, \"''be okay. Lexie is waiting for [him].''\" Arizona reminded him that [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] was waiting for him to return home and that he had to survive for her sake.\n\nAfter they were rescued, Julia came to the hospital. She told him that she loved him, but he replied that he loved Lexie, therefore ending their relationship. Mark spent two months fighting to recover before falling into a coma.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nCallie and Derek watched over him. Before falling into a coma, Mark had signed paperwork stating that he wanted to be removed from life support if there were no signs of improvement after  days. When that time came, they took him off life support and he died.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nAfter Mark and Lexie's relationship fell apart, he began a sexual relationship with cardiothoracic surgeon [[Teddy Altman]], despite the fact she was in love with their SGH's [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]], [[Owen Hunt]]. They had a few weeks of dating, which seemed to be going well. Mark later slept with [[Reed Adamson]], as he and Teddy were not exclusively dating. There was no official breakup but they both stopped seeing each other.\n\n[[Julia Canner]]\nAfter Lexie and Mark's breakup and [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia's]]\uabirth, Mark hit a dry spell for a little while. He was so focused on being a new father that he didn't actively pursue romance. After he picked up an obsession with cooking,\ua[[Callie Torres|Callie]]\uasuggested that he find a new girlfriend. Julia works at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] and was part of the softball game between the two hospitals. She and Mark dated for several months, however it was quite obvious Mark was still not over Lexie, especially when she and Jackson broke up. In spite of this, Mark and Julia were quite serious.\uaThey even discussed having a child together. However, before that could happen, Lexie professed her love for Mark. Shortly after, Mark and Lexie\ua[[Flight|were in a plane crash]], in which Lexie died from her injuries, leaving Mark devastated. When Julia visited him in the hospital after the crash, he broke up with her, saying that he loved\ua[[Lexie Grey|Lexie]].\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nWhen Amelia came to Seattle to make good with her brother after he was shot, she slept with Mark Sloan the day before she left.\n\n\nMark attended medical school at [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], completed his residency in [[otolaryngology]], a fellowship in plastic surgery, and quickly became one of the most highly-regarded [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgeons]] on the East Coast with a thriving private practice.\n\nDuring a surgery with Mark Sloan, [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Erica Hahn]] commented on a technique that he was performing. Instead of using wires, he was using cables to repair his patient. He said that he learned this \"Tension banding\" technique back in New York after Columbia, when he studied under [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Crash Into Me, Part |John Seever]].<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref> \n\nProfessionally, Mark was regarded as a very successful and renowned surgeon and one of New York's finest plastic surgeons. [[Alex Karev]] referred to him as the \"go-to-guy\" for plastics on the East Coast, and Richard Webber proposed that the addition of Mark to Seattle Grace's plastics program would double the revenue of other departments. He is skilled at delicate and complex reconstructive procedures, but also performs cosmetic procedures. Of his personal philosophy, he says: \"People don't come to me to fix what's on the outside. They come to me to fix what's on the inside.\"\n\nBefore moving to Seattle, he owned a private practice with Addison Montgomery and Derek Shepherd. However, when they moved away he decided to win them back and sold the practice.\n\nAfter some time working at SGH, he considered terminating his verbal contract with Richard and moving back to sunny New York but he decided to stay after Meredith let it slip that Richard was retiring. Mark entered the race for the chief position and quickly gained the advantage when the others prepared ten year plans and he prepared a right-now plan (taking the words from Bailey). The board members and the chief applauded him, but in the end he failed to become chief. However, he stayed at Seattle Grace to work on his relationship with Derek and Seattle itself started to appeal to him too.\n\nMark began to take an interest in mentoring [[Jackson Avery]]. Derek surmised that his \"sudden interest in education\" was a result of him not being in a sexual relationship at that time. Jackson had initially been interested in neurosurgery, but later switched to plastics, much to his [[Catherine Fox|mother's]] chagrin. After Mark's death, Jackson took over their work.\n\n\n*To French viewers, Mark is known as Dr. Glamour, not McSteamy. To German viewers, he is known as McTraumprinz (Traumprinz roughly means \"Dream Prince\") or McSexy, and to Swedish viewers, he is known as Dr. Hot. In the Italian version, he is called Dr. Bollore (which means hot). In the Czech version, viewers know him as Mc\udhav\ufd (which also means hot). In Brazil, he's known as Gostos\ueo (which means super hot). In Finland, he's known as Kuumatohtori (which means hot doctor).\n*He didn't think arena football was real football.\n*His choice of coffee was a bone dry cappuccino.\n*He was not opposed to physician-assisted suicide.<ref>[[Suicide is Painless]], x</ref>\n*He shared his first and last name with the character Dick van Dyke played on \"Diagnosis: Murder\".\n*He had Chicken Pox when he was six.\n*Mark was \"[[Board Certification|double-board certified]]\" in [[Board Certification#American Board of Otolaryngology|ENT]] and [[Board Certification#American Board of Plastic Surgery|plastics]].\n**In the real world, this would mean that Mark had completed a five year residency in [[Otolaryngology]] and then a six year residency in [[Plastic Surgery]] because facial reconstructive surgery exists as a fellowship of [[Otolaryngology]], and not the other way around.\n*Mark was the interim [[Chief of Surgery|chief of surgery]] during [[Support System]].\n*He put [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] frog in the microwave when he was ten, but never turned it on.\n*He started to learn Spanish so that [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] could grow up knowing her heritage and culture.\n*He was on his high school football team.\n*He thought surprise parties were too hostile.\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nMarkSloan.png\nMarkSloan.png\nxMarkSloan.png\nxMarkSloan.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Mark-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Yesterday]]\n*[[In the Midnight Hour]]\n*[[Flight]]\n*[[Going, Going, Gone]]\n*[[Remember the Time]]\n\n\n:'''Mark:''' I love you.

They were trapped together during the shooting in the hospital.\n\n\n\nMary and her husband Bill came to the hospital so Bailey could perform a colostomy bag reversal surgery. She was told she couldn't have her second surgery because she needed a blood transfusion first. She hadn't eaten anything for quite some time, so she asked her husband to get her a pizza. While Bill was away, the hospital was put under lockdown because of [[Gary Clark]], who was shooting people in the hospital. Mary noticed something was wrong because her husband hadn't returned yet (he wasn't allowed to enter the hospital anymore) and Dr. Bailey kept hanging around in her room (because of the lockdown).\n\nHowever, Dr. Bailey refused to confess that there was something wrong until Charles Percy entered the room, saying the shooter was on the floor. Mary was really scared when Bailey looked through the window and saw Gary coming their way. She told Mary to play dead and covered her with the bed sheet. Charles hid himself in the bathroom and Bailey hid herself under Mary's bed.\n\nGary Clark entered the room and started crying because he thought the hospital had killed another patient, like his wife. He was about to leave the room when he heard a noise in the bathroom. He discovered Charles, who confessed he was a surgeon. Gary then shot him in the abdomen and also pulled Bailey from under the bed. However, she said she was a nurse and Gary left the room after reloading his gun.\n\nMary then finally could breathe again. Bailey then urged her to assist her while trying to keep Charles alive. Mary handed over supplies to Bailey. Bailey couldn't do much however, and they tried to drag Charles to an OR. Mary feared Gary might come back, but Bailey managed to calm her down. Bailey then talked Mary through helping her start to treat Charles.\ua''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nThey dragged the bleeding Charles to the elevators on one of Mary's sheets, but the elevators were turned off because of the lockdown. Realizing there was nothing they could do, they sat down to comfort a dying Charles. After an emotional conversation with Dr. Bailey, Charles passed away. After Gary had killed himself, the lockdown was lifted. Mary and Bill were reunited and hugged. Mary cried when Bill asked her if she was okay.\ua''(\"[[Death and All His Friends]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the shooting, Mary and Bill decided to travel. They went to Paris, Morocco, Alaska, and went on a cruise through the Baltic. ''(\"[[These Arms of Mine]]\")''\n\n\nSix months after the shooting, Mary and her husband were featured in a documentary about the shooting. Mary was followed by a TV crew on the day she was admitted to the hospital for a second time. Bailey and Mary were relieved to see each other again.\n\nBailey performed the colostomy bag reversal surgery flawlessly. However, it later turned out that Mary wouldn't wake up. Bailey sadly explained to Bill that it's very rare, but that it sometimes happen that patients don't wake up from the anesthesia after surgery. When her organs started failing, Bill decided to take her off of life support.\ua''(\"[[These Arms of Mine]]\")''\n\n\nFollowing her death, [[Jennifer Stanley|a pathologist]] performed an autopsy on Mary's body together with Bailey. Bailey constantly argued with the pathologist because she got really attached to Mary and she thought that the pathologist wasn't doing her job right. Sadly, the cause of her coma was never found and Bailey had to tell Bill that she had no idea why Mary didn't wake up after surgery.\ua''(\"[[That's Me Trying]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Mary and Bill]]\n\nBill Portman\nMary married Bill and they were living a happy life together. Mary revealed in the documentary that they were thinking about having kids after the surgery. They never got to do that, as Mary was in a coma after surgery. Her devastated husband decided to take her off of life support after a couple of days when her organs started to fail.\n\n\n*When asked what she was looking forward to most after her surgery, she responded \"Babies, lots and lots of babies.\"\n*She was  at the time of her death.\n*Her bloodtype is most likely A, with an unknown Rh factor, as Charles can be seen holding a unit of type A blood when he's in her room.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref>\n*Dr. Bailey got very attached to Mary, which is very rare.

''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part.

''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural to practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nLeo, Sadie, and Megan all had to work with Izzie in the clinic for a day. When they did procedures on patients, she also had them perform them on her. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries.

They lived into adulthood without being separated, but as adults, they looked into separation. They decided against it initially because Pete was scared of the risks, but then six months later, they reconsidered because Jake had fallen in love with [[Elena]] and wanted to be able to be with her without his brother coming along. They'd had a fight over Pete taking Elena's side in an argument and Pete accidentally touching Elena while she and Jake were having sex.\n\nThe doctors set up dummies that represented Jake and Pete and practice the surgery. [[Derek Shepherd]] thought the surgery was too risky, but he was convinced to go ahead. Despite a problem during surgery, each of them had two functioning legs and were successfully separated.\n\nAfterward, in recovery, Elena came to see Pete, but he was disinterested in her. He was put in a room with his brother and they started to make-up with each other, holding hands when their beds were pushed together.\n\n\n\nHe had feelings for his brother's girlfriend, [[Elena]]. She reciprocated the feelings, but also loved Jake.\n\n\nHe was born conjoined to his brother, Jake. They had rules that governed their lives and helped keep the peace between them.

When they saw George cleaning out his locker, they went to check out the cafeteria. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nOn his first day as an intern, he was assigned to [[Alex Karev]], who took them on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thatcher Grey]] came in drunk and kept asking for Dr. Grey, Pierce came to get Alex because he didn't know what do to. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. Karev said that he wanted to dump Pierce because he hated saying the name.\ua''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural as practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Mark broke his penis, the interns watched his surgery and gossiped about how it had happened. Sadie confessed to it being her, despite it actually being Lexie. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Warren Kramer]] came into the ER with an object lodged in his rectum, Steve, Pierce, and Ryan all laughed over his predicament. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. [[Lexie Grey]] ended up winning the contest.\ua''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns worked on Patient X (actually Izzie using her own scans and labs) and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended Alex and Izzie's wedding. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen George died, Pierce attended the funeral. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program.\n\nCristina had Pierce, Megan, and Leo spy on the Chief for her and report back what they saw. Pierce was ultimately cut as part of the first round of layoffs. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nPierce participated in a documentary someone was making about the doctors from the hospital. He was interviewed even though he was only working in the morgue. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] once considered using him to \"scratch an itch\", asking [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] if he was clean, but later decided against it.\n\n[[Megan Nowland]]\nPierce was dating [[Megan Nowland|Megan]] at some point, but they broke up, when she found a nurse's number on him, and then got back together. During their break, Megan slept with [[Steve Mostow|Steve]], and Steve accidentally sent an email to people about their hookup, including Pierce. According to [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]], Pierce wants to kill Steve, but it appears that Steve has punched Pierce, with Pierce having a black eye and Steve having a bloody hand. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nPierce and [[Alex Karev|Alex]] have a mutual dislike for each other. When Alex was trying to decide which intern to give to George, he considered Pierce because he didn't like the name.\n\nLater, after operating on [[Sadie Harris|Sadie]], Alex told the interns he didn't respect them but Pierce noted that he still respected Izzie, even though she killed [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|a patient]].\n\n\nOriginally one of [[Alex Karev|Alex Karev's]] [[Internship|interns]], he was later reassigned to George O'Malley. He was part of the secret intern society.\n\nDuring his second year of [[Resident|residency]], Pierce was part of the first round of lay-offs when [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] merged.\n\nPierce is now working in the morgue at Seattle Grace. But he doesn't appear to be too happy about his new job, referring to it as \" working in the underbelly of Seattle Grace\" and that he hates it.

Arizona was laughing due to shock, but stopped abruptly when Jerry told her that he couldn't feel his legs.\n\nWhen Cristina came back to splint Arizona's leg, she sent Cristina to stabilize Jerry's C-spine. Jerry managed to release his seatbelt while he told Cristina and Arizona that it should be not more than four hours before they were found. Cristina used a board and some tape from the plane to stabilize his head and neck. He instructed her on where to find things and then asked her if he was paralyzed or if he'd walk again. She took a pen and jabbed it into his leg. When he had no reaction, she apologized.\n\nWhile they were out in the woods, Jerry heard a helicopter. He told the doctors to fire the flare gun, but it didn't fire properly and the helicopter left.

However, Izzie blew off the appointment. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\nAfter Izzie accepted treatment and was admitted, Swender took over her care. She made it clear that all the other doctors working on her case answered to her. When Derek went to remove Izzie's brain mets, Swender observed and questioned his ability to remove the mets without killing her. Despite her questioning, the surgery was successful. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\nIzzie started chemo and was planning Meredith and Derek's wedding. Swender wanted her to save her energy because the IL was highly toxic and she'd eventually hit a wall, which she did later that day. ''(\"[[Sweet Surrender]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek wanted to remove Izzie's hippocampus to remove a brain met that couldn't be removed another way, Swender protested that, saying it could damage her memory and she should just continue with the IL instead. Derek agreed to do a test that might determine what her memory would look like after the surgery. Izzie didn't pass the memory test, but he wanted to do the surgery anyway. Izzie decided not to have the surgery under pressure from Meredith. However, she changed her mind after Alison Clark died, though she signed a DNR before surgery. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\nWhen Izzie's cancer stopped growing, Swender wasn't interested anymore and passed Izzie's case off to [[E. Gendall]]. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nWhen another patient of hers named [[Alison Clark]] (also with stage IV cancer)\uadeveloped complications, Cristina scrubbed in with Dr. Swender to try to save her. Despite that, Alison suffered brain damage and was unable to come off the ventillator. Despite being a surgeon herself, Dr. Swender justified to Cristina why chemotherapy and other non-surgical treatments are often\uamore effective than surgery in treating cancer. For example, she stated that when Alison Clark was referred to her, she had only three months to live. However, chemotherapy kept her alive for two years. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Alison Clark came into the hospital with her husband, Gary, after collapsing at the grocery store, Swender did a biopsy that showed that her cancer was back.

For the lab, Owen stabbed four live pigs and told the doctors to save their lives. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural to practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting outside an on-call room trying to get some sleep, Dani, Steve, and Ryan heard a loud, painful moan when Mark broke his penis. Later, while they watched his surgery, they gossiped about who might have broken it. Sadie eventually confessed, despite it actually being Lexie. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Warren Kramer]] came into the ER with an object lodged in his rectum, Steve, Pierce, and Ryan all laughed over his predicament. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. Ryan, Lexie, and Steve reached the finish line at the same time, but Lexie gave the correct diagnosis, making her the winner. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nRyan survived the first round of cutbacks, but was worried when the Mercy West residents started at the newly-merged hospital.

''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\n\nOn her first day, Sadie joined the interns practicing procedures on each other. She encouraged them to use fewer pain meds in order to avoid detection. She cut her own shoulder and offered to let them stitch it up. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering the interns. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\n\nSadie agreed to let one of the other interns cut out her appendix on the condition she could do the same for one of them. Lexie agreed and started to operate with an epidural. When they got to the appendix, they saw that it was inflamed, meaning it wasn't routine. Sadie also had severe hemorrhaging. They called Meredith and Cristina in, who finished the surgery with the help of Bailey, needing to remove a portion of her cecum to stop the bleeding. After the surgery, Sadie was put on probation with all the other interns. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nSadie examined [[Holly Anderson]] in the ER and failed to notice signs of a basilar skull fracture, which ultimately led to her death. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhile working on the case of [[Jackson Prescott]], Sadie noticed a black spot on his duodenum, meaning the organs weren't suitable for transplant. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[William Dunn]] started coding, Sadie tried to get Meredith to help him, but Meredith ordered Sadie to leave and find something else to do. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Mark broke his penis, the interns watched his surgery and gossiped about who had done it. Sadie saw how uncomfortable Lexie was, so she confessed despite knowing it was Lexie. She also guarded the door so Lexie could be with Mark after his surgery. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nLeo, Sadie, and Megan all had to work with Izzie in the clinic for a day. When they did procedures on patients, she also had them perform them on her. Sadie ended up mislabeling a patient's blood sample with the sample taken from Izzie.''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. Sadie incorrectly draped her patient and had to start over. She later cheated by listening in when Lexie \"diagnosed\" Mark. She also pointed the ultrasound wand at [[Jen Harmon|Jen Harmon's]] baby's butt instead of his heart. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nHer mistakes drew suspicion from George, who worried about her knowledge lagging behind where it should be. He offered to help her catch up, but she said she didn't need a tutor. George told her she could go to the Chief herself or he could. Rather than be known as a cheater, Sadie quit and left the hospital. Before leaving, she tried to convince Meredith to come with her and start travelling again to be free, but Meredith declined. It's possible that Sadie decided to travel on her own.\ua''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]] suspected that Sadie was flirting with her but she was never sure. Callie found her to be attractive. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhen traveling around Europe with [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], they had a fight in Amsterdam. They made up, but never were as close as before. When Cristina and Meredith were fighting, Sadie advised Meredith to apologize to prevent it from happening again with someone else. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\nHer arrival in [[Seattle]] caused some friction between herself and [[Cristina Yang]], as Yang is jealous of their close relationship. She formed a friendship with [[Lexie Grey]], after deciding that she \"maybe isn't such a priss\" and looking for allies. She proved her friendship to Lexie when she pretended to be the one to \"''break''\" [[Mark Sloan|Mark's]] penis, when the interns laughed at Lexie.\n\n\n[[File:Sadiecutsherself.jpg|thumb|left|px|Interns perform a surgery on Sadie.]]\nShe delayed her residency by working in a morgue before starting her internship at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]]. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nKnowing that she is not \"book smart,\" she came to Seattle Grace hoping Meredith could help her get through her internship.\n\nSadie began a friendship with fellow intern Lexie Grey, despite Meredith's warning that Lexie was naive, sheltered, and the kind of girl who grew up with \"parents and rules and smiley face posters on her wall.\" Joining the group of Seattle Grace surgical interns starving for a chance to practice their skills, Sadie volunteered herself for an appendectomy, so the other interns could practice and learn how to perform the procedure, provided she was given a chance afterwards at performing another procedure herself. Sadie's life was seriously endangered when the surgery went wrong, though fortunately Meredith and Cristina managed to save her. She was put on probation, along with the other interns, and rebuked by Meredith for her poor judgment, though later she told Lexie that she is not sorry. To try to let Lexie off her punishment, Sadie told the chief that the appendectomy was her idea and her own fault, but the chief said that the decision was up to him, telling her that the only reason she was still at the hospital was because of her father.\n\nSadie participated in [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie's]] game/competition for the interns, though her limited knowledge caused her to make serious mistakes in many of the tasks, such as draping a patient completely wrong for a [[Medical Glossary#W|whipple]] and using the doppler at \"the fetus's ass\" to find a heartbeat on an ultrasound. [[George O'Malley|George]] noticed that Sadie was falling behind and asked her to talk to the chief, finally giving her an ultimatum - talk to the chief, or he will. As a result, Sadie quit, with George hinting to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] that she may have cheated her way into the surgical program.

Steve had his first parentless Halloween in . He trick-or-treated with his sister. It was dusk and drizzling and they decided to go to Mr. C's house. Mr. C lived down the street from them and was famous for two things--dentures and the Halloween house. Each year he transformed his colonial style home into a haunted-palooza, and himself into Monster C. Steve had a longstanding theory that Monster C was simply Mr. C sans the dentures. And as a young scientist/future doctor he was excited to check out the inside of his mouth and the state of his toothless gums. However, he opened the door as a full-toothed bizarro version of Bozo the Clown popped out from the spider web, frizzy red hair and all. And it was then that they realized that the \"C\" in Monster C stood for clown. Cindy was afraid of clowns and ran screaming from the house. He claimed not to be afraid, but he ran with Cindy. Unfortunately, a boy named Mitch Donovan, who was egging Mr. C's car, saw them and continued to call Steve, ''Scarecrow Steve'' all the way through high school.\n\n\nOn his first day, he was assigned to [[Cristina Yang]]. Cristina took the group on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules. However, her speech was derailed when her pager didn't go off as she told the interns to move when she moves.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nSteve worked in the clinic for a day. He asked if they'd get to do any procedures on their own, but Bailey said they would not. ''(\"[[Love/Addiction]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nMegan told Steve that Henry, presumably another intern, was observing in [[Tricia Hale|Tricia Hale's]] surgery when Mark Sloan announced to the whole OR that [[Izzie Stevens]] and [[George O'Malley]] had broken up. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the navigational computer broke while [[Mary Daltrey]] was having surgery, Derek sent Steve to go to the desk and ask anyone if they knew anything about computers. Nobody came, so Steve went back. Steve later held the probe steady while Derek helped Rose fix the computer. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina was stabbed by an icicle, Steve and [[Dani Mandvi|Dani]] treated her, though she berated them because they didn't know how to read the x-ray. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nSteve was given an epidural so they could practice that. They forgot to put in a catheter when they did it, so he peed himself. They suggested they could take out his appendix as practice, but he refused. He was then confined to a bed until it wore off. Steve was later put on probation with all the other interns. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting outside an on-call room trying to get some sleep, Dani, Steve, and Ryan heard a loud, painful moan when Mark broke his penis. Later, while they watched his surgery, they gossiped about who might have broken it. Sadie eventually confessed, despite it actually being Lexie. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Warren Kramer]] came into the ER with an object lodged in his rectum, Steve, Pierce, and Ryan all laughed over his predicament. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. Steve, Ryan, and Lexie reached the finish line at the same time, but Lexie gave the correct diagnosis, so she was declared the winner. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended Alex and Izzie's wedding. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen George died, Steve attended the funeral. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program. He survived the first round of layoffs. He told Lexie Grey that while he was safe, [[Megan Nowland]] was cut. Megan was pregnant with his child.\ua''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thatcher Grey]] came in in need of a liver, Steve drew some of Lexie's blood to see if she was a match. ''(\"[[Tainted Obligation]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Derek was looking for someone who was a natural at microsurgery, Steve gave it a shot, but failed. ''(\"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\")''\n\n\nSteve participated in the documentary someone was making about doctors from the hospital. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nSteve attended a party thrown by Derek at [[Meredith's House]]. ''(\"[[Shiny Happy People]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the hospital shooting, Steve was among the doctors locked down in peds. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] got funding to do a special trauma certification for the residents, Steve assisted him, helping him set up and handing out cards with symptoms. ''(\"[[That's Me Trying]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Megan Nowland]]\nDuring [[Pierce Halley|Pierce]] and [[Megan Nowland|Megan's]] break, Megan slept with Steve and Steve accidentally sent an email to people about their hookup, including Pierce. According to [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]], Pierce wants to kill Steve, and Steve loves Megan, but it appears that Steve has punched Pierce, with Pierce having a black eye and Steve having a bloody hand. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\nSteve was married to Megan, by his uncle, at the back of the hospital, with [[Graciella Guzman]] as a witness. But however, he found out that Megan actually did a paternity test, without his knowledge. While Megan opened the envelope containing the results, he got into a fight with Pierce. Despite finding out that Megan's baby was actually his, he divorced her. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\nGirlfriend\nLater, Steve mentioned a new girlfriend while operating. ''(\"[[All You Need is Love]]\")''\n\n\nSteve got on with all interns and used to get on with [[Pierce Halley|Pierce]] before his break-up with [[Megan Nowland|Megan]]. When [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] was stabbed with an icicle he (and the other interns) took pictures on his phone. He is one of the many who loves [[Joe]] and [[Emerald City Bar]].\n\nAt Halloween, Dr. Yang informed the interns that they were to dress up for Halloween, so Steve bought a clown costume. He expected Cristina to be impressed but when she wasn't, he came to the conclusion that she had a fear of clowns.\n\n\nSteve was one of [[Cristina Yang|Cristina Yang's]] [[Internship|interns]]. When Cristina was stabbed, he could not read the [[Medical Glossary#X|X-ray]] as he said she always read them.\n\nSteve was part of the intern group that [[In the Midnight Hour|operated on themselves]], however, Steve specifically was not present during the surgery, as he had been given an epidural a few hours prior and was unable to walk, and had also wet himself. He is an aspiring neurosurgeon. His favorite surgery that he scrubbed in on was a craniotomy with [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]] when he held a probe inside someone\us brain.\n\nSteve is one of the better interns, in Izzie's ''intern bowl'', he tied for second with [[Ryan Spalding]] and just lost to [[Lexie Grey]].\n\nSteve became a second year [[Resident|resident]] and survived the first round of layoffs when [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] merged with [[Mercy West Medical Center]].\n\n\n*Steve had an [http://blogs.abc.com/internsteve/about.html official blog], which has since been removed.\n*He doesn't like dead people.<ref>[[Invasion]], x</ref>\n*His favorite color is light blue.\n*He dressed as a clown for Halloween.<ref>[[Haunt You Every Day]], x</ref>\n*His talents include board games, suturing fruit, Guitar and Mini-Golf\n*His nd favorite Seattle location is Pike Place Market (a.k.a.

In response, she started interning at a local medical non-profit. She also traveled to Europe, South America, and Africa, where she saw a kid in Zimbabwe wake up after a month in a coma. After a year, she reapplied to medical school and got in. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nIn her first year, Sydney was responsible for the death of a young patient. He came in with a fever, nausea, and stomach pain. She diagnosed gastroenteritis and sent him home. He came back a few days later with a ruptured appendix and died in surgery. She had a breakdown, so she was given time off, and when she returned, she put a smile on her face and made everyone believe that she was all right. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")'' ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\nAs an intern, she was labelled \"[[]]\", much like George. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] was on maternity leave, Sydney took over overseeing her residents. She clashed with [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], who found Sydney's positive attitude unbearable. Cristina, at one point, even thought she was purposefully killing a patient because Sydney took a risky approach to treat necrotizing fasciitis in [[Claire Solomon|an active young woman]]. However, her approach worked and she believed Claire would be okay after a few sessions in a hyperbaric chamber. Cristina later apologized to Sydney for overstepping. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nShe attended the [[Hospital Prom]], where she got sick off spike punch. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny]] died, Sydney was assigned as [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie's]] peer counselor. Izzie was initially reticent, unwilling to open up to Sydney, but once Sydney confessed her own failings, Izzie was able to slightly open up. Sydney was compassionate when Izzie said that it \"scared [her] too much\" to discuss what had happened. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\n\nSydney helped out when the interns were being taught triage skills, pretending to be a patient that Izzie was treating. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the ferry crash, Sydney tended to patients in the clinic. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\nSeeing that Alex was stressed, she offered him the chance to sit for a minute or get a hug. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nShe spoke to the family members, saying she knew it was frustrating, but asking them to donate blood if they could. She later told Bailey that she heard what Bailey did for Meredith and said she was great competition for Chief Resident. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nBecause Bailey was busy with [[Lawrence Jennings]], Sydney was called to oversee the clinic for a day. She wanted to improve patient satisfaction, so she ordered Izzie to do nasal lavage on a patient she thought had a cold. ''(\"[[Desire]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith brought Ellis's ashes to work on Halloween, Sydney told her that in tribal culture, a person trying to cleanse the past cuts off his or her own hair and buries it. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n\nSydney went on a date with Derek at [[Emerald City Bar]]. She got paged during their date and Mark came up and pointed out how poorly the date was going. She later told Derek that she didn't think there was a future for them because she thought she was too much woman for him. They agreed not to let it affect their work. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nAfter introducing herself to [[Derek Shepherd]], they went out on a date. After the date, however, Sydney informed Derek that he wasn't ready for the kind of relationship she needed (much to Derek's relief, as he was going to let her down gently anyway), but they agreed not to let their relationship affect their work life. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nShe has a friend named Karen who works at a restaurant in downtown Seattle. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nShe served as [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie's]] peer counselor and revealed that her perky persona actually originated from a nervous breakdown she suffered after losing a patient of her own.\n\n\nDr. Sydney Heron is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She was in the same class year as [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] and was in the race to be [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]]. In order to better her position, she mastered several complex surgical procedures. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\nUnfortunately, she lost out to [[Callie Torres|Callie]], who was then replaced by Bailey.\n\nDespite her excesses, Sydney has proven herself to be a competent surgeon. For example, she successfully saved the leg of a patient with Necrotizing Fasciitis, assertively defending her decision when challenged by Preston Burke.

Cristina eventually came in to examine him and he begged her to help him, saying he didn't want to die. She paged Derek and William was rushed to surgery.\n\nHis surgery was interrupted by [[Miranda Bailey]] who, after hearing that Dunn's organs were a match for Jackson, asked Derek to put down the scalpel and let Dunn die. Shepherd allowed her to choose if he lived or died. Realizing the nature of what she was asking, she couldn't let him die, and told Derek to continue and swiftly left.\n[[File:Dunn'sexecution.jpg|thumb|left|px|Dunn's execution.]]\nAfter the surgery, William told Meredith he had been playing her the whole time. She said he was scared because death is scary. He then asked if she could attend his execution so he could at least see one friendly face in the crowd.\n\n\nMeredith attended William's execution at [[Caldwell Correctional Facility]].
