Like I'm damaged goods. I'm still me. I'm still here.|'''Adele Webber''' to '''[[Richard Webber]]'''}}\n\n'''Adele Webber''' was the wife of\ua[[Richard Webber]]. She had Alzheimer's and died of a heart attack after surgery.\ua\n\n\n\nAfter the surgery to remove Richard's brain tumor, Derek called Adele to inform her about it, as Richard hadn't told her himself. Derek did it because having someone at home with him was the only way he was allowing Richard to leave the hospital, and so Adele ditched her trip to the Virgin Island to take care of her husband. When she came to the hospital to visit him, Addison stopped by too. Adele told them that she knew they'd get back together, but Derek denied this, saying he and Addison were over. ''(\"[[Enough is Enough]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard was dealing with the bomb scare at the hospital, he had what looked like a heart attack, so his wife was called. She refused to let him get out of bed and go back to work. ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n\nAdele was chaperoning [[Camille Travis|Camille's]] prom when Camille passed out while having sex. Adele came into the ER with her, where Addison broke the news to her that Camille's ovarian cancer had returned. When Richard sent her friends away, Adele yelled at him, saying he needed to make it up to Camille and put their family ahead of the hospital. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\n\nAdele made an appointment to see her husband, knowing that's the only way she'd get some time with him. She was very upset when he left during their meeting time to deal with a hospital issue. When he returned later, she said it was time for him to retire, to choose her over the hospital. She was upset when he wanted time to think about it, saying she didn't have any more time to give. ''(\"[[Time Has Come Today]]\")''\n\nRichard later decided he was going to step down. He told the board and came to Adele's with flowers. However, she said she'd told him months ago she didn't have any more time to give, and Richard realized she had begun\uaseeing someone else. She told him she was sorry, but wondered what he expected. ''(\"[[Great Expectations]]\")''\n\n\nAdele came into the ER after being in a minor car accident. While she was being examined, she confessed to Addison that she was pregnant. She had some spotting, so Addison wanted to keep her overnight for observation, but Adele later passed out in a bathroom with vaginal bleeding. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nShe was taken to the ER, where Addison examined her. Addison told Richard that Adele might be having a miscarriage. When Adele woke up, Addison did an ultrasound and was able to find a fetal heartbeat, though it was slow. She gave her a transfusion and fluids in the hopes it would help. However, Adele was later rushed to the OR. Addison did what she could, but she was unable to save the pregnancy. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\nAfter her miscarriage, she still wouldn't allow Richard to move back in and wasn't returning his calls. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nAdele came into the ER with Camille, who was unable to breathe. When they found out that her cancer had spread, Camille said she wanted to die, but Adele and Arlene begged Richard to convince her to have more treatment. He planned to, but backed off when he saw how tired and worn down Camille was. Adele was upset, saying she'd already lost one baby and now was losing another. Richard told her that she couldn't use Camille to make up for the fact that they never had children. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nWhen several of the nurses complained about [[Mark Sloan]], Adele was brought on as a nurse mediator and worked with [[Wayne Sheehan]] to develop a [[Date and Tell]] policy to protect the hospital from potential litigation. She'd taken the job so that she could feel important. ''(\"[[The Becoming]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Bailey decided to go into pediatric surgery, Richard became upset with her. As a result, Bailey called in Adele, who yelled at both of them. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nAdele came into the hospital worried because Richard hadn't come home the night before and hadn't called. She thought something might have happened to him. When she saw the way Bailey interacted with Richard, she asked if they were having an affair. Bailey vehemently denied it, but Adele was still convinced he was having an affair with someone. ''(\"[[New History]]\")''\n\n\nAdele came into the hospital with a broken wrist and was confused about the events that led up to her fall. Meredith ran a CT, suspecting a head injury. The CT was clean, so Meredith suggested that Adele might have Alzheimer's. Richard flatly rejected the idea and took Adele home. ''(\"[[Golden Hour]]\")''\n\nShortly after that, Adele came into the hospital after a second accident. She claimed she fell due to the shoes she was wearing, but Richard was concerned and asked Bailey to run tests to try to figure out the cause of her falls. Her tests showed nothing physically wrong with her, so Bailey told Richard he should get Derek to check Adele out. He then asked Derek to examine her. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\nDerek ran some tests and diagnosed Adele with Alzheimer's. Richard begged Derek to include Adele in his Alzheimer's trial, though Derek said the trial and the waiting list were both full, plus they didn't even know if she fit the criteria for the trial. When [[Sonya Amin]] dropped out of the trial, Derek agreed to screen Adele for his trial. She scored one point too high to qualify, but still had Alzheimer's. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\nAfter seeing a post-it that had fallen off Richard's sweater that labelled him as Adele's husband, Meredith figured out that Adele's condition had quickly gotten worse. After a clinical trial patient died, they re-tested her and found that she met the criteria for the trial. After Meredith spoke with Adele and Adele mistook her for Ellis, Meredith realized how much worse she'd gotten. She joined the trial and had her surgery. After Richard told her that all he wanted was to be with Adele, Meredith went into the pharmacy where the packets were being kept and after finding out that Adele was designated to get the placebo, she switched the packet with another one so she'd get the active agent. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\nOn the day Richard performed his ,th surgery, Adele tried to walk to the hospital to find Richard. Their neighbor, [[Mrs. Vanderburg]], found her and drove her the rest of the way. Once at the hospital, she demanded to see Richard. April took her to the gallery so she could see him operate, where she saw Meredith operating with him and believed it was Ellis. When she started to yell, Meredith suggested that Richard use a happy memory to try grounding her, something that worked with Ellis. He started singing their wedding song, My Funny Valentine, to her and she sang along. He then took her home and put her to bed. ''(\"[[Hope for the Hopeless]]\")''\n\nOne morning, Richard woke up to find that Adele had started a fire in her confusion. He was burned trying to put the fire out. This incident made him realize Adele might need more care than he could give and they toured [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]] together. She said that he had promised to buy her a house, confused about what they were doing there and he decided to take her home. When she later saw that she had gotten confused and thrown things at a nurse and then at Richard, she asked him if she had Alzheimer's. She then said that Roseridge seemed like a nice place and they agreed that she'd go there. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\nAt the home, her condition continued to deteriorate and she developed a romantic relationship with [[Allan (Grey's Anatomy)|Allan]], another resident with dementia. When Richard found them in bed together, he asked that she be moved to another room. In the new room, she was upset and asked about Allan, unable to remember Richard, even after he sang My Funny Valentine to her. After realizing that his presence was doing more harm than good, Richard left and allowed Allan to take his seat. ''(\"[[The Girl with No Name]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Richard and Bailey were being driven to Bailey's wedding in a limo, Richard got a phone call from the hospital. They informed him that Adele was coming to the ER. Bailey then ordered the limo driver to take them to the hospital immediately. Right after her arrival, she started to take care of Adele. Richard wanted to do it at first, but he wasn't allowed because he was a family member. ''(\"[[Run, Baby, Run]]\")''\n\nBailey postponed her wedding, which led to Meredith coming back to the hospital to take over from Bailey. However, Bailey didn't want to leave Adele and they operated on her together. During surgery, they ran out of options, but Richard came with an idea that they used to successfully fix the aneurysm.\n\nAfter surgery, Adele woke up. Richard stayed with her and Meredith and Bailey returned to the wedding. However, when Richard eventually showed up at the wedding as well, Meredith knew something was wrong with Adele. Richard told her she died of a heart attack because the surgery was too much for her heart. ''(\"[[Things We Said Today]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nAdele married Richard Webber when she was . She always knew about his affair with [[Ellis Grey]] but didn't leave him as she loved him and knew he would eventually end it, but she had finally had enough when Richard put his other hospital patients above her dying niece.\n\nWhen Richard failed to return home on the night of the prom, she made an appointment to see him at the office, but was blown off because of another hospital emergency. It proved one too many, however, and she gave him an ultimatum: her or the hospital. Richard tried to avoid making the choice, but Adele was tired of his indecision, and left him.\n\nWhen Dr. Richard Webber quit his job as the Chief of Surgery, he returned to Adele to find out that she had moved on and appeared to be involved with another man. She is in the process of divorcing Richard when she is involved in a small car accident, and is hospitalized. She reveals to Addison that she is pregnant. After being released, she faints in a bathroom and is found by Richard. It is discovered that she is having complications with the pregnancy and will have to undergo surgery. Despite the fact that he believes that he is not the baby's father, Dr. Webber stays at his wife's side even when she tells him to leave her be. This support eventually brings them back together. After the surgery, Adele loses the baby and tells Richard that the baby was indeed his and that there was never any other man in her life.\n\nWhen Richard showed Adele that he was spending fewer hours at work and had even gotten himself an intern, they spent the night together. ''(\"[[The Becoming]]\")''\n\nHe later told Adele he wanted to come home and she said it was about time. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship remained steady until Adele started to deteriorate due to Alzheimer's disease. It eventually led to her death when she developed a large aneurysm and then died of a heart attack after her surgery. ''(\"[[Things We Said Today]]\")''\n\n[[Allan (Grey's Anatomy)|Allan]]\nWhile Adele is in the Roseridge Home for Extended Care, she meets Allan, another man who also has Alzheimer's. Since she doesn't remember Richard, she falls in love with Allan and they begin a physical and emotional relationship. ''(\"[[The Girl with No Name]]\")''\n\n\nAdele used to be a nurse for thirty years at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], where her husband [[Richard Webber|Richard]] worked. Some time after she retired, she was brought on as a nurse mediator and worked with [[Wayne Sheehan]] to develop a [[Date and Tell]] policy to protect the hospital from potential litigation.\n\n\n*She lost her virginity at the age of , but doesn't remember much about it.<ref>[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]], x</ref>\n*She loved mystery book series.<ref>[[If Only You Were Lonely]], x</ref>\n*She was married to Richard for  years.\n*She attended the wedding of a young [[Miranda Bailey]] and [[Tucker Jones]] with her husband, Richard. ''(\"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\")'' Bailey was a \"child\" when she married Tucker, according to her husband, implying they married very young. ''(\"[[Run, Baby, Run]]\")'' Webber also got the couple a set of ramekins for the wedding. It is unknown how Adele or Webber knew Bailey or Tucker as a couple or one or the other as individuals prior to her internship.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Enough is Enough]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[As We Know It]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Time Has Come Today]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Great Expectations]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Testing --]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[The Becoming]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Freedom, Part ]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[New History]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[Golden Hour]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Not Responsible]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[This is How We Do It]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[It's a Long Way Back]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Hope for the Hopeless]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[If/Then]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[The Girl with No Name]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[Run, Baby, Run]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[Things We Said Today]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n-.jpg\n-.jpg\n-.jpg\n-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.png\nx-.jpg\nx-.png\nx-.jpg\nx-.png\nx-.png\nx-.png\nx-.png\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Adele Webber Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Adele Webber]]\n[[fr:Adele Webber]]\n[[es:Adele Webber]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Webber, Adele}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Nurses]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Her workup showed gallstones and wall thickening, so she had laparoscopic surgery to remove them. She was hoping that would relieve her pain, which was constant. During her surgery, they noted that high-fat diets can cause gallstones, but [[Miranda Bailey]] informed them that she was vegan. She'd started a vegan diet when she realized it helped with the acid reflux she'd had for most of her life.\n\nA month later, Alicia came back to the ER with symptoms consistent with appendicitis. However, when she opened Alicia's abdomen, she found a healthy appendix. Despite this, she removed it and closed. [[Nicole Baylow]] wrote her off as a drug seeker and wanted to get her a psych consult, but after [[Richard Webber]] questioned that treatment plan, she went by what Bailey had suggested and tested for lupus and other rare disorders. The tests were all negative, so Alicia was sent home again.\n\nAlicia came back to the hospital a few months later. Baylow thought she had an obstruction and wanted to take her in for surgery to take a closer look, but Bailey noticed that her urine was intermittently dark and had other symptoms consistent with porphyria.

He then left them tape and a marker to make name tags for themselves before leaving them.\n\nAfter two hours of working on progress notes for patients, James hadn't even finished one, angering [[Karen (Season )|Karen]], who was waiting for them. Tom stepped in and noted that his problem was that he kept putting, \"Home and awaiting follow-up\" for patients who had died. All the patients had died, which created an error. Tom fixed the problem and told James to carry on. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nOne day, James brought a patient into the hyperbaric chamber for wound therapy. Due to a busy schedule, his patient was scheduled for the same slot as Meredith. While they waited in the chamber, James asked Levi if Meredith was mean, as that's what he'd heard, but she got sick before he could work with her. Levi emphatically stated that she could be tough, but she was not mean. When James' patient started to wake up and eviscerated himself, Levi helped keep James calm and then pack his intestines back in. Then he had James call for the chamber to be depressurized so the patient could be moved back to the OR. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\nJames observed a laminectomy for a meningioma that Amelia was performing. Link was also in the gallery. When Amelia did her superhero pose before starting the surgery, James asked what she was doing and Link said she was preparing to crush it. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nDuring his days off, James volunteered at the urban Indian Health Clinic. Through his work there, he met [[William Lawrence]]. He treated William for COVID, but William later returned to the clinic having what appeared to be a stroke. James accompanied him to the hospital where the stroke was confirmed and he had a thrombectomy. After his thrombectomy, James went to his room and used some traditional medicine for William. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, she cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, James was able to get his first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them  seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total,  patients were treated using this method. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\n\nHe is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].

She was brought to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] where she bonded with [[Alex Karev|Alex]] but later left when she recovered her memories. She later reappeared and although they loved each other, she slit her wrists and almost died, thus Alex was forced to have her transferred to a psychiatric facility.\n\n\n\nAlex Karev found a semi-conscious pregnant woman crushed under a cement pylon, suffering from several severe injuries, after the ferry accident. He rode to the hospital with her in the ambulance. He had to put her on her side to improve her circulation.\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Ava after the crash.]]\nUpon arrival at Seattle Grace, the Jane Doe was submitted to a battery of tests and surgeries to evaluate her condition and that of her baby, as well as treat her injuries. She was then taken into surgery to start repairing some of the damage. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\nScans showed a cardiac tamponade, which was treated during surgery. During surgery, her baby started having late decels, but Addison was able to control it and Burke finished the surgery. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nShe woke up after her surgery confused. She thought that Alex was her husband and they quickly realized that she had no memory of her life before the accident. She was worried about not knowing anything about her life, so Alex used her labs to tell her what they'd learned about her. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\nBecause of the damage to her face, she was difficult to identify and there was no match on her prints. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\n\nShe had a fracture to her orbital socket, meaning she needed surgery. [[Mark Sloan]] said it needed to happen as soon as possible, but [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] recommended that they wait a day or two to minimize risk to her baby. Rebecca decided to have the surgery immediately. During the surgery, the baby went into distress and Jane Doe had vaginal bleeding. Addison was called in and she had to do a cervical cerclage. After her surgery, her sight was safe. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\n\nEventually, [[Mark Sloan]] presented Jane Doe with options for her facial reconstruction. She had trouble choosing because none of them looked familiar and she didn't want to pick the wrong one. Alex helped her with the decision by assigning each face a name and identity. Jane Doe chose the face Alex called \"Ava\", and adopted the moniker for herself following the surgery. ''(\"[[My Favorite Mistake]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her facial reconstruction was completed and the bandages off, they took some pictures of her to get them out. A couple ([[Joan Waring|Joan]] and [[Frank Waring]]) came to the hospital thinking that Jane Doe was their daughter,\uaShannon Marie.\uaShe matched the basic description of their daughter,\uaso she allowed them to come in and see her. She asked if she could go home with them. Alex said he'd look into it, but it fell through when Joan realized that Jane Doe wasn't actually her daughter. After they left, Alex had to break the news to her. She was upset at still not knowing who she was and caused a fight between Alex and herself. ''(\"[[Time After Time]]\")''\n\n\nAva developed pre-eclampsia and the baby developed edema. She was given an epidural in an attempt to stabilize her, but she had a seizure, so she was rushed to the OR for an emergency c-section even though she was only  weeks pregnant. Ava started to panic after the birth because there was additional bleeding. However, Alex was able to calm her down while Addison finished the surgery. ''(\"[[Desire]]\")''\n\n\nBecause her more emergency health issues were addressed and her memory had still not come back, [[Derek Shepherd]] agreed to look more seriously into possible causes for the memory loss. By this point, Ava was able to get up and walk around. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nDerek found bleeding in her brain, which he said could have been from one of her other surgeries. She needed brain surgery, but he warned her that due to the location of the bleed, she needed to be awake during the surgery. He said there was a chance she could get her memory back from the surgery. Alex had her identify the items on cards while Derek stimulated different parts of her brain. They learned that she speaks German, Spanish, and French. When she woke up after surgery, she was upset that her memory had not come back. She worried about what would happen if she never remembered her life. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nWhile helping Alex study for his intern exam, Ava remembered her dad's face. Alex was excited, but Ava minimized it, saying it was nothing. Alex went to Derek and asked him to run tests. When Alex tried to run the tests, Ava refused to cooperate. He then figured out that her memory had come back and she was lying to him about it. She said she was in an unhappy marriage with a nice guy. She was upset because he hadn't come to look for her while she was missing. She later told Alex that her name was Rebecca Pope. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\n\nRebecca's husband, Jeff, came to the hospital to get her. Rebecca was cleared by all her doctors to go home and her baby was discharged. However, she told Alex to give her a reason to stay. He left after saying she should stay with Jeff. By the time he returned, having changed his mind, she had left with her husband. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nRebecca came back to Seattle to see Alex on Halloween. She said the only thing she'd wanted to be for Halloween was Ava. He kissed her deeply. They went to an on-call room, where Rebecca said that she was upset that Alex hadn't come for her. They still went on to have sex. Afterward, Alex was paged away. When he returned, Rebecca was gone, but had left a piece of her clothing. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\nRebecca came back again and Alex let her sneak into the gallery to watch a surgery, even though it was against the rules. When Lexie came in and sat down next to her, Rebecca told Lexie who she was. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\nMark later saw her there and busted Alex. Alex got suspended for a week over it. He told Rebecca that he believed she was just playing dress-up coming to Seattle. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\nRebecca came back again, saying she was pregnant. Alex asked her if she was keeping it or having an abortion and then left abruptly. She went down to the clinic, where the did a pregnancy test. Alex later came back and placed his hand on her belly, not knowing that the pregnancy test had come back negative. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\nAlex got a second job at [[Emerald City Bar]] in order to help him save up money so he and Rebecca could get a place together.\n\nRebecca came into the hospital wanting to get a consult from Mark Sloan. Izzie found her and informed her that the pregnancy test had been negative, but Rebecca didn't believe her. At the consult with Mark, she said she wanted a new body because it didn't match the face he made her. He said he couldn't operate because she said she was pregnant. Mark told Izzie they might be looking at Acute Stress Disorder as a result of her facial reconstruction. He told Izzie to make it clear to her that she was not pregnant and get her a psych consult. Izzie did an ultrasound and showed Rebecca that there was nothing in her uterus. Rebecca then thought she had lost the baby, despite being told she never was pregnant. Instead of getting the psych consult, Alex brought her home so he could take care of her. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\nAlex continued to take care of Rebecca, feeding her and bathing her while she remained in an almost catatonic state. Later, when he left her unattended with a knife to answer a phone call, she slit her wrists. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nAlex brought her into the ER to stitch up her wrists. He insisted that he could still handle it, but Izzie had technically admitted her, so she called for a psych consult. Alex sent away the consult, but called her husband, who said he'd taken the baby and left her two months ago. He went to Rebecca and said that she had underlying borderline personality disorder that was aggravated by her face being changed. He said she'd spend the night in the hospital and then be transferred to a psychiatric facility. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAfter Alex realized she had regained her memory, he tried to convince her to tell the authorities so that her family could be located; although she initially refused, she eventually confessed that her real name was Rebecca Pope. This finally led her husband, [[Jeff Pope]], to reunite with her, and though Rebecca pleaded with Alex to \"give me a reason to stay\", he refused and told her to stay with the better guy, only to regret his decision later, but it was too late: Rebecca and her daughter had left with Jeff, leaving Alex to stare at an empty room. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\nRebecca reappeared. Rebecca explained to Alex that in her town at Halloween, all the mothers dressed up. She confessed that the only person she wanted to be was Ava. Alex kissed Rebecca and the two proceeded to an [[On-Call Room]]. Alex made a move to have sex, but Rebecca stopped him, telling him he was a 'chicken' and 'didn't come looking for her'. She told him that she 'had to come looking for him'. The two eventually had sex and Rebecca alluded to the fact she no longer loves her husband. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\nA while later, Rebecca returned again to see Alex. She invited him to have coffee, but he turned her down due to a surgery. Rebecca begged him to let her watch it, and she dressed as a resident to have Alex sneak her into the gallery, where Lexie met her and found out about Alex's \"other girlfriend,\" and both Izzie and Mark discovered her. Alex was suspended from the [[Operating Room|O.R.]] for two weeks and later in his bedroom as Rebecca kissed him, he yelled at her, telling her that she was only at Seattle Grace \"to play dress up\" and that she should go back to her life so he could get on with his. However, after this angry speech, he continued to kiss her and they slept together.\n\nAbout six weeks later, Rebecca came back to Seattle Grace once again with news for Alex\ushe was pregnant. Alex was reluctant at first to have anything to do with her or the baby, but eventually he accepted it and excitedly began to build a new life for him, the baby, and Rebecca, who left to tell her husband she was leaving him. However, Izzie discovered that she was not actually pregnant and she had even temporarily forgotten she already had a baby. Alex eventually saw that Rebecca indeed was not pregnant, and became slightly worried when she didn't listen to him and instead insisted that she lost the baby. He took her home and decided to take care of her, disregarding Izzie's observations that Rebecca \"isn't looking very good.\"\n\nRebecca sank into depression after learning that \"she lost the baby\" and Alex was adamant that he could take care of her. However, when he was in another room, she attempted to cut her wrists with a kitchen knife. Alex brought her to the [[Emergency Room|ER]] and got even angrier at Izzie when she tried to get Rebecca a psych consult so she could be admitted. Izzie finally stood her ground and got Rebecca a psych consult. Later, Alex called Jeff Pope and discovered that two months earlier, he took the baby girl and left Rebecca. Rebecca was eventually put into psych. When Alex told her, she accepted it, but told him she was trying to be better for him. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n[[Jeff Pope]]\nShe was married to Jeff Pope. They met in college and got married the year after they graduated. She wanted to move to New York, but he wanted to live on the side of a mountain and take over his father's woodworking shop. She says she was going out of her mind in her marriage, which is why she left. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nHe later left her and took the baby. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nHer daughter has her father's nose. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nWhen she came to Seattle on Halloween, she said her daughter was perfect. She sucked on her fingers and made a cartoon-like suckling sound. She was soothed by being wrapped in a shirt her mother had been wearing.

The seven years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life. You will be pushed to the breaking point. Look around you. Say hello to your competition. Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty. Five of you will crack under the pressure and two of you will be asked to leave. This is your starting line. This is your arena. How well you play? That's up to you.|'''Richard Webber'''}}\n\n'''Richard Webber''' is an [[attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]]\uaand the current [[Resident#Program Director|Residency Program Director]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]; and the current Chief Medical Officer of the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]].\uaHe is also the former [[Chief of Surgery]] at both [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. During his residency, he had an affair with [[Ellis Grey]], but he left her because he was jealous of her career. He was married to [[Adele Webber]] until her death and is now married to [[Catherine Fox]].\n\n\n\nNot much is known about Richard's childhood. His mother, [[Gail Webber|Gail]], died of pancreatic cancer when he was ten. He has a brother named [[Chris Webber]] and a sister.\n\n\nDuring residency, he grew close with [[Ellis Grey]]. They started having an affair together, planning to leave their spouses to have a life together. Ellis told her husband, but Richard overheard that she was on the shortlist for the Harper Avery Award, and decided to stay with his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]]. He was jealous of her career and he didn't want to feel that way for the rest of his life.\n\n\nRichard started having trouble seeing, and not completing simple surgeries. It turned out that he had developed a tumor, pressing against his optic nerve, and let Derek operate to remove it, under the radar of all the surgical floor. Later, he fought with Derek to write him out for surgery.\n\n\nRichard was later found to be off the wagon and drinking again. This caused him to lose his job as Chief of Surgery for a period of time to [[Derek Shepherd]], who told the board about his problem even though Meredith had attempted to stop him. He eventually sobered up again and after Derek stepped down following the shooting, he was able to regain the position.\n\n\nHis wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]], was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. When Adele was accepted on to Derek's Alzheimer's trial, Meredith tampered with the trial by ensuring Adele received the active drug, rather than a placebo.\uaOnce news of the tampering came to light, Richard took the fall for Meredith, leading to his resignation as Chief of Surgery, whilst remaining an attending general surgeon. Throughout the next year, Richard dealt with her Alzheimer's becoming worse. She eventually asked Richard to place her in the [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]]. Richard visited her a lot as he wanted to assure her that he was still there for her, but soon after she stopped recognizing him and started a romantic relationship with Allan, a fellow resident in the care facility. At first, Richard resisted, thinking Allan was taking advantage, but he soon realized Allan had Alzheimer's too and that his anger wasn't helping Adele. He then allowed Allan to take his place.\n\n\nRichard and Catherine were both examiners at the boards exam. The night before the Boards, Catherine and Richard ended up sleeping together. That is when their relationship started.\n\n\nNot long after that, Adele died of a heart attack after coming out of surgery.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter his electrocution, Richard briefly opened his eyes to see how [[Heather Brooks|Heather]], the first one to find him in the basement, got electrocuted herself and severely bumped her head. Both she and Richard were later found by Shane, who alarmed other doctors. Together with Cristina, Bailey started taking care of Richard. While his labs showed that his lactate was two, Richard started coding but they managed to revive him, after which Cristina successfully pulled off the difficult procedure to place a balloon pump without rupturing Richard's aorta. This stabilized Richard's heart and he was sent to the ICU. When his labs came back again, Richard's lactate was six, and Bailey felt he had an acute abdomen. She was worried and wanted to operate on him to look for and repair possible intra-abdominal tissue damage, but Cristina insisted his heart couldn't handle the surgery. They kept bickering until Owen reminded them to look into his medical directive. Meredith turned out to be his medical proxy, and she decided to run his labs again, and if the lactate was above six, they could operate. A little later, his labs showed that his lactate was nine, so he was wheeled into the OR with some of the doctors watching him.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n[[File:xWebberelectrocuted.png|thumb|xpx|Richard is unconscious after being electrocuted.]]\nHowever, the surgery was interrupted by\ua[[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]], who yelled at Owen and Bailey to close him up. As they hadn't found anything on the bowels yet and Richard's heart started to get unstable again, they listened to her and closed him up. Richard stabilized again after he was closed up. Catherine demanded access to Richard's chart and labs, and started to plan to move him to another hospital once he was stable enough. However, behind her back, Meredith was convinced by Bailey's feeling that something's wrong inside his abdomen, and doing nothing about it is worse than operating. She took her phone and booked an OR for Bailey to explore Richard's abdomen again. They did find necrotic tissue around the pancreas, and Bailey was extremely happy. \"When you know, you know!\" she said, just as Richard always taught them. After surgery, Richard was taken back to the ICU. As Catherine started bickering with Bailey and Meredith over how he still hadn't regained consciousness, Richard opened his eyes just as Meredith told Catherine that Richard chose her to be his family and to make his decisions for him.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nHis recovery didn't start out well as he continued to lose weight. Meredith was on maternity leave, so Bailey was now in charge of his case. When presenting the case, Shane recommended a feeding tube, but Richard refused this with Bailey supporting him in this. Behind Bailey and Richard's backs, Shane called Meredith to inform her of Richard's condition and she advised him to already order a feeding tube so it would be ready whenever Richard was ready to have it. Shane did so, but Bailey and Richard found out. They were not going to change their course of treatment, and Shane was ordered to bring Richard some soup. From outside the room, Shane noticed how much difficulties Richard was having to swallow it. When Cristina informed her over the phone that Richard still didn't have a feeding tube, Meredith felt like she abandoned Richard and failed to be a good family member, so she came to the hospital to read his labs herself. She and Shane tried to convince Bailey, who supported Richard in his decision not to have a feeding tube because it completely takes away one's dignity. Meredith pointed out that dying does too, and that would happen if they wouldn't place a feeding tube. Bailey then agreed to have another look at Richard's swallow studies with her. While they were doing so, Shane entered Richard's room and listed the consequences of not allowing a feeding tube. He told Richard that he was offering to place the tube now that they were alone, or they could wait for Meredith to do it. Richard realized that a feeding tube was necessary and allowed Shane to place it. That evening, Meredith sat by his bedside, apologizing for being such a bad family. He aggressively told her that she wasn't his family and that he had made the wrong decision to make her his medical proxy as she was too weak and sentimental. He said that she shouldn't have brought him back to life, meaning he would rather be dead right now. Meredith then let go of his hand as he turned his head away from her.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nHe continued down the path of self-destruction. Meredith told Bailey, who kept on worrying, that forcing treatment wouldn't help, he just needed to hit rock bottom. Bailey then instructed a nurse to start Richard on CPAP, which the nurse said he wouldn't like. Bailey said he didn't have to like it, he just had to do it. However, when the nurse came to his room, he started fighting her and said he didn't want breathing treatments. Bailey came into the room and told him about her other patient, who wouldn't stop fighting despite having no options. This was contrasted with Richard, who had many options but refused to try. She stated she wasn't okay with letting him die like Meredith was, so she was giving a choice. He then reached for the breathing apparatus, but only to throw it across the room. Bailey then wrestled with him to get him to wear the oxygen mask until he aggressively pushed her away into a chair. However, Bailey put [[Gene Seers|her patient]] in Richard's room, where the patient pointed out that Richard didn't look like he would be around much longer. Bailey gave them brochures for facilities that do end-of-life care, figuring that they could go through them together as they were in the same boat. While talking with Gene, Richard realized he didn't want to die in the hospital and took the breathing apparatus to start working on his lungs, with Bailey watching and smiling from outside the room.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nTogether, they continued working on his recovery until he was able to stand up and walk to the chair in his room. They called Catherine to show her the progress they made. When he showed her what he could do, he refused to accept help from Bailey, who smilingly pointed out he was now acting all too cool for school because Catherine was in the room. Leah and Shane felt a little awkward when they had to strip his JP drain and they helped him get back in bed, while Bailey and Catherine talked outside about his recovery. She expected more of the recovery, but Bailey says all he needs is support. Noticing how awkward the interns were acting when they needed to examine Richard, Catherine wanted him to come home with her. She pointed out he wasn't progressing in this hospital, as they were all coddling him because they love and fear him. Ultimately, it was a disservice to him and Catherine added he needed to be pushed and not coddled. Keeping this in mind, he told Leah that coddling makes her a bad doctor and he ordered her to give him a proper hands-on examination. Catherine overheard how Leah correctly diagnosed a pancreatic leak and complimented the bossy Richard as she came into the room. As Leah left, Richard said that the interns would have to learn to look him in the eye and answer his questions. He then answered her question to come home with her, saying that he needed to stay in the hospital as they needed him there.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nDetermined to teach the interns, Richard used his physical condition as a teaching tool. He had constant shoulder pain and he wanted Jo to come up with the correct diagnosis. Meredith interrupted to ask Bailey something about portal vein graft research, and Richard replied that it was her mother's research. She has written about it in one of the journals gave him. Back to his case, Richard told Jo that she would be kicked off the case if she couldn't find a solid answer about his pain. Her first attempt was to attach him to a scanner. While she was trying to get a clear read, Richard pulled off the sensors. He told her the pain wasn't caused by his heart or something he did, and he advised her to look deeper. She then came up with doing X-rays. He asked her what she thought she would find. Something clicked in her head and she suddenly realized he needed an ultrasound instead. Doing the ultrasound, she enthusiastically diagnosed him with a pancreatic pseudocyst. She started cheering because she found the answer, and explained how she got to it. He told her to work on her bedside manner and she apologized. He smiled and said he finally felt like he was in good hands.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Jo diagnosed him with the pancreatic pseudocyst, Richard revealed he would allow one of the second-year residents to perform the surgery to fix it. Stephanie was already out, as she walked into a wall after her eye surgery. Bailey doubted they were capable of doing the surgery, but they were able to walk her through the procedure. Richard then tasked Bailey to observe the residents in the ER and decide which one was going to operate. In the ER, Leah and Shane dropped out too. Bailey started ranting about how incompetent the residents were, but Richard came to their defense and said that she was the problem. Teaching the residents is the only thing that kept him going when it was still unsure he'd ever operate again, and she was standing in the way of that as she wouldn't let them learn. He said he'd have someone else supervise them and fired her from his case. He then asked Meredith to observe the residents and choose one to perform the cystogastrostomy. She told him she didn't have time as she had a Halloween party to get to, but when he said he would have never gotten where he was now if it weren't for her and begged her to help him teach the residents, she agreed. She chose Jo, who pulled off the surgery with success. After the surgery, Richard asked Meredith to talk to him through the whole surgery from the beginning, but Meredith allows Jo to do this in the interest of education.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nWhenever he wasn't teaching, Richard filled his days by telling old surgical stories over and over again to anyone who would listen. One of his many stories taught Stephanie the two-challenge rule. His next-door neighbor, CJ, got tired of it when he asked the residents to come back for the end of a story and yelled from her room that everyone knows the end because he'd told it so many times. He held off on exercise, which Meredith noticed. She asked if he was planning to leave the hospital because his room didn't look like he was. CJ walked by and asked him to join her on her walk, so he could hear some new stories, which she told him he needed. He said he'd catch up with her later, again refusing to get out of bed. Later that day, she was talking him through a recipe when she suddenly stopped talking as Richard heard a clattering. Richard then rushed out of bed and saw CJ collapsed on the floor. He called for help and asked for a crash cart as he started performing CPR on CJ. After he saved CJ, Richard felt exhausted in a good way. He told April that it was time for him to start working to get out of bed and be himself again. At the end of the day, Richard checked on CJ and took a walk with Callie, while telling her the story of what happened that day.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\nIn a wheelchair, Richard left the hospital for the first time in months when April drove him to the courthouse to support Callie during her malpractice lawsuit.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\nTo get out of the hospital, Richard had to pass a treadmill stress test. He failed every time but pushed Jo and Meredith to allow another one. In his room, he tried to convince Meredith he was a waste of a bed, but she replied his stress test was a disaster. He claimed he had been practicing and was thereby another man than he was last week. Meredith proposed to get him into a rehab facility as he couldn't go home on his own, but Richard refused and said he'd get a home health aid. This convinced Meredith to allow another test, which he said he'd pass, flying colors. She then invited him to the Thanksgiving Dinner at her house, and he accepted the invitation when he found out she wasn't cooking the dinner. While preparing for the treadmill test, he and Jo started talking about preparing a Thanksgiving turkey. During the treadmill test, Jo wanted to stop because his heart rate was pretty high. He wanted her to take up the treadmill, but when she refused, he did it himself. He had to start running, but couldn't keep up and fell off the treadmill. Jo called for help, and Derek and Callie came in, confirming his own diagnosis of broken ribs. Because she felt sorry about what happened, Jo and the other interns decided to hang out with Richard at the hospital at Thanksgiving. As none of them could cook a turkey, they decided to settle on fried chicken and biscuits.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he healed up, Richard passed the stress test and he was allowed to leave the hospital with a box filled with his personal stuff. He was wheeled to the elevator with several doctors seeing him off. He didn't understand why they were making such a big deal out of it and said he wanted a break from all of them. Bailey said he got himself better, but he said she was the one who did that. Not long after, Richard came back to the hospital. He met Bailey in the surgical skills lab, as he wanted to practice his skills for his return to surgery and didn't want to just sit around at home. Unknown to him, Bailey was trying to do  stitches without showing OCD behavior. He rearranged the surgical instruments on her tray. Later, Bailey yelled at Dr. Alma that she wasn't going to take the pills. Richard offered to join her to April's bridal shower to take a break, but she declined. After having yelled compliments and eaten a lot of finger food at the shower, Richard returned to the skills lab. He said that she called him a drunk before the accident. She started apologizing for that, but he said she was right: he is an alcoholic, which is why he was at the hospital instead of home because he was afraid he'd start drinking at home out of loneliness and boredom. He said he always wants a drink because he has a disease that can't be cured, only managed, but not alone. He told Bailey that she had to accept that she has a disease and needs help, after which she picked up the pill bottle and took one out of it.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nRichard scheduled his first little surgery back on the day of April's wedding. Almost everyone would be at the wedding, so there wouldn't be anyone around to make a big fuss about it. On the same day, Bailey started operating again and he told her he was proud of her. However, his plans had to change. While he was preparing for the surgery, Leah came running over and begged him for help. He accompanied her to the OR, where he found Shane staring at Jimmy Evans's chest. While ordering Leah to get rescrubbed, he asks Shane what they got. Shane kept on saying how he did this and that it's his fault while blocking Jimmy's chest with his hands. Richard took a look and concludes they needed bypass. He tried to convince Shane to take some rest, but Shane said that she would be dead when he'd come back. He added that it's his fault because he sent her to the basement. Richard then realized he was talking about Heather and what happened to her, remembering how he saw her get electrocuted. Richard assured Shane that she would be fine and that he needed to take some rest. As Shane left the OR, Richard got inside Jimmy's thorax and yelled to page someone from cardio. Jimmy deteriorated, leaving Richard performing heart massage on Alex's father.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Richard and Catherine get married.]]\n\n\nAfter some time being together, Catherine proposed to Richard in front of the entire hospital, and he agreed. They argued before the wedding and called it off briefly. However, they reconciled when Meredith helped them realize that life is too short to not be happy and together. They were married in the hospital chapel.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Bailey became Chief of Surgery, she hired Eliza Minnick to help re-shape the resident teaching program. While the residents enjoyed Minnick's program, the attendings, including Richard, felt they were being pushed out of their own surgeries. Eventually, Richard spoke up, and Bailey chose Minnick over Richard's position as director of the resident program. Most of the attendings sided with Richard, which led to Meredith being temporarily suspended for refusing to work with Minnick. Eventually, Bailey realized that Minnick's program was not as helpful as she thought, and she gave Richard back his old job title.\n\n\nOne day, Richard's sponsor, [[Olive Warner]], was admitted to the hospital and she asked for him. She told him she had reached her expiration date as her liver had already lasted longer than it should have and it also caused cardiomyopathy, which is why she was admitted. Eight months prior, she had signed a DNR and also drafted an advance directive for no intervention. Richard hated that she hadn't told him, but she said she took her personal problems to her own sponsor. Also, she didn't know how to sponsor him through her death. Richard then said he wouldn't let her die and brought in Maggie and Meredith. Ollie threatened to tell his secret to every doctor he brought in, but he had her blessing to tell them everything since they already knew. They had less trouble accepting that Ollie had reached the end of the road. She asked them to work on getting Richard to accept it and make sure he'd get through it without reaching for the bottle. They pretended that they were going to do more tests the next day and reached out to Catherine. Later, Bailey came to see him. He told her that Ollie was the keeper of his secrets and that she was how he felt God's presence. Bailey made sure he had a village of people who loved him.\n\nThe next day, Maggie and Meredith informed him that all possible options had a poor prognosis. He thought a small chance at survival was better than guaranteed death, but Ollie once again said she had made peace with it. He still thought keeping her alive was his job. Maggie later sat down with Richard and reminded her of everything she put her mother through against her wishes, which she had come to realize she only did for herself. He realized that he needed to give Ollie the ending that she wanted instead of repeating Maggie's mistake. Richard then brought Amelia to Ollie's room and they held a meeting, where he stated he had accepted the things he couldn't change.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref> Catherine arrived and made sure Richard was comfortable as he sat by Ollie's bed until she passed away. He cried over her body and later sought out Catherine. He told her he was doing fine and asked about her. She then revealed Jackson had unearthed a scandal relating to the Foundation that could ruin them all. She filled Richard in on all the details.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard demonstrates his Path Pen.]]\nShortly before Ollie's funeral, Richard gave a presentation on his Path Pen for the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. Upon his return to the hospital, he found out that several doctors had accidentally eaten weed cookies. Richard then got occupied with taking care of [[Vikram Roy]], who had neglected to tell his superiors that he, too, had eaten a contaminated cookie. He freaked out because of it while treating a patient and backed into a cart and fell, which ended with his arm being stabbed by a scalpel. Richard managed to stop the bleeding but later fired Vik for not coming clean about the cookie.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nWhen news got out about Harper Avery's sexual harassment scandal, Richard sat down with Jackson and Catherine in several meetings with a crisis manager Catherine had hired to protect the Foundation. They shut down the woman's plan to go after the assaulted women to make the scandal go away. In between meetings, Amelia found Richard and told her about Betty and her plan to take her in and help her get sober. He liked the idea and advised her to really drag Betty if she saw something in her, as Ollie had done with him. If it worked, Amelia would be saving a life. Richard, Catherine, and the crisis manager drafted a press statement, but Jackson and Meredith came in with a plan to create a new foundation in Catherine's name that would pledge itself to re-hire and re-train all the women affected by the scandal.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Bailey was met with a lawsuit for wrongful termination by Vik, she asked Richard to come to her meeting with him. Richard later admitted he may have overreacted in firing Vik, because, unlike himself, Vik never operated under the influence. He suggested Bailey could make the case go away by apologizing. Bailey didn't want to apologize if she didn't mean it, but after [[Levi Schmitt]] pointed out that she had begun a surgery while high, she deemed it fit to re-hire Vik for a one-year probationary period. That worked and Vik dropped the lawsuit.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref> \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard confronts Arizona over her leaving without telling him.]]\nSoon after, Richard found out that Arizona was looking for a job in New York as she was planning to move there with Sofia. Unhappy with his close friend moving away, he confronted her about keeping it from him. Later, Richard treated [[Matthew Taylor]] while his colleagues worked on bringing April back. He was the one to inform Arizona of their accident. They all sat by April's bed in the ICU. When she showed no signs of recovery, Richard offered to be the one to call her parents. However, she eventually woke up without deficits.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard and the other guests congratulate the newlyweds.]]\nAt Alex and Jo's wedding, Richard confronted Meredith with her offering Jo an attending job. He thought she was only doing it to keep Alex in Seattle and said it was unfair to Jo as she deserved the extra training fellowship in Boston. He later overheard Arizona tell April that she was falling for Callie again and that that was a catastrophe. Together with April, he convinced her that it was actually a good thing. Arizona told the two of them that she was going to miss them and they hugged. When the wedding was called off due to several things going wrong, Richard and the other guests took the ferry back to the city, where he witnessed an impromptu wedding between Alex and Jo officiated by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nEver since Ollie's death, Richard had stopped going to meetings but he also didn't start drinking again. Catherine stuck around to look after him. At work, Richard and Andrew treated [[Barry Clemens|a man]] who inserted one of his wife's hair products into his rectum. In surgery, Vik cauterized a bleed against Richard's advice, which ignited the hair spray and caused a fire in the man's abdomen. Vik was wounded by the can that was propelled across the room and taken away, while Richard and Andrew attempted to save Barry, to no avail.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> Upon hearing that Bailey was looking for an interim Chief, Richard threw his name in the mix, but Bailey told him it wouldn't be him because she wanted the job back one day. She inquired if he had a new sponsor, but he stated he was just talking to Catherine. He thought the two of them had been talking behind his back, but they hadn't. Bailey said she just remembered what happened the last time he was Chief. With Ollie's death, she didn't want to add extra stress to his plate, which is why she chose not to appoint him interim Chief. He claimed he left for a meeting, but at the exit, he came across Andrew on his newly acquired motorcycle. He offered Richard to take a ride. Reluctantly, Richard got on, and, much to his surprise, he liked the feeling and asked for the helmet so he could take the ride.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nAlex was chosen as interim Chief instead. On Alex's first day, Richard treated [[Dave Buckley]], a teacher who collapsed at work while he was helping a kid lead a block into a table saw. His labs showed extremely high alcohol levels, which triggered Richard and made him determined to follow the case all the way through. In surgery, while Link was working on Dave's fingers with local anesthetics, Richard told Dave that this was what rock bottom looked like and that he needed to take responsibility. Dave maintained it was an accident and that he didn't drink. Richard berated Dave to get him to confess until Alex threw him off the case.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard challenges Dave's sobriety.]]\nAfter a mom of one of Dave's students insisted that she knew alcoholics and that Mr. Buckley wasn't one, Richard went to his room and challenged him by placing a bottle of vodka in front of Dave. However, he refused to drink, which Richard had never known an alcoholic to do. He ran labs again, which still showed that Dave was drunk. Richard then diagnosed auto-brewery syndrome. At the end of the day, Richard told Andrew he was missing his wife. Link and Andrew then invited Richard to come with them to Joe's, where they could also do other things beside drink alcohol.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAs Chief, Alex asked Richard for advice when his patient refused surgery because his insurance didn't cover it. Richard only told him to be creative, refusing to do the job for him. Alex then stabbed the patient with a scalpel so the surgery would qualify as trauma surgery. Richard found out and yelled at him, saying he had opened himself up to serious consequences, but the patient was happy to have had the surgery and didn't press charges.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nRichard found out that his new friend Link and Jo went all the way back to undergrad. While Jo assured him their history wasn't romantic, Richard understood Alex's dismay over it as he felt the same about finding out that Catherine had a history with Tom. Throughout the day, Richard supervised Andrew as he took charge of the ER. He urged Andrew to take initiative while handling the interns and to remember that they were working at a teaching hospital. At the end of the day, he told Andrew he saw potential in him, so he wanted to push him to be the best he could be and also help Andrew to teach the interns to be their best selves. After work, Link, Andrew, and Richard went to Joe's, where Link and Andrew played their guitars while Richard sang \"The Thrill Is Gone.\"<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nRichard found out through an AA friend that [[Thatcher Grey]] had AML and that he only had a few weeks to live. He found Meredith and told her. The news about Thatcher made Richard visit Ollie's grave. He told her that it had been hard since she passed away and that he had avoided meetings because they only reminded him that she was gone.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWith Catherine away to Los Angeles for Foundation business, Richard spent a few days by himself. At work, he treated [[Frankie Shavelson]], a pregnant, beloved nurse he was close with. She had a wandering spleen, which began to untwist by itself. While he was checking up on her, she expressed worries over him. He admitted it had been hard since Ollie's death and due to Catherine's frequent travels. He maintained that he was fine, though. However, the spleen problem played up again and Richard had to operate. Alex delivered the baby while Richard had trouble controlling the bleeding. Richard did his best, but Frankie passed away. He couldn't bring himself to call time of death, so Alex did that for him. He delivered the news to the other nurses.\n\nEqually distraught as the nurses, Richard finally found the motivation to go to a meeting again. The person speaking there mentioned a bar exchanging shots for AA chips. Richard then got up and left. Richard found the bar and showed the bartender his -year chip. The bartender poured him eight vodka shots per his order. Richard looked at the shots and grabbed his chip back. He then went behind the bar and grabbed a baseball bat, smashing the shots and all bottles on the shelves. The bartender threatened the call the police. Richard invited him to do so so that he could tell them how the man was taking advantage of vulnerable people who were struggling to hang onto everything they've got. Eventually, the police arrived and Richard was arrested. He called Meredith, who was out in Los Angeles with Catherine and had just helped diagnose Catherine's spinal tumor, and told her that he had been arrested. He made her promise not to tell Catherine.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith flew back to Seattle and bailed him out. She then brought up the fact that he hadn't found a new sponsor yet. He admitted he lost control. Knowing Catherine would soon need help, she told him to get his head in a place where he could take care of the people who depend on him. Richard went to the hospital and told Bailey, who was stepping in for Alex due to his being trapped at home by the windstorm, about his arrest. He agreed to her plan to inform the board and bench him for the day. He went to check on Frankie's baby, who was surrounded by nurses. He then noticed he had three missed calls from Catherine and called her back. Much to his surprise, Tom answered the call. Richard thought Catherine was having an affair with him, so he decided to read the Bible to find serenity and then find himself a new sponsor. Bailey scoffed at the idea of Catherine having an affair. She then told him about her marriage sabbatical. He pointed out she was trying to fix the inside from the outside, which wouldn't work, so he advised her to get real help.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nRichard took charge when the storm caused a power outage at the hospital, trapping three elevators between floors. He had an altercation with the head of maintenance while urging him to get the doors open. In between, he tried to reach Catherine, but she still didn't answer his calls. He then came across Betty, who was looking for Amelia, and decided they would occupy their minds by being useful. They bonded a bit and she told him that she felt that if she could get clean for a few months, she could put her life back together and get Leo back. He advised her to take it one day at a time.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard catches Betty looking for drugs.]]\nHe was paged away and sent her back to the ER, but he later found her looking for drugs in a cabinet. She begged him not to tell Amelia, but he couldn't call himself a doctor if he complied with that request. After he watched Amelia convince Betty to accept a place in rehab, Richard was approached by Jackson, who asked if he had talked to his mother. Since he hadn't, Jackson took him to a private room so they could talk. Jackson then told him that Catherine had a grade  chondrosarcoma on her spine.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nIn light of Catherine's diagnosis, Richard resumed going to meetings regularly, where another attendee offered to be his new sponsor. At work, Richard, Catherine, and Jackson performed a pelvic exenteration together. Catherine struggled in surgery, so Jackson offered to take over for her. Furious over his confronting her with her cancer in public, she finished her part and left. Jackson and Richard found her cooling down in a lounge and confronted her about hiding her cancer from them. She told Richard she couldn't exactly lean on him with his going around demolishing bars. After Catherine dismissed Richard's jealousy of Tom, Jackson and Richard convinced her that they could handle bad news, so there was no need to lie to them. She then said telling them about the cancer made it real for her, after which she broke down and they comforted her.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Catherine's surgery, Richard went to a meeting in the morning. At work, he convinced Meredith to go see her father before it was too late and then joined Catherine in her room. Tom and Amelia came in to explain their approach. Richard took Catherine to the OR. She told him he didn't need to sit in the gallery the entire time and told him she'd see him on the other side. After a kiss and hug, they danced with the staff and Jackson to \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" the song that had kept Catherine calm through all the scans. The surgery started. Jackson couldn't handle sitting there so he left with Maggie, but Richard knew that Catherine secretly wanted him there because showing up for one another when they really needed it is how they made their long-distance relationship work. Bailey came to with him. When things got dire, Richard closed the gallery. He couldn't bring himself to watch the team flip Catherine on the table, so Bailey held his hand and informed him once it was over. When Tom and Amelia's approach had to be changed to removing the tumor piecemeal, Richard convinced them to use his Path Pen. They removed as much tumor as they could, but they to leave a small part behind in order to leave her brachial plexus unscathed and thus save her career. Catherine thanked them for saving her life and made peace with the fact that she would have to live with cancer for the rest of her life. Richard went outside to took a moment to gather himself and then joined Amelia to a meeting, where she talked about giving him his wife back and being grateful for being sober to experience every terrifying, exhilarating, imperfect moment of the surgery.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine had a hard time recovering over the holidays. She shut Richard out and refused any help. She went to bed early on Christmas Eve, leaving Richard to finish dinner with Maggie and Jackson. She also lashed out at her physical therapist, because she dismissed Catherine's request for exercises to get her sensual self back. Richard brought up average recovery time to convince her not to wear herself out, but she said she wasn't average and left the room. Jackson and Maggie regularly visited to check on them. During one particular visit, Catherine fell off the treadmill. She broke down in Richard's arms and told him she couldn't do this. However, over time, things went better. On Valentine's Day, Catherine apologized to him for having been impossible. He didn't want to hear her apologize as he couldn't imagine what she was going through, but he promised to be there for her for every step of it. He told her she couldn't be average if she tried. She then found her sexual appetite back and asked him to take her the bedroom, which he did.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Bailey grew increasingly frustrated with Alex occupying her job. With two weeks left, she raged that Alex was given credit in an article about the hospital's innovation. Richard said that's just how it goes sometimes and shared a story of how she performed emergency surgery on a patient he had been treating for years, which is why the patient now sent her a basket of pears every year instead of him.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy and Richard save Betty.]]\nWhile Meredith was breaking the hospital's longest surgery record, the ER was flooded with victims from a mass overdose. Richard fetched all residents from the gallery and later found Owen working on Betty. Owen had Richard call Amelia. Richard watched over Betty while the doctors diagnosed an aortic dissection caused by the mixture of opioids and meth. Richard scrubbed in with Teddy to place a stent. That went well, but they found they had to also reconstruct the entire distal aorta. They managed to pull it off and Betty made it through surgery. At the end of the day, Richard, Teddy, and Link took a moment to rest in a quiet ER.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nRichard was amongst the first guests to arrive for Catherine's party at Jackson's penthouse. Alex shared an article from [[Kimberly Thompson]] about her experience with Maggie, which focused on she advocated for herself to convince Maggie to operate. While Richard found the article moving, Maggie hated Kiki for telling her story and making it seem like she healed herself with her magical narcissism. Later, Richard overheard Owen complaining about Tom taking advantage of Teddy and told him that Tom had been after Catherine, too. Richard later caught Meredith and Andrew making out in the guest room and quickly left. Maggie later heard him talking about the article and told him to stop because it made her feel small and insignificant and it pissed her off. Richard talked about being bullied as the only black resident in his class and how it made him realize there's no point in being pissed off unless you do something with it. He then advised Maggie to take back her story and tell it louder. When the party had to be evacuated because of a supposed fire, Richard, Catherine, Jackson, and Maggie got in the limo and celebrated with burgers, champagne, and cider for Richard. Maggie had decided to follow Richard's advice. Catherine liked them being together and said they'd celebrate every scan together like this, no matter the outcome.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Maggie guested on a medical podcast, she accidentally let slip that Ellis Grey was her mother. The news of her biological parents spread in the medical community and Richard was asked for a comment. He lashed out at Maggie for not thinking about the consequences when she revealed his affair to the world. She later found him and he told her it was her story to tell, but he just hated that Catherine had to deal with it on top of everything else. He said he was not particularly proud of that story. She was hurt and told him that the story culminated in her existence. He later found her and said he was proud of her despite the shame about the circumstances of how she was conceived. She knew she was a scandal. Richard told her she was the best of him, Ellis, and her parents who raised her beautifully and that he was proud to be any part of her. That was what he would tell the press if they reached out for any more comment.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Richard found out that Jackson had the interns de-scale tilapia for his spray-on skin project, he gathered the fish and hosted a fish fry on the hospital roof.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> Catherine decided not to go back to work any time soon, but she wouldn't elaborate as to why only telling Richard \"cancer card.\" When Jackson and Richard treated [[Toby Donnelly]] together, Richard had troubles using the right pronouns since they were gender non-binary. He admitted it was hard to keep up with the world, but he just needed some guidance and patience to adjust. With the help from Taryn and Jackson, he got the hang of the pronouns.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nOn the heels of Andrew and Meredith making their relationship public, Richard scheduled a lap appy for Andrew. Andrew examined the patient, who complimented him on his looks in front of Richard. She then asked Andrew to check out her Instagram. Richard told him it was part of the job so Andrew complied and listened to the patient talk about Crossfit. In surgery, Richard asked about the long-term plan. Andrew thought he was talking about his relationship with Meredith and said they hadn't discussed it yet. He said he respected where Meredith came from and that she was amazing to him. Richard then said he meant Andrew's career. Andrew said he was attracted to general surgery. The surgery had to be converted to an open procedure when they came across dead bowel. Richard wanted to take over, but Andrew knew the steps of an ileocecectomy and pulled it off. Once Andrew was done, Richard complimented Andrew and said he'd put in a good word with the head of general surgery. He ran into Meredith after and told her that Andrew did well and that he was a good man, subtly giving her his blessing. He later went by Bailey's office because she had found out that Alex had been handing off paperwork to interns. They agreed it was a genius move but that he could never found out that they thought that. That night, Richard took Catherine for a stroll in the park to de-stress after she completed a complicated transplant surgery as her first surgery back.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard made peace with his AA acquaintance.]]\nWhen an AA acquaintance of Richard's was admitted to the hospital with a heel impaling her chest, Richard kept showing up to provide support against Gemma's wishes. Ollie was Gemma's sponsor, too, but unlike Richard, she didn't have a family to fall back on after Ollie's death. She started drinking again and fell down the stairs while carrying her heels after a night out. While she didn't want him on the case and even had Maggie throw him out of the room, he showed up in the scrub room to talk to Maggie. He told her that while maybe he didn't resort to drinking, Ollie's death made him an angry dry drunk and if he hadn't had a lot of money to settle with that bar, he would have been in prison by now. Maggie was then paged , so Richard had to take over from her. The surgery went well and Richard admitted to Gemma that he was the one who had operated on her. She let it slide and they laughed about what had happened to her. She wanted her  years back. He told her to focus on today instead of the number of years and shared the story of how he almost lost his  years not too long ago.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nOne day at work, Richard noticed that \"Ellis Shepherd\" was scheduled for an ex lap. Richard rushed to the scrub room and found out that Meredith had put her daughter's name down so an immigrant's daughter could benefit from her insurance since the man earned too much to qualify for the state coverage but too little to pay for the surgery himself. Meredith refused to ship the kid off to County because she needed Alex Karev-level care after being separated from her parents for months at the border. Richard acknowledged the system was wrong but that she had chosen the wrong way to attempt to fix it. In surgery, they found out that the girl's obstruction was caused by lymphoma, meaning her case would drag on after this surgery. After the surgery, Richard yelled at her because his AA program required rigorous honesty in all his affairs, so keeping this secret was threatening his sobriety. He pointed out she could lose her license or her kids if she were sent to jail as well as the fact that implicating [[Luis Rivera]] in insurance fraud wouldn't help with his asylum. Richard then come up with a plan to make [[Gabriella Rivera]] sicker on paper so they could keep her there for  days, which would automatically activate a new state policy regardless of income.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Catherine surprised Richard when she showed up at the hospital. She had to come down there for Foundation business. She and Bailey locked themselves in a conference room with people in suits would divulging the reason behind the meetings. Richard grew increasingly worried while wild rumors about the meeting started to spread. Richard scrubbed in to repair a punctured rectum. In surgery, he taught [[Nico Kim]] that you need to find humor in the job in order to be able to survive in it.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAfter surgery, Richard saw Andrew being escorted away in handcuffs by the police. Andrew told him he had committed fraud and Bailey filled him in on the details. She asked Richard to come to the ER with her for incoming casualties, but he wandered off. He found Meredith stuck in the hyperbaric chamber with Alex and [[Gus Carter]]. She asked him to go set the record straight, but he didn't want to land her in jail and leave her kids without their mother. As Gus started coding, Richard ordered the techs to decompress the chamber. \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard is fired along with Alex and Meredith for covering up the latter's insurance fraud.]]\nRichard and Bailey operated together and she told Richard she was suspecting that Andrew did not do it alone and that he was just covering for Meredith. She asked if he knew anything about that, but Richard dodged the question. After surgery, Richard found Alex asked him to come. They interrupted Meredith's meeting with Catherine and Bailey and defended her actions, stating that they knew but had failed to report it. They just couldn't put that father through more misery. Bailey then decided to fire all three of them.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nRichard took to an AA meeting to vent his anger over his mentee firing him while his wife sat back and did nothing, predicting he wouldn't be able to forgive them any time soon. He got a job working for a health app, which required him to make house calls for minor illnesses, providing him with excuses to avoid Catherine at home. He soon quit and interviewed for the Chief of Surgery position at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]], the lowest-ranked hospital in Seattle. He was offended when the interviewer bluntly asked if he wasn't planning on retiring any time soon since the job was enormous and they were looking for somebody in the long run, as they wanted to overturn the facility to improve its ranking. After a week, he went to check if they had called Alex, whom he had put down as a reference. Alex didn't know since he never answers calls of unknown numbers. Noticing Alex had let his life fall apart, Richard suggested he interview for the job and then hire him as an attending. While initially hesitant, Alex was convinced when Richard pointed out he needed to get his life back in order to give Jo a reason to come back. Alex was hired and he hired Richard. Catherine found out and angrily confronted him, saying his working there humiliated her and her Foundation. He shot back that she just let him be fired and went to sleep on the couch.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOn his first day at Pac-North, Richard discovered the hospital only had two residents, both of whom were terrible doctors because they were too swamped with scut to hone their mediocre skills. He went to complain to Alex about it and to demand an office. Alex reminded him of the hospital's terrible ranking and that they were supposed to turn it around. Throughout the day, Richard was confronted with how terrible the hospital was compared to Grey Sloan, like a malfunctioning CT and a crowded ER with personnel that paged him for non-surgical cases. During an emergency surgery with Alex, Richard told him he didn't want to work there after having worked at Grey Sloan for  years. He figured he'd drop dead one day in OR , a thought that made him happy. They managed to save the patient, which was about the only thing that went right that day. Afterward, Alex admitted he also had had his doubts about Pac-North but he had become invested to change things around so that failure was no longer the culture there. He made Richard see he could help him do that and find a new legacy for himself in doing so, which would also prove Bailey wrong. Alex had also arranged for a janitorial closet to be turned into Richard's office.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nAlex and Richard started changing things for the better with baby steps, like a new MRI machine. While Catherine was away for Foundation business, Richard found out that his calls had landed [[Gemma Larson]] a job in the billing department of Pac-North. Richard had a brain dead patient whose sisters needed to decide if they wanted him to pull the plug. Since the sisters had drifted apart, they kept arguing, which prevented them from making a decision. Richard broke up the fighting and told them to come together for the decision so that their sister's death would mean something for their sisterhood. They decided to pull the plug. However, after Richard did that, the patient's phone rang and they discovered that the woman they had just unplugged had stolen her bag, meaning Richard had unplugged a random woman. Richard informed Alex and told the sisters to use this opportunity to forgive one another and reconnect with each other and their third sister. He informed Alex and then left him to clean up the mess. He tried calling Catherine but she didn't answer. He then ran into Gemma, who had heard about what had happened and asked him for details over dinner. He agreed and they left together.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWith the basics at the hospital set straight, Richard and Alex started to have time to teach the two residents. Richard was upset when he discovered the article that had come out in Meredith's name trashing Grey Sloan, a sentiment not shared by Alex. Richard let [[Cecil Taylor]] scrub in with him to operate on [[Yan Huang]], who had refused to be treated at Grey Sloan because of Meredith's trending article.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nWhile on his way out after an all-night surgery, Richard ran into Gemma, who insisted on buying him breakfast with her paycheck. He conceded and they left together. Over breakfast, they briefly talked about her unsuccessful search for a new sponsor and work until she steered the conversation towards his marriage. He talked about their recent fight, how the passionate light in Catherine seemed to have gone out, and how he didn't know how to get it back. He talked about how, as a -year-old boy, he feared his father wouldn't have his love sitting next to him on his porch for the rest of his life when his mother died. Gemma told him she was the opposite and always wanted a rotation of men rather than marriage. Richard said he had never been that. She proceeded to touch his hand meaningfully. He pulled back and she questioned why he pulled away from the first little bit of comfort he'd had in weeks. He cited his marriage as the reason. She said she was thinking that because he and Catherine had hit the \"worse\" part of their vows, he may be looking around. She had no intention of competing with Catherine but she didn't think he should be miserable until they found their way back to one another. She explicitly stated she was here and that life was too short to deprive themselves of what they had been feeling for so many years. Richard told her she had mistaken her friendship for something else. He apologized if he had done anything to mislead her but stated there was nothing between them, nor would there ever be. She reminded him that when hard times hit, he had a habit of burying himself in either another woman or a bottle of vodka, only one of which he could properly handle. He went to grab his coat and she surprised him with a kiss. He pushed her off of him and left. She followed him, thinking he was just lying about not being attracted to her. He told her he was in love with his wife. Gemma threw his tumultuous love life in his face. Richard refused to let her use his history to make herself less lonely and pointed out she was in dire need of a sponsor.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Richard helped Alex to lead a group of investors around the hospital. They tried to distract them from a chaotic ER and failing residents. Richard learned from Alex that the construction workers had discovered a mass grave on the construction site of the new research wing. They decided not to tell the investors and Richard continued the tour by himself to let Alex handle the administrative side. He managed to keep the investors busy the entire day only to walk in and have them overhear Alex while he was loudly announcing his handling of the mass grave to keep gossiping nurses in check.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Richard began ignoring Gemma. When she confronted him about it, he turned down her offer to let her make up for her behavior over coffee. He was surprised when Maggie showed up at Pac-North with his brother [[Chris Webber]] and niece [[Sabrina Webber|Sabi Webber]], whom he hadn't seen in five years. Sabi then revealed to Richard and Maggie that she had a large cardiac tumor. While Sabi had a new scan taken, Richard explained to Maggie that he had left his family behind because they thought he deemed himself better than them, and he wanted to protect Maggie from their hostile behavior. The scan then revealed that the tumor had grown considerably and invade its surroundings. Maggie wanted to operate but Sabi did not want to be operated on by family. While Maggie didn't see how that applied as they had only known each other for a few hours, Richard sided with Sabi and paged the on-call cardiac surgeon from Pac-North, which angered Maggie. She did agree to consult with the surgeon, though. However, as Sabi's condition grew dire quickly, Richard honestly said he wanted Maggie to operate, which convinced Sabi to consent. When Chris left the waiting room to go call family, Gemma came to sit with Richard. He told her part of the conflict with his family consisted of his brother blaming his alcoholism on his ambition, which bothered him. As Gemma put a reassuring hand on Richard's shoulder, Catherine arrived. Gemma quickly left. Richard was surprised to see Catherine, who said she had to come as it was a family matter. He and Chris then reminisced about Sabi as a child. Privately, Richard explained Gemma's presence to Catherine, who took it as an admission of guilt. Soon after, Alex and Maggie delivered the bad news that Sabi had died on the table. Chris exploded in rage and yelled at Maggie. Catherine tried to defuse the situation and took Richard and his brother to go say goodbye to Sabi.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nRichard isolated himself from his loved ones. He attended Sabi's funeral without Catherine, Maggie, and Jackson as his family wasn't ready to see them. He arrived back in town the night before Meredith's trial with the medical board. At the hotel, he apologized to Jackson for not having reached out while in Boston and he snapped at Bailey, who commented on the amount of people that had taken time off work to come support Meredith. Richard followed the entire hearing and was called to the stand. The tampered-with Alzheimer's trial was brought up and Richard again took all the blame, frustrating Bailey. [[Patricia Murphy]] revealed in her testimony that Richard made a call to the NRMP to get Meredith a spot at Seattle Grace, displaying his habit of bending the rules in her favor. During the break, Bailey confronted him with his lying for Meredith, enabling her in her behavior rather than setting her straight. He said his taking the fall for her was his choice and that he only wrote a recommendation for her. Bailey pointed out he always went around the system for Meredith, regardless of the consequences, which Richard pointed out was her being jealous. He admitted to giving her special treatment due to his history with Ellis, which made him think of Meredith as family, which had made him willing to do the things he did. Bailey then vented her frustrations over the consequences she had faced because of their insurance fraud. She felt betrayed by someone she raised. He said he recognized that feeling from when she had torpedoed Meredith's character with her cold testimony. He thought Bailey would stick out her neck for Meredith like he had done. The trial then resumed and ended with Meredith getting to keep her license.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nGemma continued to look after Richard at work. Owen witnessed their close interaction but Richard assured him Gemma was just a friend. Gemma came by his office later where they talked about Sabi and Richard's fight with Catherine. Gemma brought up her husband's death, which made her start drinking. As they went to say a prayer together, [[Zander Perez]] briefly came in to complain about a procedure, believing Gemma to be Richard's wife, but Richard sent him away to go do his job. After Richard witnessed some flirty interactions between Owen and Daphne Lopez, a prospective ER doctor, he warned Owen that he was going down a slippery slope. When Owen said he was taken, Richard pointed out he hadn't yet proposed to Teddy and wondered what he was waiting for. That evening, as he was leaving with Gemma, Richard received a text from Catherine saying that she had left town for business. However, he didn't even know she had been in Seattle. He then told Gemma that Catherine was thinking that there was something going on between him and Gemma.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a car crashed into Joe's bar, Meredith called in Richard and Owen to help out at Grey Sloan as multiple residents had been injured. Bailey granted them privileges and Richard took on the case of [[Taryn Helm]]. Privately, Ben asked Richard to keep an eye out on Bailey as she wasn't giving herself time to process her recent miscarriage. Richard cautiously tried to let Bailey know that Ben had told him what was going on but she kept the conversation about work. However, during surgery, she couldn't bring herself to crack open Taryn's chest. Richard took over and they managed to save her life. Afterward, the two of them lingered in the OR and he told her all the residents had been saved. Finally having the time to let herself feel the grief, she broke down in Richard's arms. Richard later went to fetch Meredith and they dropped by Bailey's office with tissues and doughnuts to comfort her.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nUpon hearing Maggie had quit her job after Sabi's death and that Chris was suing her, he took a day off and went to see her at home. He wanted to take her out to go eat something but given her appearance, he thought it was better to eat in. As he was looking for food to make her breakfast, she told him she didn't deserve compassion from him. Since there was no food at the house, he said they would start with coffee while she insisted that she wanted to be alone. Over coffee, Richard told Maggie that she was Sabi's only shot. He told Maggie he hadn't been able to look at her because he sent her into that OR knowing Sabi was unlikely to survive. Maggie said it was all her fault as she had forgotten to ask about Sabi's clotting time, which she was used to being told by the OR staff at Grey Sloan. It had made her question her aptitude. She then begged Richard to leave. He left but soon returned with food. Maggie asked Richard to yell at her, knowing he had lost way more than her. Richard remained calm and shared with her the lesson that his mother had taught him: talk about your problems over pancakes. He made pancakes and as they were eating, he went over Sabi's case to find what he could have done better. Maggie insisted it was not his fault. Richard then told her she was just imperfect and human, which nobody had ever had to tell her before. Richard then advised her to let insurance settle with Chris to give him the sense that something came of Sabi's death. He stressed that Maggie was too skilled to quit and that Sabi wouldn't want that. Maggie wished she had gotten to know Sabi better so Richard invited her to ask him everything she wanted to know about her. That night at home, he found Catherine waiting for him. She had found out he hadn't shown up for work all day. He said he was trying to convince Maggie to go back to work but she questioned how that could  take all day. Richard pointed out things wouldn't work if she didn't trust him. She agreed and said she wasn't sure if things were working.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nRichard and Catherine talked it over and agreed to get a divorce. They planned on telling their children over dinner, which Richard found too much, but Catherine insisted. Maggie arrived first, figuring it was a dinner party for their anniversary. As soon as Jackson arrived, Richard wanted to get to the point but Catherine interrupted by handing out wine as she wanted to wait until after dinner. Unbeknownst to the hosts, Jackson had invited Vic, who brought Dean to set him up with Maggie. Catherine took Richard to the kitchen and said she didn't want to tell their children with all the extra people. They agreed to get through the night without letting Jackson and Maggie know. Over dinner, Catherine dissed Pac-North to hurt Richard. To defuse the tension, Dean asked Catherine and Richard how they met. Jackson and Maggie told their story, including their proposal. Jackson then made a toast to their perfect marriage. While preparing dessert, Catherine admitted she had forgotten about the proposal story and it had made her realize that they always managed to find a way through the bad times. She asked him not to give up yet. He asked her to apologize first for not showing him loyalty and turning her back on him when he had to rebuild his entire life. She couldn't bring herself to truly apologize, causing Richard to declare that it was too late for their marriage to be saved.\n\nOver dessert, Richard started texting. Catherine openly accused him of cheating on her with Gemma. Richard revealed he had actually been in touch with Alex to approve an offer to hire Maggie at Pac-North. Jackson made a snide comment. Having had enough with all the tension, Catherine finally blurted out that she and Richard were getting a divorce. Richard apologized to the children for them having to find out this way. He went out to get some air, where Maggie came to sit with him. He told her it was truly over with Catherine. She comforted him and accepted the job offer. Once the guests were gone, he went inside to pack for a hotel but Catherine already called her driver. He told Catherine that Maggie had accepted his offer, which only infuriated Catherine more. She said that she was embarrassed for him throwing his career away and now dragging Maggie down with him. He knew that she hated how Maggie would put their hospital on the map and it would be out of Catherine's control. As he stressed that he was now free to do as he pleased, she pulled out his phone and made a call to her finance guy to look into buying Pac-North. She casually said she could shut it down. She told him she wasn't sorry about a damn thing and headed out the door.<ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref>\n\nOn Monday, Richard told Owen that Catherine had bought the hospital after a fight. She made them go over to Grey Sloan and interview with Tom, who would decide if they would be hired at Grey Sloan. Tom called in Richard first and told him his job was safe, as Catherine requested. Richard was angry about Catherine playing him like a piece of chess and turned the offer down. Richard left to go to a meeting but couldn't bring himself to go the empty house afterward. Jackson found Richard on a bench outside the hospital in the evening. Jackson thought it would all blow over soon but Richard wasn't too sure about that. Jackson then gathered Bailey, Meredith, and Owen and the five of them met with Tom. They told him they were prepared to quit en masse, which would piss Catherine off, unless he agreed to their terms. Part of the deal was that Richard would be re-hired. Tom was forced to agree to their ultimatum.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nTo distract Richard from his marriage falling apart, Bailey had him train the new residents who had been hired from Pac-North. She also invited him to dinner but he didn't appreciate her fussing over him. All day, Richard was distracted while the residents practiced in the skills lab. After Bailey heard that Richard had dismissed the residents before  P.M., she found him sitting outside. He told her he didn't want her checking up on him. He added that having those subpar residents at Grey Sloan felt like a punishment, like Catherine had won. Bailey expressed worry after he told her he was bone tired, cautiously suggesting he was suffering from depression. He told her he would be okay and left.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a skills lab, a resident named Tess Desmond asked Richard why he was still practicing despite his immense amount of experience. He replied that practice was the key to experience. After Tess said she didn't understand why the other residents weren't taking their job more seriously after everything they had been through to get there, Richard invited her to practice her laparoscopic skills with him. After Tess calmly reassured a patient during rounds, Richard invited her to scrub in with him. As they were scrubbing in, she listed all the steps to the procedure and Richard said he would allow her to perform the procedure, much to her astonishment. However, before she made the first cut, Levi came barging in and announced that Tess was actually his patient, [[Tess Anderson]]. She was taken back to her room, where she explained that she had had to let go of her dream of becoming a surgeon after going through four types of cancer in eight years drained her college funds. She just wanted to live her dream for one day. Richard then performed the procedure with Taryn after all. He visited Tess afterward and said his dream of becoming a surgeon was harder than it was for others, too, but he stuck with it. He then revealed he had developed a tremor in his hands, preventing him from operating again, as would any treatment for it. In an attempt to inspire her not to give up on chasing the most beautiful job in the world, he gave her his stethoscope, saying he wouldn't need it anymore.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOne morning, Richard received a letter from Alex, which he took with him to an AA meeting. He quickly read it and angrily threw it away. During the meeting, he spoke about the rush of being a surgeon and training young minds. He said a student he wouldn't have put money on at first stepped up and became a stellar surgeon and a fine teacher. Said student informed him through a letter that he would abandoned his entire life to be a father to the two children he apparently had with his ex-wife, whom he now loved again. Richard wanted to yell at him for making that mistake but having fallen in love with two women at the same time before and having missed his own child growing up, he knew Alex had to follow his heart and gut. Richard admitted he mostly felt robbed of the chance to say goodbye, even more so after they had begun to turn Pac-North around. He concluded that lately, all his loved ones were disappearing and he couldn't find a way to make it stop. As he finished his talk, his hand was shaking again.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Richard handed off his entire service, only teaching skills lab anymore. Soon after, Richard found movers moving his furniture from Pac-North into his office at Grey Sloan. He demanded they take the furniture back, much to Bailey's surprise. Richard left to teach a skills lab. Afterward, Bailey took him back to his office and showed him she arranged for his old furniture from before his firing to be moved into place. However, he got angry again for her assuming that that is what he wanted. In a hissy fit, he declined her offer to call building services and started throwing things onto the floor. At the end of the day, Bailey found Richard sitting in his empty office and brought up his handing off his service. He admitted the smallest thing set him off these days and apologized for his outburst. He told her he was stepping back from surgery, which is why he didn't want to use this office anymore. It reminded him of another time, another him, and it cluttered his mind. He held his hand to stop it from shaking while he said he wanted to look ahead. Bailey said the hospital needed him. He simply said he wanted to step away while at the top of his game.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn [[Pro Bono Surgery Day|pro bono surgery day]], Maggie let Richard know that she had settled with [[Chris Webber|Chris]] like Richard had advised her to. Richard then shared that Catherine had sent over divorce papers. She let him keep his own house. Meredith then came up and tried to talk him into joining the pro bono surgical team but he turned her down. Jackson later ran into him and asked about his day. Richard just said he had nothing and walked off. At night, Jackson invited Richard to the game that night to show him that he wasn't picking sides in the divorce. Richard happily accepted.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nRichard traveled to Los Angeles to present his PathPen at the LA Surgical Innovation Conference. He called Maggie \"Meredith\" upon meeting her in the lobby but blamed it on the flight. He had rewritten his talk  times and was eager to share his Pen with the world. As he was working on his speech by himself in his room, he was surprised when Catherine showed up at his door with an apology for her behavior. He then admitted Gemma had kissed him. They then laughed about their expensive fight and lied down on the bed. The next morning, he ordered breakfast for her. He was vigorously working on his speech by the time she woke up, rambling on about a luminous insight into cancer. He kept going on as she encouraged him. Unaware that he had been talking to a hallucination the entire time, he declared he was finished and recited his talk to her, working in a joke per her advice. Later that day, he took the stage with many of his colleagues watching the livestream from home. After a charming introduction, he announced that he wasn't going to talk about his Pen and declared that with his brilliant wife's help, he had found a way to cure cancer, alarming his loved ones, including Catherine back in Seattle, who assumed he was drunk. He then started his chaotic, nonsensical talk about cells and cancer and went through slides of hand-drawn pictures of organs and atomic explosions, stating that cells need apologies. A slide showed Catherine's name written in a heart. As he went on, Teddy called for help while Maggie and Cormac got on the stage and told him that he wasn't feeling well. Not recognizing her, he tried to keep going and got a little aggressive. Maggie and Cormac escorted him off the stage and got him on a gurney. As he was taken away, he suddenly recognized Maggie again and asked her what was happening, while it dawned on him he had been hallucinating the entire night.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine boarded her private plane to Los Angeles to go pick up Richard and Maggie. While flying back to Seattle, Maggie found memes online mocking Richard. Catherine's publicist got to work trying to minimize the damage. While the attendings gathered in a war room to find the diagnosis, Richard got settled in a room, again not realizing something was wrong. Catherine played along with her being at the conference and claimed he got sick after his presentation, which is why they were running the test. While they performed a PET scan, Richard cited all steps of a Whipple procedure to prove that he wasn't losing his mind. The scan showed no signs of Alzheimer's or Lewy Body dementia. Andrew paid Richard a visit in his room, pretending it was a social visit, even though he was in contact with [[Lauren Riley]]. Maggie and Meredith later performed some cognitive testing, which he failed miserably. They brushed it off as his being tired to keep him calm. Later, Richard disappeared from his room. His loved ones spread out to find him. Meredith found him in a dark OR about to cut himself open for an ex-lap, stating he was the only one who could fix this. Meredith cautiously approached and assured him that she could fix him, too, as he was the one who had taught her everything she knows. She wanted her children to grow up and know him. She wasn't ready to let him go yet, and neither were other people. He handed over the scalpel. He called her Ellis and said something was wrong with him. She guided him back to his room. He thought he was at Seattle Grace and asked for his interns so they could start rounding. He also said Adele would kill him if he was late for dinner again. Unable to bear watching his decline, Catherine left the room while Meredith and Maggie got Richard comfortable.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine continued to watch over him even though he did not recognize her, his cognitive function rapidly declining even further to the point of him being minimally responsive. After a few weeks, Catherine wanted to take Richard home despite his doctors' protest. As they tried to get him in a wheelchair, which angered him, he revealed he had numb extremities. The EMG showed impaired nerve function, which wasn't consistent with the tentative diagnosis of dementia. They then went to do a nerve biopsy but Andrew interrupted the procedure, thinking he had found he diagnosis: cobalt poisoning from his hip replacement three years ago. As cobalt wasn't included in the standard heavy metal panel, Meredith drew another blood sample, which confirmed the diagnosis. Link operated and replaced the hip, removing the toxic sludge from his body. Richard woke up in the ICU after a while with Maggie by his side. He recognized her and answered some questions correctly. His tremor was also gone. Catherine then came in and said she was having nurses bring her a bed so she could spend the night. However, he didn't want her there as he perfectly remembered her not standing by him as he got fired and her buying his hospital just to spite him. He ordered her to get out.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nRichard is a determined teacher and boss who cares a lot for his personnel and the hospital itself.\n\nHis private life is devoted to his professional one. Without his job, he doesn't have a real reason to live, especially after his wife,\ua[[Adele Webber]], died. He was a loving husband towards her, despite the fact that he cheated on her and put his duties in the hospital above everything.\n\nHe has always cared for\ua[[Meredith Grey]]\uaas if he was her father. He decided to mentor her personally to make sure she became a great general surgeon.\ua\n\n\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\n[[File:xEllisRichardFlashback.jpg|thumb|left|px|Richard leaves Ellis.]]Richard met [[Ellis Grey]] when [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] was three. During their residency at Seattle Grace, he had an affair with her, although both were married. Although Ellis left her husband, Richard could not bring himself to leave his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]]. He would learn decades later, however, that Adele had known about the affair all along and stayed with him anyway. He later confessed that he ended the affair because he believed that Ellis deserved better and that he had too much baggage.\n\nWhen Dr. [[Maggie Pierce]] began to work at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], she told Richard that she was adopted and [[Ellis Grey]] was her birth mom, leaving Richard to suspect that he is her biological father.\n\n[[Adele Webber]]\nRichard proposed to Adele on New Year's and got married the Valentine's Day after. They got married when Adele was .\n\nAdele asked him to retire, forcing him to choose between his career or their marriage. He tried to skirt around it, but Adele, tired of waiting, made her choice\uaand left him. He moved out and was sleeping in his office for a short time, but later had a room at the same hotel as [[Callie Torres|Callie]]. After learning of Ellis's illness, Richard had been visiting her regularly, but upon deciding to attempt a reconciliation with Adele realized that he could no longer continue his emotional affair with Ellis. He attempted\uato patch things up with his wife but was stunned to find out that she had\uaapparently moved on to someone else.\n\nAdele was admitted to the hospital and was discovered, first by Addison and later by Richard, to be pregnant (at  years old). Though he believed the father to be the man Adele insinuated to be seeing months earlier, Richard stayed by Adele's side as she was treated, though complications later arose and she lost the baby. Adele later admitted to Richard that the baby, which was a boy, was actually his. After this tragedy, Richard and Adele decided to give their marriage another try.\n\nRichard and Adele declared that his work was the reason that their marriage had failed. He started living on Derek's property in his own trailer and began to repair his life as a divorc\ue.\n\nAfter months living apart, Richard decided to move back home. He admitted to Adele that he made a mistake  years ago but he's a good man, and he doesn't treat her as she deserves, putting his foot down. Adele commented, \"It's about time\" and allowed Richard to return home.<ref>[[Freedom, Part ]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Adele moves into Roseridge.|xpx]]\n\nAfter Adele was placed in [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]] after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and finding a new love, [[Allan]], Richard began to date [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]].\n\nAdele later passed away of a heart attack on the day of [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey's]] wedding.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\n[[Catherine Fox]]\nRichard and Catherine maintained a\uaflirtatious relationship throughout her first two visits to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital|Seattle Grace Mercy West]]. He almost accompanied her to a medical ball, but he realized he needed to be with his\ua[[Adele Webber|wife]] in her time of need. By the time of the medical boards, Adele's condition had\uadeteriorated to the point she did not recognize Richard anymore and had begun \"dating\" another man. This was when Catherine and Richard began their sexual relationship. When Adele died, Richard pushed away Catherine and her efforts at a relationship. They have since reconciled and see each other on an irregular basis, but are serious. Richard was planning on proposing to Catherine, but a huge argument about Cristina losing the Harper Avery Award changed his mind. After some time apart, Richard professed his feelings for Catherine and subsequently, they reconciled. Richard and Catherine later showed differing views on marriage just as he was about to propose to her again. Some time later, Catherine proposed to Richard in front of the whole hospital, to which he agreed.\n\nThey faced difficulties in their marriage after Richard was fired, as he said that she had just sat there and let him be fired. He began to work at Pac-North, which upset Catherine. They eventually decided to separate, and at a dinner where they were supposed to break the news to Jackson and Maggie, they had another argument. This ended in Catherine purchasing Pac-North. Richard first refused to be hired back to Grey Sloan because of what happened with Catherine, but he eventually came back.\ua\n\nDuring his cobalt poisoning, Catherine stayed by his side, as he didn't remember what she had done. After Richard was cured, he demanded that she leave.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nRichard attended both of Bailey's weddings. In , Miranda became an intern at\ua[[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Richard discovered her talent when she correctly diagnosed a patient after  months of unnecessary surgeries.\ua\n\nWhen he was a drunk, she was the only one that managed to make him admit it and sign the papers to go into rehab instead of signing the papers for early retirement.\n\nHe was the one who recommended\uathat she be the new board member after Cristina's departure, and he also recommended her to be chief when [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] stepped down. \n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nRichard and Derek were good friends. They first met during Derek's residency when Richard was one of his teachers. When Richard separated from [[Adele Webber|his wife]], Derek allowed Richard to park his trailer on his land and live there.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[File:RichardandMeredithForgiveEachOther.jpg|thumb|left|Richard and Meredith forgiving each other|xpx]]Richard and Meredith share a father-daughter-esque relationship. He met her during his residency when Meredith was a little girl. In the recent past, after Meredith started her surgical residency, the relationship between the two of them was a rocky one. For quite some time, Meredith couldn't forgive Richard that he had forced her parents apart and acted unprofessionally and disrespectfully towards him. Also, Richard couldn't forgive himself for not standing up for her and never doing anything about the fact that Ellis was neglecting her. Also, he couldn't detach the feelings he had for Meredith's mother,\ua[[Ellis Grey]], from the feelings he had for her. After an intervention by [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], they forgave each other.\n\nAfter a gunman, by the name of [[Gary Clark]] entered the hospital and started shooting people, Meredith offered herself to him, stating that she was the closest thing to a daughter Richard had.\n\nAfter the shooting, they maintained a good relationship until his accident during [[Super Storm|the super storm]]. In the aftermath of this accident, Meredith learned that she was Richard's healthcare proxy and that his life depended on her decisions. Meredith made the decision to have them operate and he woke up from his coma. After waking up, Richard told Meredith that he had only made her his medical proxy because he thought she had the guts to let him die. This revelation estranged them for a while, but subsequently, Richard apologized and they both returned to a close relationship.\n\n\nHe was the [[Chief of Surgery]] at Seattle Grace and was formerly a mentor to [[Derek Shepherd]] and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] during their residency.\n\nThere are continuity errors regarding where exactly Richard built his career; at one point, he states that with the exception of his fellowship, he spent his entire career at Seattle Grace. However, it is also established that he both taught and befriended Addison and Derek, presumably in New York (the majority of references within the show, as well as additional sources, indicate that a good portion of Richard's career was spent in Manhattan, rather than Seattle). He also has a diploma from Northwestern University. \n\nA board member regards Richard as the best surgeon in the hospital and is demonstrated on the occasion in the robotics lab where he takes the course as a \"refresher\", and he pits himself against [[Cristina Yang]], losing in the first few tasks. In the last task, performing a minor operation, Richard manages to complete the surgery with his eyes closed, while Cristina struggles to get ahead. When asked how he managed to do so, he claims muscle memory - he is so used to these procedures knows how to perform the surgery with his eyes closed.\n\nRichard had planned to retire and recommended [[Preston Burke]] as his successor, but after the secret of Burke's tremor and cover-up came out, that plan was put to a stand-still. Nevertheless, he has told the hospital board of his retirement and has yet to name his successor; Derek, Preston, Addison, and Mark all eagerly clamoring for the post. Richard eventually chose Derek, but Derek tells him that Richard should remain chief.\n\nIn an attempt to move back home, Richard begins to delegate some of his work to other staff with responsibilities, such as the [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]], at the time being [[Callie Torres]], but as she was slightly unaware of what to do exactly, [[Miranda Bailey]] eventually replaces her, reducing Richard's burden. To assist with this further, he enlists\ua [[George O'Malley]] to become the chief's intern to assist with some of his day to day duties, such as passing messages, phone calls, charting, pre-op and post-op patients amongst other things, until George finally had enough after learning he failed his intern exam by  point.\n\nAfter the death of O'Malley and throughout the merger with Mercy West, Richard comes under a massive amount of stress. He makes a mistake on a patient that brings to the attention of Bailey that something is wrong. Eventually, he takes Meredith under his tutelage where she finally figures out that he had started to drink again. Meredith eventually tells Derek and Derek brings it to the attention of the board who force Richard to resign as chief and his responsibilities as a doctor; Derek takes over his position as chief of surgery.\n\nAfter a numerous number of days sober, Richard finally returns to being a [[General Surgery|general surgery]] [[Attending|attending]] under Shepherd. He is the doctor that was on the case of [[Gary Clark]]'s wife and did her surgery. She did not recover however and died leaving Clark with a vendetta against him. Clark later returns and begins to shoot people, mainly surgeons, in the hospital. Webber was not present at the time but once he hears what is going on he finds a way into the hospital and confronts Clark, who ultimately commits suicide.\n\nDerek resigns as chief surgeon, leaving Richard as interim chief until the board agrees to let him come back full-time as the chief of surgery. After a day of recalling his old procedures with [[Ellis Grey]], he began going through her journals again. When he found the trick he was looking for, Richard was encouraged to try to expand her findings on islet cell transplantation, which was stopped because of her Alzheimer's. He initiated a clinical trial to cure type  diabetes through a device that contains insulin-producing islet cells. He even tried to get Meredith to participate, which she ultimately turned down because she was dedicated to Derek's Alzheimer's trial.\n\nBefore he could get the approval or a waiver from the FDA, Richard tried the device and procedure on Clara Greene, who was in a hypoglycemic coma. Eventually, it was approved. Richard, with [[Jackson Avery]] as his assistant, began trying out the \"artificial pancreas\" on humans, as well as mice.\n\nRichard took the fall for Meredith's tampering of a clinical trial for Alzheimer's which could help Adele. He resigned as Chief and helped [[Owen Hunt]] obtain the job as his successor. He has since been a senior general surgery attending. Richard passed the clinical trial onto Dr. Bailey.\n\nRichard invested money to buy\ua[[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], which was later renamed\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. As Richard is a part-owner of [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], he has a seat on the board as a member.\ua\n\nAfter he had recovered from his accident, [[Owen Hunt]] made him [[Resident#Program Director|director of the residency program]].\n\nAfter Owen quit, Richard was named interim chief of surgery until they could replace him.\n\nBecause he didn't want to be the Chief anymore, he recommended Miranda Bailey for the job. She was judged up against a candidate chosen by Catherine Avery, [[Tracy McConnell]], and was ultimately named Chief of Surgery.\n\nAfter reviewing the residency records and finding several questionable calls, Catherine Avery made Bailey hire a new Director of the residency program, Dr. Eliza Minnick. This upset Richard, who believed Bailey had betrayed him. Eventually, he started to work alongside Minnick with the residents. This ended when after the hospital fire, Bailey fired Minnick, reinstating Richard in his function.\n\nBailey fired him upon discovering the role he played in covering up Meredith's insurance fraud. He initially got a job working for the health app Pronto Health Pro, but quit soon. He interviewed for the Chief of Surgery job at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]], the last ranked hospital of Seattle since its new investors were looking for someone with vision and experience to turn the place around. However, he wasn't hired because of his approaching retirement. He then made Alex interview and when he got the job, made him hire him as an attending general surgeon there.\n\n\n*He is a recovering alcoholic.\n*When he drinks, he drinks vodka.\n*He has driven several Mercedes Benz E-Class Models through the years\n*His favorite cake is red velvet with cream cheese icing.<ref>[[Hope for the Hopeless]], x</ref>\n*He claims to be strong at history and geography trivia.\n*In , Webber won a plaque for \"best doctors in America\".\n*His email address is [[rwebber@seattlegrace.com]].\n*He taught a painful lesson to Addison about getting to close to her patients by giving her a patient who would eventually die.

While in the skills lab, she struck up a conversation with Richard Webber, who allowed her to practice her skills under his supervision. She then accompanied him and the residents on rounds, where she impressed [[Ava Gutierrez]] by telling her the shelters were open  hours a day and were accepting any animals people brought in to protect them from the cold. Richard decided to let Tess scrub in on Ava's surgery, thinking she was a resident. Just as she prepared to cut, Levi came in and recognized her as his patient.

She was the youngest of five siblings, but was always the mother when they played.\n\nWhen she grew up, she married Jonathan and they immediately tried to have children. She had her first miscarriage six months into their marriage and had one per year until they finally got to the second trimester. Then she had a placental abruption and had to have an emergency hysterectomy and the fetus did not survive. Jonathan was then diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma and died, but before he died, he froze his sperm, giving Tovah the hope that she'd eventually bring his child into the world and realize her dream of being a mother.\n\nOver two years later, Tovah was prepared to have a uterine transplant to aid her journey to motherhood. Since she had family in Seattle to help her during her recovery, Addison asked to do her surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial. As Addison operated, the HVAC system at the hospital went out, forcing her to call in Meredith to rush the surgery. After the placed the graft, there was no blood flow, forcing them to detach it to dislodge a clot. Despite this complication, the surgery was a success and Tovah was stable after her surgery. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her transplant surgery, Tovah began having seizures. Addison administered lorazepam and phenobarbital to treat the seizures with no effect. In order to preserve brain function, Addison put her into an induced coma in order to consult with a neurosurgeon for further treatment options. After her CT and labs were evaluated, Amelia ordered an MRI, an EEG, and additional panel-testing to determine her electrolyte and immunosuppressant levels. Because the testing revealed no neurological causes for the seizures, Amelia recommended an increase of anticonvulsants and switching immunosuppressants to combat the likely cause of neurotoxicity from the anti-rejection medication due to the uterine transplant. Addison agreed, and the new treatment plan proved successful. She woke up with the uterine transplant intact and still qualifying for Addison's trial. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nSeveral months later, Tovah was pregnant in her transplanted uterus. The pregnancy was her final embryo made from her husband's sperm. When she was eleven weeks, she reported abdominal pain, so Addison came to Seattle to check on her. Addison found that she had restricted blood flow to both sides of the uterus. An MR angio showed the right side was completely clotted off while the left side was clotted, but salvageable, so they took her into surgery to clear the blockage and try to save the graft and the pregnancy. In surgery, they discovered there was no blood flow to the left side. Addison prepared to remove the graft and pregnancy, but Meredith suggested a vascular revision to restore blood flow. It worked, but by that point, there was not fetal heartbeat. Addison did a D&C. When Addison told Tovah what had happened, she also told her the graft was still viable and she could try again, just not with her husband's sperm. Levi, seeing her grief, offered to recite the mourner's Kaddish with her. She cried as they did so. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to Jonathan until his death.

He agreed to wait for a while, but after she was delayed several more times, he refused to stay. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nOne day, while Tuck was home with Tucker, a bookshelf fell on him. He was rushed to the ER and then into surgery to repair the damage. The surgery was successful, but he still wasn't breathing on his own. In an attempt to help, they had a faith healer in the hospital, [[Elizabeth Archer]], come see him. After she had them do a healing ritual, Tuck started breathing on his own again. Later that night, Tucker went back to the house to get a few things and got himself a hotel room. ''(\"[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]\")''\n\n\nAfter she told him she wanted to start a [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship]], Tucker gave her an ultimatum: him or the job. She left him because a marriage that resorts to ultimatums is not a marriage, but also turned down the fellowship because she was going to be a single mom. ''(\"[[Now or Never]]\")'' By Christmas Eve of Bailey's first year as an attending, his parents-in-law found out they were in the process of a divorce. His [[William Bailey|father-in-law]] disapproved. By New Year's Day, the couple had divorced. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nMiranda Bailey is Tucker's first wife.

''(\"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\")''  \n\nThey'd been married for ten years when Bailey became pregnant with their son. ''(\"[[Bring the Pain]]\")''\n\nHowever, in his opinion, Miranda never spent enough time at home. She even left their ten year anniversary dinner for work. She didn't trick or treat with her son, and her son even got badly injured looking for his mother. Miranda and Tucker constantly bickered, so they started talking about divorce and he began dating other women and moved out, leaving Miranda sleeping alone for the first time in twelve years.\n\nThey began to attend marriage counseling. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nWhen Miranda told him she was trying to get a fellowship in pediatric surgery, he gave her an ultimatum, him or her job. Miranda decided to stay with general surgery, but decided to leave Tucker anyway because partners shouldn't give ultimatums. ''(\"[[Now or Never]]\")'' \n\n\nHe gave up his job to be a stay at home dad for his son, Tuck.
