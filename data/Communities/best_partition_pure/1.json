She wanted to test how long it would take before someone took a look at her, and when April finally approached her, she told her she'd been  minutes in the ER bed. ''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:MeetingRichard.png|thumb|px|Alana meeting Richard again.]]\nAfter she met up with Owen, he gave her a tour around the hospital. She met Derek, and told him she'd watch his surgery the next day. While informing Owen on the waiting time in the ER, they ran into Richard Webber. Alana was one his students. At first, Richard thought she came to the hospital looking to join the staff.\ua\n\nThey also ran into Arizona, who was trying to relax in one of the lounges. While entering the lounge, Alana told Owen she'd be looking at everything in the hospital. Alex informed her on a pediatric case, and she shared a conversation with him and Arizona. She told she'd watch her surgery the next day.\n\n[[File:ORObserving.png|thumb|left|px|Alana watches Alex stabbing Arizona in her prosthetic foot.]]The next day, she was trying to fit in as many surgeries as possible in her schedule. Jo Wilson deliberately changed the hour of Derek's surgery on the OR board, so Cahill wouldn't be there.\n\nDuring Arizona's surgery, Alana talked to Owen about the Africa program. When Arizona started to suffer from phantom limb, Dr. Cahill questioned if Arizona even should be allowed in that OR. Too busy to help Arizona, Owen revealed that Derek's surgery had started hours ago, making her leave the gallery to go observe Derek. However, he threw her out of his OR and she walked back in right at the time Owen ordered Alex to stab Arizona's prosthetic with a scalpel. Alana then figured out why Arizona had been acting so strange the past days. ''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\")''\n\n\nDuring a staff meeting, Alana told the doctors she was impressed by what she had seen the past three days. She especially praised the Africa program, saying it was good publicity for the hospital and that she didn't feel like cutting it. However, she did say she would have to make cuts. She surprisingly proposed to close the ER, claiming it was hemorrhaging resources.\ua''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\"\u)''\n\nAlana had cameras placed all over the CCU. On the other side of the cameras is a remote physician., who is there to help reduce mistakes, improve patient care and maximize physician hours. She also made sure that the OR's were arranged with maximum efficiency, specifically for OR turnovers.\uaAlana also demanded that the doctors' average time between surgeries,  minutes, would be cut in half.\n\nShe also brought in a doctor to teach the general surgeons a new technique for a hernia repair, claiming it was needed to standardize OR procedures.[[File:ClosedER.png|thumb|px|Owen closes the ER.]]\n\nShe wanted to replace the ER, which was open for one more day, with something she had yet to think about. She sent workmen to measure it up, but Owen sent them off because he didn't want them to be there while the ER was still open.\n\nTrying to save the ER, April and Derek created a whole plan to make budget cuts in every department. When they proudly presented it to Cahill, she said that the hospital couldn't be saved by making budgets cuts, but that it had to be bought. She revealed that she had to make the hospital presentable, and that the ER had to go.\ua''(\"[[Bad Blood]]\")''\n\n\nAlana Cahill managed to find a buyer for the hospital, a group of businessmen named Pegasus. After modernizing the hospital with tablets, she gave them a tour around the hospital, exactly at the time when April brought in a trauma patient. In the empty ER, which was being turned into a hernia clinic, April and several other doctors gave the patient first aid care.[[File:BloodGround.png|thumb|px|Alana notices blood on the ground in the ER.]]\n\nWhen Cahill and a few members of Pegasus were about to visit the ER, Derek managed to distract them long enough so the patient could be moved to an OR. While talking to the Pegasus members about the hernia clinic, Cahill noticed some blood on the floor. It didn't take her long to figure out that someone brought in a trauma patient. She left the Pegasus members with Derek, ordering him to continue the tour.\uaShe found out that April, Meredith and Cristina were operating on the trauma patient. However, Meredith \"accidentally\" deleted the patient's file on the new tablets.\n\n[[File:DerekSpeech.png|thumb|left|px|Alana telling Derek that Pegasus is the only option left for the hospital.]]Cahill then decided to interrogate every doctor involved, starting with the interns. Alex and Jackson then confessed, claiming it was the right thing to do. Owen let them go unpunished, much to Alana's surprise. She paged Shepherd, telling him she knew he helped the other doctors because it was his code that accessed the medication case on the fifth floor. Cahill then reveals that if the kid had died, it would've cost the hospital a lot of money and it would have made Pegasus back out. She revealed Pegasus to be the only option left, and said that if the staff continued to undermine her, the hospital wouldn't stay open.\ua\n\nDuring all this, Callie and Richard visited another hospital that was owned by Pegasus. What they saw there didn't please them, and what the doctors there told them didn't sound good at all. Callie then proposed to the doctors who were involved in the plane crash to buy the hospital themselves.\ua''(\"[[The Face of Change]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:DerekPoster.png|thumb|px|The promo poster with Derek on it.]]\nLike in the other hospitals Pegasus owned, she chose a doctor to promote the hospital. Derek got appointed as face of the hospital, making brochures and giant posters with his face on them. Derek disliked them, but she refused to have them taken down because they served as promotional material for the hospital. The nurses didn't like all the changes, and they all threatened to quit. Cahill needed Owen to talk them out of it. He was successful in doing so.\n\nWhile Alana and Owen were dealing with the nurses, the last thing that had to be dealt with before the hospital could be sold, the group of doctors who were in the plane crash and Callie all come to the conclusion that they should buy the hospital themselves, as Pegasus wouldn't do any good to the hospital.[[File:YelledAt.png|thumb|left|px|Alana gets yelled at by a hospital board member because Pegasus withdrew the offer.]] However, Pegasus moved up the sale to that night, leaving them with too little time to come up with a decent plan. Therefore, they saw only one option left to postpone the sale. During the meeting, Derek, Meredith, Callie, Arizona and Cristina resigned, completely changing the value of the hospital and making Pegasus back out.\n\nAlana was left startled and yelled at by one of the board members and Owen. She stammered she couldn't salvage the sale because there was no way she could replace these doctors and that she couldn't reposition or find new buyers. Owen told her she had to save the sale.\ua''(\"[[Hard Bargain]]\")''\n\nShe did manage to get Pegasus back in, but their counteroffer was to buy the hospital for parts, liquidating its assets and laying off its staff. Alana informed the hospital board, having them pull together an emergency meeting to discuss it. However, like\ua[[Roberta Thompson]]\uatold Alana, the hospital needed an offer, and this was the only one, leaving them with no other choice.\ua[[File:AnotherBuyer.png|thumb|px|Owen tells Alana and the board that the group of doctors wants to buy the hospital.]]\n\nCristina told Owen about their plan to buy the hospital. During the emergency meeting, he walked in and told the board and Alana about the doctors' plan, convincing the hospital board to wait another day. Cahill tried to persuade the board not to wait, because then Pegasus would lose interest for good. However, the board listened to Owen and decided to let the doctors buy the hospital.\n\nWhen Julian Crest refused to invest in the hospital, the doctors' plan had failed and they couldn't buy the hospital. With no offer from Pegasus left, there was no hope for the hospital anymore. Everyone got ready for the hospital to close its doors. Alana thereby didn't manage to save the hospital, but\ua[[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]]\uadid by having the\ua[[Harper Avery]]\uafoundation invest in the hospital.\ua''(\"[[This is Why We Fight]]\")''\n\n\nDr. Cahill was a student of Richard Webber, and he described her as a great student and a gifted surgeon.\n\nHowever, during a surgery, Alana choked. She said that was the reason she left the OR to become a physician advisor. She told Owen she saved a dozen of hospitals before she came to Seattle.\n\nAt the end of her third day in the hospital, Richard said she was judging harshly, but Alana claimed that was part of her job. She also said that during her intern year, Richard said to her that medicine was constantly changing and that she had to be part of the change or get out. She then said that she was making changes, and that he should be proud of her.\n\nAlana said to Owen she was very good at her job. She proved this by making Pegasus interested again in buying the hospital, after they previously backed out because Derek, Meredith, Callie, Arizona, and Cristina all resigned.\n\n\n*She hums to herself while operating.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[Walking on a Dream]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[Bad Blood]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[The Face of Change]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[Hard Bargain]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[This is Why We Fight]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n:'''Alana:'''\uaWell, I'll see you in the OR tomorrow.\n:'''[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]:'''\uaTypically, you need to be invited.\n:'''Alana:'''\uaIf things were running typically, I wouldn't be here, now would I?\n\n\n{{Alana Cahill Appearances}}\n[[de:Alana Cahill]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cahill, Alana}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

When Bonnie crashed, Meredith yelled to the other doctors (including Derek Shepherd) \"we can't just abandon her\", referring not only to Bonnie's situation but also to her personal situation, feeling abandoned by Derek. Bonnie appears in the limbo-like scene when Meredith is dead in Season  to remind her to fight for her own life--Meredith was the only one who fought for Bonnie's life, and it wasn't enough.

Stephanie and Jackson ran some tests and took scans, revealing that the muscles in esophagus were working against each other instead of working together. The esophagus wall formed a sack, where Dalton's food was being kept, and that caused his bad breath. Jackson explained a minimally invasive surgical procedure to solve the problem. He explained the risks of the procedure, a small one being damage to the vocal cord nerves, meaning he wouldn't be able to speak anymore. After hearing this, Dalton blurted out that his wife had a very cute butt because he didn't want anything to be left unsaid in case he'll end up unable to speak ever again after surgery.

Her purple dress did make her look fat, and he confessed he lied when he said it was pretty. He wanted his last words to be honest. He then started singing \"It Had to Be You\", which is their song. The wife jokingly asked Jackson to cut the vocal cords when they arrived at the doors Karen wasn't allowed to pass. Dalton then asked her to come closer and whispered something into her ear. Karen then kissed him and he was taken to the OR.\n\nIn the OR, Jackson tried to get to Dalton's esophagus laparoscopically, but when that didn't work he decided to go in surgically through the neck. The nurses prepared for that procedure while Jackson and Stephanie started thinking out loud about what Dalton whispered into his wife's ear, deciding it was most likely that he loved her.\ua[[BokHee]]\uathen informed them the patient was ready, and Jackson started cutting into Dalton's neck.\n\n\nAfter the surgery, Jackson informed Karen that everything went fine, even though they had to go in surgically. Dalton would have a fresh breath again from now on. Stephanie noticed how Dalton was waking up, and his wife greeted him. Suddenly, Dalton had a stroke, and while Jackson examined Dalton's pupils, Stephanie paged Derek Shepherd.\n\nDerek later explained to Karen that Dalton had had a massive stroke that dislodged a blood clot in the carotid artery during surgery. The post-operative stroke is a rare outcome for any surgery, and he assured her they'd persue any avenue to rehabilitation even though he was afraid they wouldn't be able to fix it. Jackson answered Karen's questions, telling her that Dalton is awake even though he can't speak or move. Jackson assured her they'd do anything they can and apologized. Karen asked if he could hear her, which Jackson told her wasn't certain, and she then lovingly started singing their song, just like he did before the surgery.\n\n\n\n[[Karen Marks]]\nDalton has been married to Karen for quite some time.

When it was time to play, Joe needed a partner after his flaked on him, and Debbie volunteered to be his partner. Her dart skills brought her and Joe up to semifinals, where they lost. Joe congratulated Debbie on her dart skills and she thanked him for taking her mind off work. While munching on peanuts, they began to gossip about the people they both knew. Debbie then had the revelation that they shared a connection to almost every person at Seattle Grace; Debbie saw them at work, and Joe saw them after work. Debbie said that it was like \"comparing notes\". They have been best friends ever since. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n[[Elizabeth Fallon]]\nShe was good friends with Elizabeth while she worked at the hospital. When she died, Debbie was in the room and she said it was a strangely serene moment. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n[[Yvonne]]\nYvonne and Debbie hit it off while [[Mary]] was being treated. Debbie even managed to get them some jello cups, despite the cafeteria being closed. When Yvonne died due to internal bleeding, Debbie said that it hit her hard since she looked fine but was more damaged then most of the patients in the room. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nAfter Cristina stole a patient from the psych ward and dismissed Debbie rudely after asking for paperwork on the patient, she paged her constantly for rectal exams and other disgusting cases. At the end of the day, Cristina went to Bailey, assuming that it was her, and asked why she was paged for all those cases, but Bailey said that she had no idea what she was talking about. Debbie then says to Cristina that if she had shown a little respect, she could've saved herself a ''very long day''.\n\nDuring the nurses' strike, she pelted the nurses with half a dozen tuna sandwiches. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")'' At Joe's bar, the nurses retaliated by pouring a drink on Cristina's lap. She then began to get into a fight with the nurses, calling one a soccer mom, but [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] dragged Cristina out of the bar before it could happen. ''(\"[[Break on Through]])''\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nAfter he refused to cross the picket line, Debbie said that she had a newfound respect for George. Debbie and a few other nurses sent George into the hospital so that they could receive reports on their patients. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nShe has a good professional relationship with Richard. He says she is like family and also says that while Adele keeps him in check at home, Debbie is the one that keeps him in line at work. She informs Adele of what he is doing at the hospital and calls her if Richard is stuck in surgery and won't make it home for dinner. Debbie also reminds him about birthdays, holidays, and wedding anniversaries. For his th birthday, Debbie threw a surprise party at the hospital and Richard says he will never forget it. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she started at Seattle Grace, she was intimidated by [[Ellis Grey]] and says she was the Cristina Yang of her class. Debbie says that Ellis is still is one of the most skilled doctors she ever worked with. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\nShe worked at Seattle Grace as a nurse from the time of Ellis Grey and remained until at least [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] second year of residency. She was a large part of the nurses' strike when the hospital was understaffed. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\nBefore working at Seattle Grace, she worked at County Hospital.

And it's not always in our hands.|'''[[Derek Shepherd]]'''}}\n\n'''Derek Shepherd''' was a renowned [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]], and board director at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He was married to [[Meredith Grey]] and they have two daughters, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] and [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], and a son, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]]. He died from his injuries after being hit by a truck.\n\n\n\nDerek spent most of his life prior to his arrival in Seattle in New York City. Derek and his sisters attended a French Preschool. As a child, Derek had no hair products, so he had a large afro, acne, a weight of  pounds, and played the saxophone in the school band. He was raised by a single parent, his mother Carolyn, along with his four sisters: Nancy, Kathleen, Liz, and Amelia. Like Derek, all four of his sisters are doctors. His father owned a shop when he was younger, and one day two robbers approached him and demanded that he give up the watch his wife Carolyn had saved tirelessly to buy for him. When he refused, the robbers shot him to death, with Derek and his younger sister Amelia bearing witness to his death while hiding in the back of the store. This event forms a large part of Derek's moral compass and consequently may have inspired him to become a surgeon to help save lives. As a result, he is especially cynical when treating criminals and feels that they do not deserve any compassion from him.\n\nWhile in high school, Derek played hockey. One day, he pushed his friend into the wall and his friend got hurt, but got up and continued to play. It wasn't until the next day that he found out that he developed a brain bleed. He was left in a vegetative state for the rest of his life. Every month, Derek sent money to his friend's mother to help pay for his long-term care.\n\nDerek's childhood best friend was [[Mark Sloan]], who came from a wealthier but emotionally deficient background and was like a second son to the Shepherd family.\n\nDerek used to ride a motorcycle, but after an accident that gave him a scar, he stopped doing so.\n\nDerek went to [[Bowdoin College]] in Maine for his undergraduate years. He then attended [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] with [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] and [[Mark Sloan|Mark]]. During his medical education, Derek was taught by Richard Webber.\n\n\nAfter Addison cheated on him with Mark, Derek left his private practice in New York and accepted Richard Webber's offer to come work for him at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] with the possibility of becoming the Chief once Webber retired. Derek became aware that Burke was in the running too after he was hired. His sudden move to Seattle made him a curiosity to the other doctors as he gave up a well-established and respected practice in New York.\n\n\nWhile Richard was getting treatment for his alcoholism, Derek became Chief of Surgery. The job required more paperwork and less surgery than he thought, and after being in the shooting he was very cautious and didn't want that responsibility, which led to his resignation.\n\n\nGary Clark was a grieving widower whose wife was taken off of life support. He blamed the doctors who had taken her off of life support. He attempted a lawsuit against the hospital but had no case. Still grieving heavily, he went on a shooting spree at Seattle Grace Mercy West. He killed Dr. Charles Percy, Nurse Vivian, Dr. Reed Adamson, and  other people, including  security guards. He also shot Alex Karev, Owen Hunt, and Derek Shepherd, along with four others who were injured, but not killed. The stress of witnessing his shooting caused Meredith to miscarry. Derek coped with the traumatic experience by speeding. He was arrested multiple times for speeding, which led to Meredith leaving him in jail overnight. He quit his job as Chief of Surgery, having intended to do so for some time as he realized he preferred to be in the O.R. instead of doing administrative work. He told the psychologist Dr. Andrew Perkins that the shooting gave him the courage to step down and quit. After getting arrested prior to Cristina and Owen's wedding, Meredith told him about her miscarriage and begged him to stop making her worry about his speeding.\n\n\nInspired by Meredith's mother's disease, Derek decided to try and find a way to cure Alzheimer's. He initially selected Alex to work with him on the trial, but Alex couldn't handle how depressing it was, so Derek asked Meredith to work with him instead. When Richard started to get worried about Adele's mental condition (he knew she had Alzheimer's), he asked Derek to have her put into the trial. She did not get into the trial because her Alzheimer's has not progressed far enough yet, which was shown by testing. Eventually, she did get put into the trial because of her rapidly progressing disease. Meredith switched the envelopes to make sure Adele got the active agent and not the placebo and in doing so she tainted the trial. Meredith would have been punished for her actions, but Richard stepped in and took the blame, knowing that she only did what she did because she wanted to help Adele. The trial data was sent to another doctor to continue the work and Derek was blacklisted by the FDA.\n\n\nDerek came to Seattle with a reputation as a gifted surgeon who had a penchant for taking on \"hopeless\" cases and highly complex procedures that are often passed on by his peers. After being blacklisted by the FDA for the Alzheimer's trial incident, Derek resumed taking on impossible cases. He took Lexie under his wing and they worked on those cases together.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Derek's hand after the plane crash]]\nAfter having to smash his left hand with a rock to free it from plane wreckage, Derek's hand was severely injured. Many bones were broken and there was significant nerve damage. Callie was able to fix his hand, with the help of the donation of a nerve from the leg of Derek's sister [[Liz Shepherd|Liz]]. This was a very long fight for Derek. He thought he would never operate again and resulted in teaching the interns in the skills lab.\n\n\nNot much time after promising Meredith to take a step back to take care of the kids so she could shine, Derek teamed up with Callie to create robotic limbs that could move through mind control. Derek developed special sensors that had to be inserted in the skull in order for the robotic limbs to work. Upon Owen's request, Derek sat down with guys from the President's brain mapping initiative as they expressed interest in using his sensors for their project too. On top of denying them the rights to his sensors, Derek told them they were approaching their project all wrong and set them in the right direction. Later that day, Derek was called by the President, who asked him to join his brain mapping initiative.\n\nDerek accepted the offer and started working with his new colleagues from his office at Grey Sloan Memorial. He kept contact through video calls. He was shown to be of great value to their project when they bent the rules when he stated he'd quit if they wouldn't let Callie continue to use the sensors too. Initially, Meredith resented the fact that he didn't keep his promise to take a step back, as now she had to take a step back to take care of the kids. As he became more and more important, occasional business trips to Washington D.C. were required. Luckily for him and Meredith, his sister Amelia decided to stay in Seattle, thus being able to take over his service, so that he could brain map to his heart's content, and help them take care of the kids, giving Meredith the time she needed for her career. When Derek returned from one of the trips to D.C., he had met the President, who was so interested that he wanted to make the meeting a weekly thing. He offered Derek a permanent position at the NIH and an attending position for Meredith at James Madison Hospital, so Derek could do the actual brain mapping work himself.\n\nMeredith initially wanted to join Derek, but Cristina told her that even though Derek is dreamy, Meredith is the sun, not him. Meredith then decided to stay in Seattle as that's where she grew up and started her family, and she didn't want to be a trailing spouse like her father was to her mother. Derek didn't really understand why, as there'd be nothing she couldn't do in D.C. that she would be able to do in Seattle. However, he decided that Meredith and the kids were more important to him and he turned down the job, even though Meredith didn't ask him to.\n\nThis rendered him bitter and angry all the time, as Meredith wasn't happy with his choice, never showing that she was supportive of his decision. He pressured Meredith to make the most of her career to make up for the sacrifice he made, which she soon grew tired off. During a heated argument, he compared her to her cold mother, resulting in a radio silence between the two. He also constantly butted heads with Amelia, who took over his job as Head of Neurosurgery. He tried to get his old job back but later apologized for that. She understood that he gave up a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but didn't think that was reason enough to take out his anger on the people around him.\n\nMeredith and Derek only managed to speak to each other in \"time-outs\" regarding Maggie, whom they discovered to be Meredith's half-sister. He threw a dinner party, but he and Meredith got too wrapped up in a sexual encounter after months of denying him sex to make it in time. While he started to keep himself under control at home, he still had difficulties at work. When a woman spilled Amelia's secrets about her drug abuse history in the hospital, he simply took her case when the woman requested another doctor for her parents rather than supporting his sister and defending her. In the evening, he admitted to Amelia that he lost himself, not recognizing himself anymore. He wanted to do right by everyone around him, but he only ended up hurting them. He was angry and miserable all the time and didn't know what to do with himself anymore. Amelia said that that feeling is what they call rock bottom.\n\nDerek later butted heads with Meredith over a case. She suspected that he did that because of their latest fights. He acknowledged to Richard that she had every reason to think that, but he assured him that it wasn't the case. They both recognized Ellis in Meredith, this time in the sense of the ambitious surgeon. Throughout the day, a personal assistant of the President's came back to Seattle to offer him the job again, but he refused again. The situation resulted in his biggest fight with Meredith just yet, with him stating he was done compromising himself for her. She replied he did, making her feel his pissiness and resentment all day. He explained that was because she never showed support for his decision, instead trying to prove all the time that he made the wrong decision. His recent behaviors made it clear for her that she had proven it, as he couldn't be happy anymore, diminishing everyone around him. \"I gave up everything!\" he yelled, once again expressing how important the brain mapping initiative was for him. Meredith pointed out that he was the only one keeping him down, as she never asked him to stay, and stated he should've gone do D.C., which he replied was still an option. He took his phone and called the President's assistant, this time accepting the job. He assured Meredith he was really going to leave and walked off to pack his stuff.\n\n\nDerek went to the airport, and right before boarding the plane, he had a phone call with Meredith. They agreed to stop fighting and try to make it work, as neither of them wanted their relationship to end. He went to D.C. and started leading the Brain Mapping Initiative, aided by research fellows. He took an interest in a side project of one of these fellows, [[Renee Collier]], and encouraged her when she felt stuck, eventually even starting to help out with her research. Renee started to develop a romantic interest in him, which ultimately resulted in a kiss between the two. Derek stopped it, saying he loved his wife and didn't want anything else than what he had with her. He quickly left the lab to board a plane to Seattle to go see his wife, forgetting his phone and keys in the lab. At that time, Meredith called him to talk about her day, and Renee picked up the phone, thinking it was Derek calling with another phone. Renee didn't know what to say after answering and hung up, leaving Meredith to think that Derek was cheating on her. Once Meredith and Derek talked, Derek told Meredith he couldn\ut live without her. Meredith said she could live without him but she didn\ut ever want to. The two then hugged and made up. A couple of days after Meredith and Derek were in bed and Derek said that she has always been the one and that Meredith truly did save him. Meredith and Derek then conceived their third child.\n\n\n[[File:Meredithsayinggoodbyetoderek.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith says her last goodbye to Derek.]]\nNot long after his return home, Derek was on his way to the airport for one last trip to D.C. when he witnessed a car crash on a remote road. He immediately leaped into action, saving four people from the wreckage before the emergency officials arrived to take the patients to Dillard Medical Center. Derek returned to his car and began to pull out to turn around when his phone suddenly rang. Leaving the car sideways in the middle of the road, he began reaching for the phone, not noticing an approaching semi, which crashed into the side of his car. Derek was then taken to Dillard where the doctors began examining him. Conscious but unable to speak, he knew that he needed a head CT, and begged in his mind for the doctors to also realize this; one of them, [[Penelope Blake]], quickly did and lobbied to get the CT, but to no avail, as she was repeatedly shut down by her superior, [[Paul Castello]], who believed that Derek's abdominal bleeding was more pressing, even though he was stable enough to get the CT. Derek was rushed to the OR, but by the time the doctors figured out what was going on and managed to bring in a neurosurgeon (whom they had to wait for over an hour after paging him), it was already too late and Derek was pronounced brain dead. Not long after, Meredith, whom the police have brought to the hospital, signed the papers to take him off life-support. She then sat with him as he died, holding his chest and telling him \"You can go\" as he let out his last breath. Interestingly, he continued to narrate in his mind up to almost the very end, even after losing consciousness (and possibly all brain function) -- at one point saying to the attending physicians \"It's too late.\" \"You're too late.\" We are left with the feeling that at some point an ethereal consciousness had taken over where his physical brain was no longer capable.<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nFuneral\nAt Derek\us funeral, it is shown that Cristina is holding Meredith\us hand.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nTired Meredith\nMeredith imagined Derek being with her after completing a long surgery while already being exhausted. She also thought about him as something good to get herself through the surgery.<ref>[[The Room Where It Happens]], x</ref>\n\nDay of the Dead\nDerek was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nInside Meredith's Visions\nWhen Meredith was diagnosed with COVID-, she began to slip in and out of consciousness, often waking up on a beach. Far away on that same beach, Derek stood there, waving and calling her name. Countless times Meredith wanted to come closer to him, walking only to appear back in the same spot. Derek then claimed that the sand \"wasn't real\", and it wouldn't make a difference if he tried walking towards her, much to Meredith's dedication to get to him.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref><ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>Afterwards, they got closer and closer to each other and began to talk about their kids, their family and his death. They had a wedding on the beach and both agreed that Meredith needed to come back because the kids needed her. Derek told her it was not her time yet so she needed to go, although she said there was no pain on the beach. Derek sniffed her hair and hugged her while hearing Zola's voice. Meredith then woke up with Zola by her side and Derek walked away from the beach.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlthough he was sometimes annoyed by his overbearing mother and sisters, he was nonetheless aware of their closeness and had no doubt that all four of his \"very girly\" sisters would be at his bedside if he were ever hurt or sick. He said that he chose surgery as his specialty for the quiet escape and solace of the O.R. His profound hurt over Mark\us affair with Addison back in New York is compounded by his view of Mark as his brother, the one constant male influence in his life since the death of his father as a child. Probably due to his own background and experience of growing up in a large, happy family, he was much more open to meeting Meredith's \"long lost\" half-sisters than she was. He had to encourage her to accept [[Lexie Grey]] and [[Maggie Pierce]] into her life. He took Lexie under his wing and she saw him as the \"big brother\" she never had.\n\nContrary to the lifestyle his salary entitled him to, Derek preferred the simple life and lived in a [[Derek's Trailer|trailer]], much to Addison's horror and everyone else's bemusement, prior to moving in with Meredith. He tried to eat healthy despite his hectic schedule and irregular hours and enjoyed being in nature, especially fishing.\n\nIn contrast to the easy-going Mark, Derek tended to brood. After working on [[Jen Harmon]], who died on his OR table, he spent several weeks hiding out in his trailer. He also tends to hold grudges, as shown when he brought up Addison's affair in a heated argument with Mark and the fact that he still has lingering anger over his father's murder.\n\nDerek tended to have high and exacting standards, sometimes yelling at interns and residents for not meeting them. Although charismatic, his reputation has been known to intimidate the newcomers. However, he was also liked by interns and residents due to his willingness to teach and allow them hands-on experience in his surgeries. He disliked the competitive \"dog eat dog\" attitude displayed by some of the residents and has been known to threaten severe consequences or throw out residents and interns who try to get in on his surgeries through such means.\n\nAt Seattle Grace, he managed to stay friends with Addison, even after their divorce, and was friends with Preston Burke, but was left without friends when they both left [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. He was broken up with Meredith, Bailey didn't want to have a drink with him, and the Chief said he didn't drink. With nobody to talk to, Derek started to talk to Mark again, and they slowly began to rebuild their friendship and soon enough became best friends again. After getting back together with Meredith, he became friends with her housemates and friends, primarily Cristina, Alex, Izzie, and George. They were initially antagonistic towards him as they thought Meredith was sleeping with him to get into the OR, but they quickly accepted him after getting to know him. Derek befriended [[Owen Hunt]] due to his relationship with Cristina, Meredith's \"dark and twisted sister\". After a rocky start to their working relationship, they shared a mutual respect for one another and sometimes hung out with Mark, especially when they have \"girl problems\".\n\nWhen Richard began slipping back into the state of a severe alcoholic, Derek was adamant about Richard seeking treatment for his condition, even if it meant jeopardizing Richard's career in the process. When the hospital board learned that he'd begun drinking again, they presented to him the option of retiring. Derek, on the other hand, stood by the plan that Richard enter a rehab program, sober up, and return to his position as [[Chief of Surgery]]. While still in denial of his predicament, Richard accuses Derek of forcing his problems out into the open so he could get his hands on the position as Chief. While Derek admitted that he did want the job, he still stood by the plan of Richard entering rehab so that Richard could eventually return as Chief. In Richard's absence as chief, Derek assumed the role temporarily.\n\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nDerek married his medical school girlfriend, [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Montgomery]] in , and the two began their residencies, studying under Dr. Richard Webber. Following residencies and fellowships, Derek and Addison quickly became very successful in their respective fields. They appeared to lead an affluent lifestyle, owning both a Manhattan brownstone overlooking Central Park and a home in the Hamptons, as well as running their own private practices. However, their success and busy workloads put a strain on their marriage, and the two grew apart; the emotional distance eventually drove Addison to cheat on Derek with his best friend, [[Mark Sloan]]. Derek himself admitted that he was never around. After discovering Addison in bed with Mark, Derek declared the marriage over and relocated from a private practice to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], accepting a job offer from his former teacher, Dr. Richard Webber, as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Neurosurgery at Seattle Grace Hospital and trading in the brownstone for an Airstream trailer on  acres of rural property on Vashon Island.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[Image:der-mer-sex.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek met his wife, Meredith, waking up after their first encounter.]]\nSoon after arriving in Seattle, Derek met his future wife [[Meredith Grey]] at a bar and went home with her for a one-night stand, only to discover the next day that she was a new surgical intern at the hospital. Although she initially rejected his advances as inappropriate due to their working relationship, Meredith eventually agreed to date Derek, although he failed to tell her about his marriage. His charismatic, charming personality and good looks earned him the nickname \ucMcDreamy\ud among Meredith and her friends. However, their fledgling relationship came to a sudden halt when Addison arrived in Seattle for a consult upon Richard Webber's request.  Addison had also brought divorce papers but made it clear that if Derek was willing to give her a second chance, she wanted to give their marriage another try. Derek struggled over his choice, but ultimately, his sense of obligation to his marriage vows won, and he left Meredith to return to his wife.\n\n[[Image:Candles.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek and Meredith's house of candles.]]\nAfter a -day vacation, Meredith and Derek saw each other for the first time since [[Preston Burke|Burke]] and [[Cristina Yang|Cristina's]] wedding and they both met Meredith's half-sister, Lexie. Later, Derek pulled Meredith aside to ask if their relationship was over, and she said it was. However, they ended up kissing and having \"break-up sex.\" They later said that their relationship consisted of S&M (sex and mockery) only. Derek, thinking about his addiction to having sex with Meredith, told her that he wanted more; he wanted to marry her and have kids with her, to build them a house and have them settle down and grow old together. He wanted to die in her arms when he was  and he wanted them to have a lifetime.&nbsp;Meredith, as she was, said she needed time and walked away, but they continued to have sex. Throughout this, Cristina helped Meredith with her relationship and tried to help her find out what she wanted. \n\nMeredith asked him to live with her, which he agreed to, saying she was flighty like a deer and that they would take baby steps, showing he would show her all the patience she needed. He wanted to force Alex and Izzie to move out, but Meredith didn't, telling him they were her family. However, he said they could stay and that, once again, he would wait until she was ready. When he discovered her mother's diary, he had a conversation with Mark, where his friend asked him about the trailer. He answered that he was more likely to be kicked out by the end of the week, so he keeps the trailer, but she wanted him to stay, so he lends her his trailer so she can read the diary with Cristina, stating that she needs a place where she can be alone.\n\n[[Sydney Heron]]\nAlthough Derek and Sydney were physically close, they weren't yet emotionally close or in an actual relationship. After Derek went on a pity date with [[Sydney Heron]], Meredith was concerned about him dating other women, so she announced to him that she didn't want him to see other women, and even if she wasn't enough for him right now, she was trying and was scared that she would lose him.\n\n[[Rose]]\nShe told him not to say anything yet, so he was unable to tell Meredith that he had just kissed [[Rose]], a nurse who he'd been getting to know and flirting with over the last few days. When Meredith discovered that he had kissed Rose, their relationship ended.\n\nDerek began to date Rose and Meredith entered into therapy with [[Katharine Wyatt|Dr. Wyatt]]. While Derek appeared to be happy in his relationship with Rose, it was clear to those close to him, namely Mark and Addison, that he wasn't. Derek delayed sleeping with Rose and after finally doing so, he admitted to Mark that he had been thinking of Meredith the entire time. Everything finally came to a head when his and Meredith's clinical trial finally saved a life. He tried to find her to celebrate the good news and eventually located her on his land. She had built a house of candles and told him that she was now \"all whole and healed\" and that while she hadn't forgiven him, she wanted them to be \"extraordinary together rather than ordinary apart.\" They kissed before he left to break up with Rose. Rose was angry at him over the break-up, accidentally stabbing him once with a scalpel in the middle of a surgery, which led her to transfer departments.\n\n\nFamily is something that is very important to Derek. His decision to work on his marriage was based largely on his sense of obligation to Addison as his family, the woman with whom he shared \"eleven birthdays, eleven Thanksgivings, and eleven Christmases.\" The choice was not as simple as Derek had anticipated, and he found that he still had very strong feelings for Meredith, even as he tried to repair his marriage to Addison. Shortly before Christmas, he confessed to Addison that Meredith had not just been a fling, but that he'd fallen in love with her; Addison was willing to wait it out, although the situation was complicated further when she and Derek took in Meredith's dog, Doc. Although Derek eventually admitted that the problems in their marriage were partially his fault, his love for Meredith continued to make him emotionally distant from Addison.\n\nWhen Meredith began dating Finn Dandridge, Doc's veterinarian, Derek became so withdrawn and consumed with jealousy that Addison confronted Derek about his ongoing infatuation with Meredith, and even asked Meredith if she was sleeping with Derek. At a hospital-sponsored prom for the chief's dying niece, Derek and Meredith's emotional affair reached the point of no return. After a heated argument in an exam room, Derek and Meredith had sex, but before they could discuss the implications of their actions, Meredith was called away to deal with Izzie, whose fianc\ue had just died. The next day, Addison found Meredith\us panties, which had been left in Derek's tuxedo jacket, and pinned them to the hospital bulletin board, while Derek went to Meredith's house and professed his love to her for the first time. Their reunion, however, was not immediate.\n\nInitially, Derek felt immense guilt over the breakdown of his marriage with Addison and went to the hotel room where she was staying to apologize. Instead, he was appalled to find out that Addison, in a drunken stupor, had called Mark in New York to fly to Seattle for a \"trans-continental booty call.\" To Derek's disdain, Mark decided to take up a position at Seattle Grace in a bid to woo Addison back.  Although he and Addison acknowledged the end of their marriage and began divorce proceedings, Meredith was less certain and decided to date both Derek and Finn before making a decision between the two. While they were dating, Meredith was admitted for an appendectomy, and Finn's concern for her during her illness led Derek to reconsider his pursuit of her. As she recovered from surgery, he told Meredith that he was walking away, freeing her to be with Finn, whom he considered \"the better guy.\" Meredith, however, had already decided that Derek was \"the one\" for her, and broke up with Finn. She kept the break-up from Derek for another week and made the unfortunate timing mistake of telling him just after Addison had confessed that she and Mark had not just been a one-night stand, as she had led Derek to believe, but had actually lived together for two months after Derek left for Seattle.\n\n[[Nancy Shepherd]]\nMeredith's introduction to Derek's family was no less problematic; she stopped by the trailer one night to talk to Derek and discovered a strange woman lying across Derek's bed and Derek, wearing nothing more than a towel and a very startled expression. She would later learn that the woman was Derek\us sister, Nancy, but the explanation of the misunderstanding did not make Meredith any more appealing to Nancy, who continuously referred to Meredith as the \"slutty intern.\" Derek defended Meredith, leading Nancy to acknowledge Derek's feelings for her, but Nancy encouraged her brother to take some time to figure out what he wanted rather than worrying about the women in his life.\n\nFollowing Nancy's advice, Derek asked Meredith for time to take some space for himself and then embarked on a very brief camping trip, which only cemented his desire for Meredith. He found her in the very place they had first met\uJoe's bar\uand they agreed to start their relationship over from the very beginning. While their newly resumed relationship was happy, to begin with, Derek and Meredith began to grow distant after she almost drowned. As the distance between them grew, Derek was tempted to accept a drink from a woman he met at Joe's during Burke's bachelor party, but ultimately refused. The next day, he admitted meeting the woman (who unbeknown to both, was Meredith's half-sister Lexie) to Meredith and confronted her over her level of commitment to their relationship. He told her she was the love of his life but asked that she end the relationship if she was not equally committed. Meredith did not address the issue and instead focused her energies on Cristina's wedding, leaving her relationship with Derek uncertain. After Burke left Cristina at the altar, Meredith made an announcement to the guests that seemed to imply she had given up on her relationship with Derek as well: \"It's over\uso over.\" When Meredith asked her intern to call all four of Derek's sisters to ask for a donor nerve, it is revealed that Nancy still refuses to speak to her and hung up on her.\n\n[[Liz Shepherd]]\nLiz is Derek's younger sister. She donated nerves from her legs for Derek\us hand surgery after the plane crash. Even though Derek initially didn\ut want her to help, he eventually let her.\n\n[[Kathleen Shepherd]]\nKathleen is Derek's older sister. Not much is known about their relationship.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAmelia is Derek's youngest sister. When she was younger, she stole her brother's prescription pad and overdosed. When Derek found her, she was out cold. He performed CPR for a while until an ambulance arrived. She was clinically dead for  whole minutes but was able to be resuscitated. From then on the siblings drifted apart and became estranged.\n\nWhen Derek got shot, Amelia went to Seattle to see him in hopes to restart their relationship. He didn't want her there and made comments on her past with drugs, but before she left for LA again, he talked to her on the hospital parking lot. For the first time, they talked about their father's death and the memories they shared. Derek said that he couldn't call her and tell her he was hurt because ever since their father had died, he had sworn to protect her. He didn't want her to know that pain even exists. They reconnected and their relationship was better ever since.\n\nAmelia visited for a second time when she wanted him to help her with the brain tumor of [[Mason Warner|Mason's]] [[Erica Warner|mother]], that was killing her. It was shortly after she got out of rehab again, so Derek told her she should give up on that impossible task because she was too fragile. Amelia didn't listen and practiced with [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] to perform the surgery fast enough to not kill Erica right on the table. Finally, Derek gave in and agreed to help her because he was sure she would never give up. They later successfully performed the surgery and further bonded over the experience of giving a young boy his mother back.\n\nShortly before Cristina left, Amelia came once again to see her brother in Seattle, announcing she was now engaged to [[James Peterson|James]]. She decided to stay for a while, sometimes scrubbing in with Derek. She was seen having arguments with her fianc\ue and it turned out she wanted to stay permanently. Amelia became head of neurosurgery, taking Derek's job because he wanted to leave for Washington anyway. Before he actually left, they fought a lot in the OR, both not dealing well with the reversed situation of her being his boss. It even came down to him being unclear to Owen about her drug history, so that she almost got fired. He apologized, admitting he wanted his job back.\n\nWhen he eventually returned from DC, he didn't fight his little sister anymore. Derek was okay with taking her orders but Amelia was still suspicious, as she was convinced he wanted his old job back. Their relationship was better than ever despite him only being \"second place.\ud\n\nOne night, they had a conversation about their father again, as they had lost two men who were shot that day. Derek checked on Amelia to make sure she was okay. They sat down and talked about things, her eventually admitting that she was falling in love with Owen. And that she was scared. He reassured her and was totally okay with the idea of her and Owen.\n\nOn the car on his way to DC, before he had the accident, Derek had a call with Amelia. She was doing surgery on a car crash victim with April and Bailey and they talked about him not making it to his flight. The reception got bad and the last thing he said to her was \"Amy, are you there?\" It would be the last thing Amelia would ever hear her brother say as he died shortly after.\n\nShe struggled in the aftermath of Derek's death and would crack morbid jokes about him. Her grudge against [[Penelope Blake|Dr. Penelope Blake]] over her brother's wrongful death drew a wedge between her and her sister-in-law. Meredith wanted to move on and teach Dr. Blake to learn from her mistakes, while Amelia was still vengeful and mistreated her.\n\n[[Carolyn Shepherd]]\nHis mother came to see him and meet Meredith. To begin with, Meredith was nervous and attempted to be the bubbly happy 'Izzie-like' girl that mothers love, including a high ponytail complete with a scrunchie. However, after talking with the true Meredith for only a short while, she told Derek that she was the \"good one\" and gave him the ring his father wanted him to have for the \"one.\ud After accepting the ring, he began to plan a proposal to Meredith but worried that she still might not be ready. But when she mentioned their own future children in passing, he knew that she was ready for marriage. He told Mark he was going to propose, who told Richard Webber, Owen Hunt, and Callie Torres, but kept it secret from Meredith. Everyone suggested a grand proposal so he planned an elaborate one involving roses and a giant teddy bear. However, an emergency call from Addison meant he had to abandon the proposal. After the death of [[Jen Harmon]] (a death he blamed himself for) and learning that he had lost more patients than those he had saved, he became depressed and returned to his trailer after lounging on the couch for several days. He began to drink a large amount and refused to return to work.\n\nRichard informed Meredith about Derek's intention to propose and the ring leading to her going to confront Derek at the trailer. He pushed her away saying that she is \"a lemon\" and that she has just been waiting to get him out of the house. She tells him that she knows about the ring and he shows it to her before batting it into the woods and telling her to go. After being chastised by Richard, Meredith went to see Derek again. Derek asks her whether she would still love him if he wasn't a doctor. Meredith answers no, explaining that Izzie has cancer that has spread to her brain and he is one of only  people in the world who could save her. She couldn't love him if he wouldn't help her. Derek returned to the house and attempted to propose to Meredith but she refused him. He started work again, operating on Izzie. Just before the surgery, Meredith showed up with his ferryboat scrub cap and he asked her to marry him again but she turned him down.\n\nAt the end of her shift, she was waiting for an elevator. After being guided by the chief to the right one, she found a clean-shaven Derek waiting for her. The elevator was decorated with scans of all the surgeries they did together. He recounted the stages of their relationships as they played out during each case. Lastly, he showed her the post-op scans of the different lives they have saved over the years, and, of course, Izzie's brain. \"You got me into the OR,\" he told her. \"If there is a crisis, you don't freeze, you move forward. You push the rest of us to move forward because you've seen worse, you've survived worse, and you know we'll survive too. You say you're all dark and twisty; it's not a flaw, it's a strength. It makes you who you are. I'm not gonna get down on one knee, I'm not gonna ask a question. I love you Meredith Grey, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\" She told him that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him and they kissed. \n\nAs Izzie received treatment for her cancer, Meredith allowed her to plan the wedding for Derek and herself, in which Izzie took great joy in. However, on said wedding day, Izzie began to see Denny again and Bailey and Derek looked into the cause of this hallucination. They discovered another tumor, too small to be seen normally and too small for Derek to operate safely on. With the news of Izzie dying and her previous comments about spending her life with Alex, Derek and Meredith decided to give their wedding to Izzie to give her the happiest day of her life. Meredith and Derek intended to get married at city hall but found they had no time due to Izzie's surgery and the John Doe patient. So they chose to get married by writing their vows on a post-it note. They stated that they'd love each other, even when they hated each other; that they would never walk away and that they would care for each other when they were old, senile and smelly.  The John Doe patient turned out to be their friend George.\n\nEven with their fellow colleagues arguing the two were not actually married, Meredith and Derek viewed themselves as married. They consummated their marriage everywhere, including the kitchen and stairs, and referred to themselves as married. When Meredith chose to donate part of her liver to Thatcher, Derek demanded to be allowed in the OR, stating, \"that's my wife you're cutting into.\" Eventually, they married each other legally, as it facilitated them adopting [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]]. \n\nLater, Meredith gave birth to a baby boy named Derek Bailey Shepherd, to be called \"Bailey\" after Miranda Bailey.\n\n\nProfessionally, Derek is regarded as one of the best [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeons]] in the world. His services result in two million dollars worth of annual revenue for the hospital. He is a \"tumor junkie\" and has performed numerous complicated, risky procedures, including a stand-still operation, two double-barrel brain bypasses, and separation surgery for adult conjoined twins. One of his colleagues and patients [[Isaac (Season )|Isaac]] once commented that the reason he came to Derek to take his spinal tumor out was because Derek, upon seeing his scans, was inspired rather than defeated. His confidence was shaken slightly when his surgery to repair a gunshot injury on a colleague, [[Preston Burke]], resulted in Burke\us hand developing a tremor, but Derek remains a competent and skilled surgeon who has not forgotten the importance of compassion and bedside manner when dealing with patients. He is liked by his patients and their family members as he has a way of putting them at ease.\n\nDerek's professional life hit an obstacle when [[Richard Webber]] announced his plans to retire. Derek had originally been promised the [[Chief of Surgery|chief position]] when Richard offered him the job in Seattle but was surprised to find that the position had instead been offered to Preston Burke. When word got out about Richard's retirement, Addison and Mark joined in the race for chief. Eventually, Webber came to a decision. He offered the Chief position to Derek, but Derek declined it and instead encouraged Richard to stay on as Chief.\n\nDerek's confidence took another blow when he accidentally clipped an aneurysm on a pregnant woman during surgery, remarking that it was unlike him. While [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] is in Seattle tending to [[Archer Montgomery|her brother]], she consults, and Derek suggests a risky procedure, despite knowing nothing of the procedure or its risks, feeling immensely guilty over clipping the aneurysm and will do all in his, or Addison's, power to keep her alive. Unfortunately, she dies later in surgery, upsetting her husband, who calls Derek a murderer in his grief. This sends Derek into a depression. Later, at a deposition, he learns more of his patients have died than survived, which Meredith reasoned was because he often took seriously ill patients who were at their wits' end and had come to him because no other surgeon would operate on them. Nonetheless, he walks out of Seattle Grace.\n\nWhile in his depression, pushing Meredith away and being almost constantly drunk, Bailey sends [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and later [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] to try and bring him back. Derek, however, talks to both of them and makes them feel depressed over those who they have \"killed\", prompting them to start drinking with him, until [[Richard Webber|Richard]] comes and shouts at him, telling him he is in a much better position than he was. He is promoted to Acting Chief of Surgery after Richard is forced into rehab to keep his job. After Derek orders a patient to be taken off life support against her [[Gary Clark|husband's]] wishes, the husband returns to the hospital and searches for Derek, shooting several surgeons on his way to him. The shooter eventually finds Derek and shoots him, forcing Richard to take over as interim Chief during Derek's absence from work. Derek returns and immediately quits as Chief, admitting that he hates the job and just wants to go back to being a neurosurgeon. He later tells the counselor that he had wanted to quit for a long time and the shooting prompted him to finally make the decision.\n\nOver the course of his career, Derek has been the lead surgeon on two clinical trials. The first was initiated by Meredith\upublicized as \"The Shepherd Method\", it is the injection of a live virus into a brain tumor as treatment. The second clinical trial was for the development of a cure for Alzheimer's, which he was able to fund through his earned Phillip's Grant. Derek was then blacklisted by the FDA after it was revealed that the trial was tampered with. The trial was carried on by Carl Baumann in Phoenix.\n\nAfter the plane crash<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>, Derek wasn't able to perform surgery for a while. During this time, he was teaching residents and helping [[Callie Torres]] with her trial on better prosthetics. The work on this trial led him to the development of brain sensors, which caught the attention of the president of the United States. The president requested him for a brain mapping project and gave him the opportunity to run it.\n\n\n*He played saxophone in his high school band. He also played guitar.\n*He had a scar on his forehead from a motorcycle accident.<ref>[[Save Me]], x</ref>\n*He had a thing for [[Ferry Boats|ferry boats]].\n*He drove a Porsche Cayenne\n*When he first moved to Seattle, the floor nurses described him as \"eye candy in a lab coat\"<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n*He was often seen as extremely protective over his sisters, especially [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]].\n*Derek had five kinds of scrub caps, his favorite of which depicts ferry boats.\n*He had a high risk for liver cancer, prostate cancer, baldness, and heroin addiction.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], x</ref>\n*In season one, Derek's lab coat did not show the post-nominal letters of [[Fellow of the American College of Surgeons|F.A.C.S.]]\n*In [[Almost Grown]] and [[These Arms of Mine]], there are scenes that show Derek wearing his \"[[Chief of Surgery]]\" lab coat, despite no longer holding the position at the time.\n*In [[Flight]], Cristina tries to keep everyone conscious, but it's shown that Derek is asleep and dreaming about ferryboats, as his response to Cristina is \"boats\".\n*Before surgery, Derek often said \"''[[It's a Beautiful Night to Save Lives|It's a beautiful day to save lives]]''.\"\n*In [[Save Me]], Derek revealed to Meredith lots of things because he hadn't opened up, ''My mother's maiden name, Maloney. I have four sisters. I have, uh, nine nieces. Five nephews. I like coffee ice cream, single-malt scotch, occasionally a good cigar. I like to fly fish. And I cheat when I do the crossword puzzle on Sunday. And I never dance in public. Um, favorite novel, The Sun Also Rises. Favorite band, The Clash. My favorite color is blue. I don't like light blue, indigo. The scar right here on my forehead, that's why I don't ride motorcycles anymore. And I live in that trailer. All this land is mine. I have no idea what I'm gonna do with it. So that's it. That's all you've earned for now. The rest you're just...just gonna have to take on faith.''\n*Derek claims he never understood Cristina and Dr. Burke's relationship.\n*In [[Here Comes the Flood]], Derek mentions that he is a pain specialist. In subsequent seasons he is shown to be a \"tumor junkie\" who takes on difficult brain or spinal tumors.\n*For Swedish viewers, he is known as Dr. Dr\ufmprins, meaning Dr. Dreamprince. In Brazil he's known as Bonit\ueo, which means \"Handsome\". In Finland he's known as Unelmatohtori, which means \"Dream Doctor\" or \"Doctor of (my) dreams\".\n*He missed his father every second of every minute of every day.\n*His father was never mentioned until [[Wish You Were Here]].\n*Derek's ID badge stated his department was [[Surgery|surgery]] until the merger with [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], and then it was updated to state his department as [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgery]], although there were some scenes that still show his department as surgery.\n*He thought that chewing gum while performing an autopsy is disgusting.\n*In a sense, Derek often rooted for the underdog. He mentored both [[April Kepner]] and [[Heather Brooks]], who at the time he mentored them were not very popular at the hospital.\n*He liked to have  towels in the O.R. in order to support his arms.\n*Derek's last thought was, \"It's too late\".<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref>\n*Derek was one of the \"Grey Sloan Seven\".\n*Derek was one of the \"Seattle Grace Five\".\n*He walked all his sisters except Amelia down the aisle on their wedding days.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n*He made $,, per year.<ref>[[Yesterday]], x</ref>\n*His mortality rate was .%.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n*He went to French preschool.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*His first patient death was when he was a second-year resident and his name was James Hanson.\n*Likened to a Black-Headed Nightingale-Thrush by a patient. \n*His favorite math teacher was Mr. Mulligan.\n*When [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] was , he put Derek's frog in the microwave, but claimed he never pressed start.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Devil]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nDerekShepherd.png\nxDerekShepherd.png\nxDerekShepherd.png\nxDerekShepherd.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Derek-centric or otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Save Me]]\n*[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]]\n*[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\n*[[Let the Angels Commit]]\n*[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\n*[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\n*[[Before and After]]\n*[[Ex-Life]]\n*[[An Honest Mistake]]\n*[[Stand By Me]]\n*[[Give Peace a Chance]]\n*[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\n*[[How Insensitive]]\n*[[Sanctuary]]\n*[[Death and All His Friends]]\n*[[Have You Seen Me Lately?]]\n*[[You Break My Heart]]\n*[[Flight]]\n*[[Remember the Time]]\n*[[Going, Going, Gone]]\n*[[Only Mama Knows]]\n*[[How to Save a Life]]\n*[[The Center Won't Hold]]\n*[[My Happy Ending]]\n*[[It's All Too Much]]\n*[[Good as Hell]]\n\n\n:''' [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] to Derek:''' I have no story.

Eventually Meredith decided to give the dog to Addison and Derek.\n\n\nDuring Christmas, Izzie decorated a tree with many lights and ornaments. At the end of the day, she, George, and Meredith lay under the tree and looked up at the lights. Doc came and joined them under the tree. ''(\"[[Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Doc liked Meredith, he terrorized Izzie and George, leading them to say that something needed to change. Meredith denied this, saying that he's their dog and they love their dog. However, after Doc started eating her laundry, Meredith hid with the others. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\nAfter he peed on Izzie's bed, she insisted that they get rid of him. George backed her up, saying either the dog goes or he goes. When Meredith hesitated, he said he'd be moving out. Izzie made up a flyer to try to get someone else to take Doc. At the end of the day, Izzie refused to take Doc home, so Meredith took him out to [[Derek's Trailer]], where he went to live with Derek and Addison. ''(\"[[Tell Me Sweet Little Lies]]\")''\n\nDespite him living with Derek and Addison, Meredith continued to see Doc, even meeting Derek in the park so they could walk him together.

''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\nFinn ran some tests and said Doc could go home while he waited for the results. Derek took him home, but brought him back that evening, saying he was listless and hadn't eaten all day. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nThe tests revealed that Doc had bone cancer. Finn gave them treatment options, but Derek suggested that it might be more humane to put him down. After consulting with [[Callie Torres]], Meredith realized that Doc wasn't going to get better, a conclusion she confirmed with Finn. He said the best case scenario is that Doc has a year left, but Doc wasn't the best case scenario. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\n\nDoc's cancer spread to his brain and they made the decision to put him to sleep. Although Finn had the means of disposing him, Meredith did not want him thrown away like garbage and so Derek agreed to have him buried at the clearing by trailer, overlooking the water.

Meredith initially believed they should amputate, but when she found a viable finger, she changed her mind and they made steps to save his hand. When they talked about cutting through the grinder to free his hand, his brothers objected, saying it was expensive. They said they had to take it apart every night to clean it anyway, so Callie let them take it apart to free Dominic's hand. To buy Dominic more time, they applied a tourniquet above the grinder.\n\nOnce they got it apart, Callie told his brothers to leave while they turned back the auger and released Dominic's hand. They didn't leave right away and when his hand was pulled out, they both passed out on the floor. His hand was severely injured and only two of his fingers were left attached. While Meredith and Callie were in the OR working on Dominic's hand, Meredith determined that one of his amputated fingers was still viable and could be reattached, but Callie said the thumb wasn't, so Dominic would be better off with a prosthetic as the thumb is responsible for % of hand function. Meredith suggested that they take his big toe to replace his thumb, but Callie said that his big toe is too important for his balance, so they'd take the second toe instead.

Andrew was immediately suspicious of the fact that Opal did all the talking while Cindy just stood there. He shared his concerns with [[Nurse Liv]] and asked her to get Bailey for him. Meanwhile, he ran additional tests to keep Opal and Cindy in the clinic. Bailey came down to the clinic, but doubted Andrew's claims. She went to check on Cindy herself and didn't detect anything unusual in their reactions, so she told Andrew to treat Cindy and let it go. Despite this, he persisted. He promised Cindy a spot in Meredith's pro bono surgery day for her hernia and used that as an excuse to get Cindy away. He then questioned her, but she revealed nothing and Opal quickly discovered them. A crowd gathered and they tried to talk Andrew down, even as he continued to call for security to arrest Opal. They eventually got Andrew to leave the area and Opal and Cindy embraced. However, later, Opal dragged Cindy out of the hospital by her arm, saying she must have said something to the doctor to tip him off, though Cindy swore she didn't. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\nErin later came back to the hospital. She said that she had gotten sicker and so Opal dropped her off on the side of the interstate, proclaiming her useless. At the hospital, she was examined again and told the doctors her real name and that she was from Scottsdale, Arizona. She'd been \"discovered\" on Snapchat. The photographer wanted to meet her, but her parents and sister all said it was sketchy. She decided to sneak out and go anyway and ended up spending two years being trafficked. Opal threatened to kill her if she ran away and said she'd take her sister if she told anyone. She had surgery to repair her hernia and was given IV antibiotics post-op. When she was found, her sister, Abby, was going to school in Portland and came to Seattle, where they were happily reunited.

He gave them treatment options, but Derek said it might be better to put him to sleep, so he wouldn't suffer. After consulting with [[Callie Torres]] on bone cancer, Meredith asked Finn to tell her the truth. He said that best case is the Doc had a year left, but he wasn't the best case. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\nThe next day, Finn told Meredith that Doc had had some seizures. The cancer had spread to his brain and there was nothing Finn could do.

She said she'd like to go on a date, but he hesitated. She thought it meant he wasn't interested anymore, but he said he just had an errand to run, but invited her to come along. She went with him and watched as he birthed a horse. He then invited her to come up to his place so he could cook her dinner. She was reluctant, but ultimately went upstairs with him on the condition that they wouldn't be having sex. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nThey continued to see each other, including Finn making Meredith breakfast. When he asked her about the last guy she dated, she fled. At that point, they'd been on four dates and hadn't yet kissed. Meredith later said he didn't want to get involved with her, saying she was scary and damaged and he didn't want to get into that. He revealed that he had his own share of damage and they shared a kiss. ''(\"[[Damage Case]]\")''\n\nHe and Meredith went to the hospital prom together. However, she left the prom and had sex with Derek in an exam room. At the end of the night, when Finn offered to drive her home, she was stuck looking between the two of them. ''(\"[[Losing My Religion]]\")''\n\nThe day after the prom, Finn came to Meredith's house to see her, but she made an excuse about checking on Izzie to avoid him. When she came back in, he said he didn't know what happened the previous night and didn't want to know. He then said if there was a ring, his hat was in. ''(\"[[Time Has Come Today]]\")''\n\nMeredith thought she had chosen Derek, but when Finn showed up at the house to bring Izzie lunch without knowing that Meredith was even there, she saw how great Finn was and thought she might pick him. Unable to make a decision, she called both of them to the bar where she told them that she planned to date both of them to consider her options. ''(\"[[I Am a Tree]]\")''\n\nFinn stopped by the hospital to bring Meredith coffee cake and invite her to dinner. However, she already had dinner plans with Derek, so they settled on lunch at the hospital instead. They had lunch, but were interrupted by Derek offering Meredith a surgery. That night, Finn stopped by the house to bring Meredith homemade strawberry ice cream made by one of his patients. He bickered with Derek, who came home with Meredith. Meredith yelled at them, saying she wanted to be wooed. ''(\"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith needed an appendectomy, Finn came to visit her. He waited in her room while she was in surgery. After her surgery, Derek told Meredith he was walking away and letting her be with Finn. Despite this, Meredith told Finn that Derek was the one.

She'd previously been told that it was probably a migraine, but since the medicine didn't work, she came back into the ER with her husband, Randy. While describing the pain to Meredith, Janell had a seizure, so Meredith had Derek paged and called for an EEG.\n\nJanell wasn't responding to the migraine medication, so Derek suggested putting her in a medically-induced coma so that the seizures wouldn't damage her brain. Randy agreed and Janell was put into a coma.\n\nMeredith noticed that Janell had hemolytic anemia, which indicated an autoimmune response. Meredith figured out that she had a teratoma. They found a mass on her lung that she believed was the teratoma, so they scheduled surgery to remove it. However, after they removed it, pathology determined that the mass was a benign granuloma, so the search for the teratoma continued.\n\nThe most likely location of the tumor was in her ovaries, so they went back to Randy to ask him about it and he said that Janell wanted kids, so he refused to let them remove her ovaries.\n\nIn surgery, they noticed a lot of adhesions on her right ovary, which could indicate a tumor, so they removed the right to examine it for microscopic tumors. When it came back clean, they removed her other ovary, effectively sterilizing her.\n\nThe pathologist looked at the specimen. He said that he needed to look at more slides to confirm it, but Meredith pushed him aside and looked at it herself. Then she and Bailey pushed him to say it was a teratoma.\n\nAfter the surgery, Janell's coma was reversed and she was pain-free.\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Randy Barnett]].

The post-operative stroke is a rare outcome for any surgery, and he assured her they'd persue any avenue to rehabilitation even though he was afraid they wouldn't be able to fix it. Jackson answered Karen's questions, telling her that Dalton is awake even though he can't speak or move. Jackson assured her they'd do anything they can and apologized.

The cause of the seizures was a mystery, so Derek recruited the interns to help him figure out the cause. Cristina and Meredith paired up to find the solution. While they were going over research and discussing various options, Meredith had an epiphany. She remembered Katie telling her about her previous fall. She believed that fall had burst an aneurysm. Derek had doubts, but agreed to check. He ran a scan and found out that Meredith was correct. Katie was bleeding into her brain, which caused the seizures. Meredith scrubbed in with him and they operated.

Drive to save lives, to make things better. And despite all that she's lost, she continues to find joy in her work as a surgeon, as a teacher, as a mother. And she managed to share that joy through her spirit of discovery and of possibility and of hope, right in the face of darkness.|'''[[Jackson Avery]]'''}}\n\n'''Meredith Grey''' is the [[Chief of Surgery]], former [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of [[General Surgery|general surgery]] and former [[Resident|Director of the Residency Program]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She is the daughter of the now-deceased [[Ellis Grey]], a famed general surgeon, and the now-deceased [[Thatcher Grey]]. She was married to [[Derek Shepherd]] until his death; they have two daughters, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] and [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], and a son, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]]. She has won a [[Catherine Fox Award]].\n\n\n\nWhen Meredith was young, her father, [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]], would bring her to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to visit her mother, [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]], at work. As a small child, Meredith got to see her mother perform surgery. As a gift, Meredith was given an \"[[Anatomy Jane]]\" doll by her parents, which contained  parts/organs to take out, and extra parts to simulate pregnancy. Meredith would bring the doll with her to the hospital. Years later, an adult, and now a doctor, Meredith uncovered the doll while she and Derek were unpacking boxes in their house, which was previously owned and inhabited by her mother and father before their divorce, and by her mother after, until Meredith was forced to place her mother in [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]], due to Ellis suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's. The doll brought up old memories for Meredith, along with a renewed attachment to the doll that resulted in adult Meredith bringing it to work with her one day. Upon recognizing an Anatomy Jane doll and her own remembered fondness for her own as a child, [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] allowed Meredith to scrub into surgery that day on a patient being treated for an inoperable tumor. During the surgery, it was obvious that [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] was quite disturbed, and also feeling a little guilty, at the sight of the doll, as he had been reminded of a young Meredith craving her mother's attention and love, yet not getting it since Ellis was not only very focused on her surgical career but also because he and Ellis were having an affair when they were both interns and residents. \n\nMeredith's parents had a troubled marriage, though part of this was due to [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]] spending too much time working and normal everyday problems. But a large part was due to the fact that for years, Ellis had been involved in an affair with one of her colleagues and best friends, [[Richard Webber]]. Their marital issues proved too great, and eventually, [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]] left the home when Meredith was five years old. He tried to visit her on several occasions, but he got nowhere. Eventually, he stopped seeing his daughter and subsequently started a new family with his new wife, [[Susan Grey]], and had two children.\n\nWhen Thatcher left Ellis, she continued her relationship with Webber, although he still had a wife, Adele. Although Richard tried to conceal his relationship with Ellis, Adele always knew, so if she was in their company, she would just play with Meredith. Eventually, Richard broke off his relationship with Ellis, as he felt he was being the better man, by walking away from Ellis, with Meredith only meters away, riding on a carousel. Meredith vaguely remembered her mother's pregnancy with Webber's child after he broke it off. In the memory, Ellis made it clear that she did not want to even look at the child. Shortly thereafter, Ellis accepted a fellowship opportunity at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She relocated to [[Massachusetts]] with Meredith, and Thatcher lost all contact with his daughter. As an adult, her only childhood memory of Thatcher was giving her cereal in the morning.[[Image:YoungMeredith.png|thumb|left|px|[[Time Has Come Today|Meredith as a child.]]]]\n\nIn the th grade, her English class had to read ''Romeo & Juliet.'' For extra credit, their teacher Mrs. Snyder made them act out all the parts. A boy named Sal Scafarillo was chosen for Romeo, and all the girls were jealous of Meredith, who was chosen for Juliet. But Meredith was not happy, and she complained to her teacher that Juliet was an idiot because she had fallen for the one man she knew she could never have. Then she blamed fate for her own bad decision. She told her that if Juliet was stupid enough to fall for the enemy, drink a bottle of poison and go to sleep in a mausoleum, then she deserved whatever she got. Therefore, at the age of , she was very clear that love, like life, was about making choices. Meredith later described her high school years to Cristina by saying, \"I wore a lot of black. Had the whole angry pink hair thing going on. Wouldn't have been caught dead at prom.\"\n\nShe went to college at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], and despite excessive drinking and partying, she graduated. Following her graduation, Ellis suggested that Meredith find another direction in her life, not being convinced that her daughter had what it took to survive medical school and make it in the surgical world. Following an argument about Meredith's future, Meredith spent two months traveling in [[Europe]] with her best friend [[Sadie Harris]], who also hated Ellis. But during that time, Meredith's mother Ellis Grey was diagnosed with early-onset [[Medical Glossary#A|Alzheimer's disease]] and placed into a nursing home in Seattle. Ellis's diagnosis gave Meredith the push she needed to go to medical school. After graduating from medical school, Meredith moved back to Seattle from Boston and into her childhood home in order to begin her internship at Seattle Grace. Meredith was the only one who knew about her mother's condition outside the nursing home staff, whose personnel were bound by contract to keep Ellis's condition confidential. Ellis also made Meredith promise not to tell anyone.\n[[File:Anatomy Jane.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith's \"Anatomy Jane\" doll.]]\nCristina later helped \"diagnose\" Meredith as having a case of \"severe abandonment issues,\" as the cause of her relationship problems with Derek, due to the fact that Thatcher left her, when she was a child, that she had to suddenly leave her childhood home when she was five, and that Ellis was absent for most of her childhood, due to her work and the affair she was having with Richard.\n\n\nAfter having a one-night stand with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] without knowing that he was her boss, she and Derek began dating, initially discreetly. But soon Bailey, Meredith's resident, caught her and Derek together and made it her mission to make Meredith's life at work as miserable as possible, as she was involved with her boss, who was also Bailey's boss. Meredith soon learned that Derek was still married when his wife, [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]], came to Seattle to get Derek back. At first, Meredith was angry with Derek for not telling her, but she later admitted to still loving him and begged him to \"pick me, choose me, love me.\" When Addison handed him the divorce papers to end their relationship officially, Derek remained hesitant and soon after decided to stay with Addison, much to Meredith's dismay. Although the two constantly flirted and Derek still hinted at having feelings for her, they both agreed to remain friends, and Addison, too, attempted to be friends with Meredith.\n\nWhen Derek's best friend, [[Mark Sloan]], visited Seattle, he was quick to realize that Meredith was \"the one\" for Derek and tried to persuade Addison to stop fighting for her marriage as Meredith was Derek's, true love. Meanwhile, Meredith rescued a dog, [[Doc]], in an effort to move on, but after her housemates, Izzie Stevens and George, gave her an ultimatum to choose them or Doc, she gave the dog to Derek and Addison. Doc was taken to the vet and diagnosed with bone cancer. Meredith started to date Finn the vet, much to Derek's annoyance. Meredith dating Finn also caused Derek to end the friendship with Meredith and call her a whore.\n\nOn the night of the Seattle Grace Hospital Prom, Derek went with Addison, while Meredith went with Finn. The two soon after met with each other in an exam room where Derek confessed that he still loved her and they had sex. Addison discovered Meredith's underwear in Derek's pocket and the two finally agreed to divorce. Meredith, however, was still dating Finn and issued a contest between the two boys to see which she would settle with. She ultimately chose Derek and they reconciled. \n\n\n[[File:xDrowningmeredith.jpg|thumb|xpx|Derek saves Meredith from almost drowning in Elliot Bay.]]\nMeredith, Izzie, George, Alex, and Bailey went to the site of a massive [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] accident. After Meredith finished stabilizing a patient's badly wounded leg with the help of a little girl just by the water, the man panicked and pushed Meredith off the edge into the bay. Later, when Derek was shown Meredith's fate by the little girl, he jumped into the water and then retrieved a pale, seemingly lifeless Meredith. He tried to perform CPR in the ambulance, but she did not respond. The doctors all tried to revive her, but she flatlined. Then Meredith entered a state of limbo in her mind, where she interacted with deceased acquaintances like [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny]], [[Dylan Young]], [[Doc]], [[Bonnie Crasnoff]], [[Elizabeth Fallon|Liz Fallon]], and her own mother, [[Ellis Grey]]. Eventually, she left this state of limbo and came back to life slowly. Meredith recovered, but Derek remained concerned that Meredith was a good swimmer, and that perhaps she had not tried hard enough and had given up.<ref>[[Walk on Water]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen one of Derek's patients, [[Jen Harmon]], found out that Derek was going to propose to Meredith, the two started to become friends and she wanted to help with the proposal. When she died, Derek blamed himself for her death. He ended up quitting his job and he moved back into his trailer. Richard told Meredith later that day that Derek was going to propose to her. Later that night, Meredith went to the trailer to find Derek drunk and hitting empty beer cans into the woods with a baseball bat. They started to argue and Meredith said, \"I know there's a ring!\" Derek froze. Meredith then told him that the chief had told her about the ring and that she was not going to give up on them. Derek then hit the ring into the woods. The next time Meredith went to see Derek at the trailer, she told him Izzie had metastatic melanoma and that it spread to her liver, skin, and brain. And that he was the most qualified surgeon to remove the tumor. Derek later asked Meredith to marry him, but she rejected his proposal. Derek ended up going back to work and removed Izzie's brain tumor successfully. That night, Derek proposed to Meredith in the elevator, which was decorated with surgical scans from their past cases. This time, Meredith accepted.<ref>[[Elevator Love Letter]], x</ref> Izzie Stevens began to plan the wedding, but right before, Derek and Meredith decided to give the wedding to her and Alex Karev.<ref>[[What a Difference a Day Makes]], x</ref> Later, Derek and Meredith got married in the resident's lounge, on a blue Post-It note from Cristina Yang.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Meredith was treating a John Doe, who soon would be identified as [[George O'Malley]], he attempted to write on a pad before surgery but wasn't successful. While recovering in the ICU, he attempted again to write on Meredith's hand, and she soon realized that it was George after he traced \"\" on her hand multiple times. Meredith was alarmed and alerted the other doctors, who originally believed her when he was taken in for brain surgery. During George's brain surgery, his brain swelled and he was declared brain dead. Lexie thought it wasn't George because she didn't think he was tall enough, so Callie checked for a Texas-shaped birthmark on his hand, which she saw, confirming it was George.\n\n\nDuring the start of the merger with Mercy West Medical Center, Meredith was hospitalized from having donated a portion of her liver to her father, Thatcher Grey, since he was unable to be placed on the transplant list due to his alcoholism.<ref>[[Tainted Obligation]], x</ref> Richard's drinking escalated again, causing him to make an error during surgery which almost killed a patient, until Dr. Bailey stepped in, fixing the problem<ref>[[New History]], x</ref> and scheduling weekly followups with the patient to ensure he had no lasting effects.<ref>[[Blink]], x</ref> Richard's alcoholism led him to do one-on-one teaching sessions where he showed Meredith various surgical techniques and she discovered his drinking again.<ref>[[Holidaze]], x</ref> She kept this from Derek, but he became very angry with Meredith and made her tell him what was going on.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref> When Derek found out about the drinking, he reported Richard to the board, forcing him to either step down from surgery and go to rehab or retire. When he chose rehab, Derek was named the interim Chief of Surgery.<ref>[[State of Love and Trust]], x</ref>\n\n\nNear the end of their third year of residency, Meredith revealed to Cristina that she was pregnant. She also planned on telling Derek, but the mass shooting intervened. The husband of a deceased patient, [[Gary Clark]], entered the hospital and shot many people, killing many, including [[Reed Adamson|Dr. Reed Adamson]] and [[Charles Percy|Dr. Charles Percy]]. The hospital was placed in lockdown while the shooting occurred. Gary Clark also shot Derek in the chest while Meredith watched from afar. Cristina had to do his surgery herself after barring Meredith from the OR. When the shooter entered the OR, Meredith entered too and told him to shoot her. However, he ended up shooting Owen, though his injuries were comparatively minor. While tending to Owen's injury, Meredith suffered a miscarriage.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the shooting, all involved were made to go through a psych consult to be cleared for surgery. Meredith was the last one to be cleared. She was cleared by Dr. Andrew Perkins only after she admitted her pregnancy and miscarriage.\n\nDerek began speeding to cope with the trauma and was arrested several times for \"reckless endangerment.\" The only people that knew about Meredith's miscarriage were Cristina, Owen, and April. Meredith ended up leaving him in jail on the night of Cristina and Owen's wedding. The next day, angered at having been left in jail overnight, Derek had an argument with Meredith in the hospital hallway. Derek tried to calm Meredith down and Meredith admitted that she had been worried about him since he started speeding and the only time she got relief was when he was in jail because she knew he was safe. She then told him about her miscarriage. Derek and Meredith kissed and hugged, and Derek agreed to drive more carefully from that point on.\n\n\nThe couple had recently been told that Meredith had a hostile uterus and conceiving a child would be difficult. Meredith and Derek met Zola when she was brought to the hospital for a spina bifida operation as part of Alex's program. Derek immediately bonded with Zola and suggested adoption. Meredith took a little longer to bond with Zola, but eventually, she was unable to avoid falling in love with the child. However, Derek found out that Meredith had tampered with his Alzheimer's trial just as the couple was granted temporary custody of Zola. When the social worker on their case, Janet, discovered that Meredith and Derek weren't living together and that Meredith had been fired, red flags were raised in the system. Fearing that she would lose Zola, Meredith hid with Zola in the basement of the hospital for  hours. Zola was taken away from them for a time, during which Meredith and Derek rekindled their relationship. They were given a date to see a judge about the adoption after Alex went to the judge directly. That date was subsequently canceled and Janet told them that it was unlikely that it would end in their favor and suggested that they move on. But the decision did end in their favor, and Janet brought Zola to them, finalizing the adoption.\n\n\nAt the end of her residency, Meredith, along with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], was involved in a plane crash on the way to Boise to help in a conjoined twins case. Lexie died due to a part of the plane crushing her, and Meredith was horrified and mourned. The plane crash also led to Mark's death, Arizona's loss of her leg, and Derek's severely damaged nerves in his hand.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nThe group ended up spending four days out in the woods before they were found and airlifted to [[Boise Memorial Hospital]], where they were treated before being sedated and flown back to Seattle.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nAll the survivors of the plane crash filed a lawsuit against the plane company. Their attorney informed the survivors that they would be pursuing action against the hospital instead of the plane company since the hospital put them on the plane. This alarmed the doctors. However, they decided to go ahead with the lawsuit, because Derek went to see the plane wreckage and believed if they settled, they wouldn't properly investigate what went wrong so it couldn't happen again to someone else.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors went to trial and were awarded $ million each. Callie decided that their win should be celebrated, and Meredith, Derek, Callie, Arizona, and Cristina all went to dinner to celebrate, where Meredith revealed that she was pregnant.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\nDuring Meredith's pregnancy, [[Alana Cahill|Dr. Alana Cahill]] was brought to the hospital to assess efficiency, as the plane crash verdict forced the hospital into bankruptcy after its insurance refused to pay the penalties after finding a loophole.<ref>[[Walking on a Dream]], x</ref> The doctors learned that Dr. Cahill was planning to clean up the hospital so that it could be sold to a company called Pegasus Horizons. But Richard and Callie conducted additional research of the company and learned that it would be a terrible asset to the hospital.<ref>[[The Face of Change]], x</ref> They brought the survivors together for a secret meeting and discussed purchasing the hospital so they could maintain the hospital in which all the doctors had been trained and which they still loved.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors went to investors looking for a partner to come up with enough money to purchase the hospital. After exhausting all their other investment options, they eventually were given $ million by the Harper Avery Foundation to purchase the hospital. The Harper Avery Foundation, led by [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]], made Jackson Avery their spokesperson on the board,<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref> which upset all the other doctors. They, however, all resolved the conflict when Jackson tried to bring the board together by proposing the hospital be renamed to reflect their beliefs and reasoning behind purchasing the hospital in the first place. This resulted in Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital being renamed to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in , after Lexie Grey and Mark Sloan, the two fatalities of the plane crash.<ref>[[Transplant Wasteland]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite Derek's warnings to slow down, a heavily pregnant Meredith couldn't keep from joining in on a surgery at the beginning of the superstorm. However, Meredith was forced to leave when there was a risk of explosions in the OR. She talked to [[Alex Karev|Alex]] about beating up [[Jason Myers]], only to find out that [[Jo Wilson|Jo]] was the one who had beaten up Jason. She followed Jo into a staircase, where Jo promised she would never let Alex take the fall for what happened to Jason. As Jo left, a construction worker told Meredith that they were done with the grinder in the OR. \"Then why aren't I up there?\" she angrily asked, and as she ran up the stairs, she slipped and rolled down the stairs. She sent Derek a message and got checked out by [[Connie Ryan]], and she promised that everything was fine with the baby. While the surgeons were preparing the hospital and the storm hit Seattle, Meredith's water broke.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was admitted but had to wait for Connie, who was busy with other soon-to-be mothers. Cristina, who found it typical for Meredith to go in labor during a superstorm, stayed by her side while Derek went to look for Connie. He found her, but as she did a check-up on Meredith, she told them that there was face presentation. As she mentioned that a C-section was necessary to deliver the baby safely, the lights went out and the back-up generators failed to engage. Even though they were, at first, hesitant to perform surgery in the dark, they realized there were no other options. The surgery went well, and Derek took his newborn son to the NICU to make sure everything was fine. While closing up, Connie got called away for another mother in need, and she and Meredith trusted Shane to close up. However, Heather and Shane discovered heavy bleeding, and Meredith realized that she had suffered an internal bleed from her fall on the stairs. Before losing consciousness, Meredith instructed Shane, who had found out that her spleen was bleeding, how to stop the bleed. Meanwhile, Heather went to find Dr. Bailey to assist them. Bailey overcame her fear to operate and pulled Meredith through. Meredith was kept in the OR until she was stable and later moved to a room in the maternity ward, where Derek and Zola visited her and their new family member.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a board meeting in her room, the others informed Meredith what had happened during the superstorm. She tried to help out as much as she could, but Derek and the others told her to rest after her major abdominal surgery. While the others left, Cristina stayed behind to chat a little until she got paged. Though it was said at the meeting that the ER had to close, Meredith got confused when she witnessed Stephanie and Jo exchanging supplies to use in the ER. When a stressed Alex entered her room, Meredith managed to calm him down by letting him hold her son. He told her about Richard and Heather, and he gave the baby back to her so she herself could recover her own calm. Meanwhile, Cristina and Bailey started arguing over the course of treatment for Richard, only to find out that Richard had listed Meredith as his medical proxy, which in turn had forced her to choose between Cristina and Bailey's plans. She decided to do so by relying on science and asked to rerun some tests. While waiting for the results, Callie sat down in her room to have a little chat about how she was doing. When Richard's results came back, Meredith decided to side with Bailey and allowed her to operate, which Cristina had advised not to be done. While Bailey operated on Richard, Meredith asked Cristina to admit that the decision was right, and Cristina did.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith later talked with Cristina and Alex about Richard's decision to make her his medical proxy, wondering if she was in his will too. After Richard's surgery, Owen came to Meredith's room to tell her that Bailey had closed Richard back up once [[Catherine Fox|Catherine]] started yelling at them from the gallery. Meredith also consoled a sad Derek, who had lost Heather in surgery. After Meredith ordered Derek to go home with Zola, who had spent enough time in daycare now, Callie and Sofia came in to drop off some things. Callie told them that she had moved out of the apartment and that they would stay at a hotel for a while. Meredith decided to let Callie stay at their house, and she later told Arizona, who had no idea where Callie and Sofia were, that they were at her house. While trying to fall asleep, the interns bothered her to ask for help finding Heather stories to tell Heather's mother, and Meredith told them what she had told George's mother after he died. When the interns left, Jackson came in to tell her that his mother was planning on moving Richard to another hospital. Alex and April came in too to talk about their problems, and as they left one by one, they all refused to bring her a wheelchair. However, she somehow got herself a wheelchair and went to Richard's room in the ICU with Bailey. Bailey still thought that they should open him back up, and Meredith made the call to book an OR for Bailey. Later, back in her room, Cristina and Alex talked with Meredith about medical proxies, and it turned out that Cristina had actually disapproved of Meredith's decision for Richard. After Bailey's surgery, Catherine still wanted to have a second opinion. Meredith told her that Richard chose her to make his decisions, and not Catherine. They started arguing as Richard opened his eyes, and Meredith enthusiastically greeted him.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite his promise to Meredith to take care of the kids so that she could have a year to focus on her work, Derek started to consult on a time-consuming brain mapping project for the White House. The presidential team asked him to become more involved in the project, but he initially refused the offer in an attempt to keep his promise to Meredith. While at April and Matthew's wedding, Derek received a call from the president himself and ended up accepting the offer to put his name on their federal research initiative.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\nThis caused Meredith to become upset with him since she had wanted to continue with her own research work. Derek later learned that the federal team wanted him to run the project's advisory board. While on a trip to Washington, D.C., Derek was offered a full-time job at the National Institutes of Health, and he found a job for Meredith at James Madison Hospital.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Meredith later told Derek that she refused to leave Seattle after Cristina reminded her not to let what Derek wanted eclipse what she needed. Forced to choose between his family and the brain mapping job, Derek decided to stay in Seattle as well and rejected the offer.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, there was excessive tension between Meredith and Derek. Derek was unsatisfied with his job at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, especially because his sister Amelia had taken over as head of the neurosurgery department.\n\nMeredith was upset with Derek for being so attached to the federal initiative position and told him that she never wanted him to give it up for her. [[Deborah Curzon]], a special assistant to the president, came to Seattle in a last attempt to recruit Derek for their team. Derek told her that he was unfortunately unable to accept the offer, but he took her card anyway. Later that day, he got into a fight with Meredith, who told him to take the job in D.C. and leave. Derek called the woman he had spoken to earlier and told her that he did want the job after all.<ref>[[Risk]], x</ref>\n\nHe packed some clothes and went to the airport while Meredith threw away the Post-it note that had signified their marriage. The next day, Meredith and Derek talked on the phone and decided that they can make their relationship work, even if Derek had to take the job with the president. She then took the Post-it note out of the garbage and hung it back up on the wall. After a couple of weeks of Derek in D.C., he came home to Meredith and said that he thought D.C. was everything, but he was wrong. Derek told her that her, Zola and Bailey were everything. Derek told her that he couldn\ut live without her. Meredith replied that she could live without him but that she didn\ut ever want to. The two then hugged and made up. Derek moved back home.\n\nWhen Derek moved back home after being in D.C. the two were lying in bed and Derek told her that she was always the one. He told her that she truly did save him. He also told her that he wanted more with her. Meredith then went to work telling friends that she was happier than ever with her husband and children.\n\nWhen Derek was leaving to hand in his resignation to the White House, he told Meredith to stay and wait for him, just like when he left her at the house of candles so he could break up with Rose. Meredith and Derek kissed and he left. A couple of hours later, Meredith got a call that Derek never showed up for the meeting in Washington D.C.. Meredith soon began to worry about what happened to him. Just as she picked up the phone to call the police, the police came to the house asking if it was the home of Derek Shepherd. She replied yes that\us my husband. Meredith then was told there was an accident.\n\n\n[[File:Meredithsayinggoodbyetoderek.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith says her last goodbye to Derek.]]\nDerek was involved in a car accident with serious injuries. Ultimately, he was declared brain dead, and Meredith had his ventilators turned off. He had been on the way to the airport for a final trip to D.C. where he would wrap up his work and hand in his resignation. After Derek died, Meredith took Zola and Bailey and left Seattle in the middle of the night, much like her mother did with her when she was a child. All Meredith left was a note saying that she and the children were safe. Her friends tried to contact her repeatedly, but she didn't answer. It was later revealed that she moved to San Diego for one year. Finally, Meredith answered on Thanksgiving, telling Alex to stop calling her, that she and the kids were fine.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith put out feelers with a real estate agent to see whether anyone would be interested to buy her house. But she forgot to inform Amelia, which sparked a fight between the two. Amelia was mad at her for not having called her before pulling the plug on Derek, so she couldn't say goodbye. Meredith broke down after the confrontation. She later went to Alex and explained that her house didn't feel like her home without Derek, so she asked if she and the kids could stay with him and Jo for a while. He agreed to that,<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref> but Jo got mad at him for not consulting her first. Meredith felt guilty about forgetting that Amelia was also supposed to be her sister, and gave her her old phone with Derek's last voice mail message. Later that day, she intervened when Catherine and Richard were too angry to get married. Meredith played the dead husband card and got them to the altar after all. That evening, Meredith hosted a party for the newlyweds at her house. At the party, she told Maggie, who was upset about her own parents' divorce, that she could always come to talk to her, about anything. Amelia joined them as Meredith said that a house filled with happy people would be the perfect last memory, as that had been what Derek had wanted. She took Amelia and Maggie's hands and they went inside to dance it out together.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\nAs Jo found a loft for the two of them, Alex moved out of the house and sold it back to Meredith, who moved in with her kids and sisters. The sister started carpooling to work, and Meredith started to teach an intern anatomy class at the hospital. Initially, there were some tensions among Meredith and Amelia, including an argument over whether or not they were going to tear down the wall between the kitchen and the living room, as a drunk Meredith had mused about. Maggie intervened to call a truce. Meredith and Amelia apologized to each other, and Meredith admitted she doesn't know how to talk to Amelia as she's a lot to handle sometimes, and Meredith doesn't totally like her. However, she considered Amelia family, so she didn't have to. She then decided it was okay to tear the wall down.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a busy day where Bailey, the new Chief, dumped all her patients on Meredith, Bailey rewarded Meredith with a promotion to Head of General Surgery.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref> However, Bailey made Meredith an offer with a low salary. After consulting with other department heads, Meredith stood up for herself and asked for the salary she deemed fit. It turned out that Bailey was actually testing her to see if she would stand up for herself and agreed to Meredith's request.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen [[Nathan Riggs]] arrived at the hospital, it did not take long for Meredith to discover the reasons regarding his feud with Owen. Out of loyalty, Meredith asked Owen if they hated Nathan, to which Owen said yes.\n\nThe day Owen sold Derek's trailer, Meredith witnessed Amelia being happy in her new life with Derek's job and a possible engagement to Cristina's former husband. This all resulted in a particularly bad day for Meredith, resulting in her snapping at everyone in the OR, including Nathan. Alex later told her not to crap on everyone's life just because she was choosing to be unhappy and pointed out she had choices. Later that night in the parking lot, Nathan brought up her behavior and that he understood the way she felt about living a life without Derek, comparing it to Megan's disappearance. Things got heated and resulted in her kissing him, which led to them hooking up in her car four times in one night.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Owen and Amelia's wedding, Meredith and Alex talked about possibly having only one true love in your life. At work, Meredith made it clear to Nathan that she didn't want him to get too attached, which he assured her he wasn't.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie confesses her crush on Nathan.]]\nShe then went to the church to get Amelia down the aisle, which included a quick getaway and more debating about having one true love. Meredith concluded it would be better if you believed you can have more than one. This led her to open up to Nathan shortly before the ceremony when they discussed her wedding and his wedding plans with Megan. During the ceremony, Nathan gave Meredith a loving look. However, Maggie misinterpreted his look as being for her, and she confessed to Meredith that she had a crush on Nathan, leaving Meredith in an awkward situation.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nAt the wedding reception, Nathan invited her to dance but she declined. As he was suggesting they get out together, Maggie interrupted and ended up dancing with Nathan. Meredith continued to avoid Nathan after Maggie's confession and told him they had a problem. Before she could elaborate, Jo called her about Alex assaulting Andrew. She went to the hospital to check on Andrew's status and, knowing what really happened, kept Alex updated on Andrew while lying to Maggie about what had happened to Andrew. She and Ben both knew that Alex was the culprit, but she kept protecting Alex to make sure his good side would win. She learned the truth about DeLuca being with Jo through Stephanie and went to tell Alex, who had thought that DeLuca was raping a drunk Jo. She advised Alex to go and tell Bailey what happened, but he went to try and stop Andrew from pressing charges.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Nathan supports Meredith.]]\nNathan found her sitting in a lounge and sat with her at her request as she decided to tell Bailey the truth. She did so, but Alex turned himself in before Bailey could have him arrested. Maggie was upset when she learned that Meredith had lied to her. Meredith said she just did so because they were still figuring things out and promised not to lie to her anymore, like a real sister. However, she immediately broke that promise when she hid the fact that Nathan came to see her that night, asking about the problem she had mentioned as he really felt something between them. She replied someone would get hurt and, since Nathan brushed it off, then lied and said she didn't feel the same way about him.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie later told her about her recurring sexual dreams about Nathan and decided to ask him out like a grown woman ready for her big love. Meredith then accompanied Alex to the courthouse, where he was charged with felony assault in the second degree. This made Alex think of himself as just another piece of trash but Meredith reminded him of his career and remained confident that he wouldn't go to prison. In surgery with Maggie, Owen came in to invite Meredith for a housewarming, and Maggie volunteered to come after finding out Nathan would be there. Meredith later rode an elevator with Andrew and talked about how she was assaulted and forgave the man who did that to her. She added he should be focused on surgery instead of the case, which he interpreted as a threat.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith at the dinner party.]]\nMeredith arrived at the dinner party and she made Owen give Maggie a tour so she could have a private talk with Nathan. She told him Maggie was going to ask him out and she asked Nathan to decline nicely, which Nathan took as a signal that Meredith herself felt something for him, which she denied. At the party, she also asked Jo to talk to Alex even though Jo was more concerned about Andrew. Later at the hospital, Bailey confronted Meredith about her threat to Andrew and warned Meredith not to go down with Alex, but Meredith insisted on standing by him. She and Bailey then had to operate on Alex's patient following a mistake he made, and Meredith invited Andrew to scrub in to clear the air between them. Back at home, Alex told Meredith about Bailey's decision to let him work in the clinic and that he supported that decision because his head wasn't in the game. Meredith then told him about her sleeping with Nathan, just before Maggie came in and told them Nathan turned her down. However, she didn't plan on giving up since he just told her he wasn't dating right now.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey and Catherine brought [[Eliza Minnick]] to be the new Residency Program Director, effectively firing Richard from the job. When Meredith refused to allow Eliza into her OR to observe her teaching technique, Bailey suspended her. Bailey came to her house to get her to come back to her job. She agreed to come back if Richard could return to the Residency Program Director. Bailey declined and Meredith didn't come to work. Richard came over to Meredith's house to get her to come back and said she'd be fine.\n\n\nEventually, Meredith finally agreed to dinner with Nathan, but their plans were postponed when Maggie's mother died and Meredith had to take care of her.<ref>[[Be Still, My Soul]], x</ref> She found herself on an airplane with Nathan, as both were heading to a conference. They ended up hooking up in the airplane bathroom. Both had to tend to patients when the plane hit turbulence. The experience allowed them both to become closer and for Meredith to open up to Nathan about her history. She agreed to stay in a hotel room with Nathan, marking another step in their relationship.<ref>[[In the Air Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs the relationship with Nathan progressed to him sleeping over a lot, Meredith finally found it time for him to meet the kids and invited him to dinner. After doing so, she started to panic a bit, but Amelia pointed out there was nothing or no one standing in her way. However, as she came home after work and told her kids about the upcoming guest, her plans were thwarted when Amelia told her that Megan had been found and was on her way to Seattle. Upon finding out that Nathan didn't know yet, Meredith immediately left to go and tell him. As she arrived at the hospital, she witnessed an explosion from the parking lot.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> Meredith rushed inside and started to help out with evacuating patients due to the spreading fire, all the while looking for Nathan. She also went looking for [[Erin Miller]], a missing girl. While looking for Erin on the OR floor, she found that Nathan had refused to evacuate and was still working on his lobectomy patient. She quickly got gowned and gloved to help him so they'd be out faster. As soon as they could, they left and took the patient to the evac zone outside. He had inhaled some smoke and needed oxygen therapy. Meredith stayed with him and checked his breath sounds. In that quiet moment, she recalled their shared dream of their lost loved one returning to them and finally told him the news about Megan. He broke down and she confronted him, unable to answer his questions about Megan. She could only tell him that Megan would be brought to Madigan Medical Center. He decided to drive up there and could hardly contain his excitement and happiness, something she told him he did not need to apologize for as she understood how he felt. She then told him to get going and watched him drive off.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith talks to Megan before the surgery.]]\nMeredith was at work when Owen and Nathan brought Megan to the hospital. She had a frozen abdomen and Meredith had an idea of how they could reverse her colostomy. While Bailey and Webber advised a conservative approach, but Megan opted for the more radical approach so she could return to her son in Iraq faster. Nathan had doubts about Meredith working on the case given their history, but Meredith assured him she could do it. Megan tried to find out from her who Nathan had been dating, but Meredith didn't answer. [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] also urged her to tell Megan the full story. As she advised Alex to tell Jo that he had found her husband, she realized it was only right Megan also got the full story and went to tell her, only moments before Nathan came in to do so. As she prepped Megan for surgery, she shared that her one great love had died and that she'd do everything to get Megan back to her son, which was Megan's first priority. Meredith nervously scrubbed in for the surgery, which went well right up to the end, when she found out there wasn't enough tissue left to close the wound, angering her.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nShe took her anger out by destroying the attending's lounge and went home, where she was inspired to perform an abdominal wall transplant. She got Teddy on her side and they presented the plan to Megan, who accepted the opportunity to escape her hospital bed and didn't have a problem with Meredith doing the surgery. She had Richard's sub-interns set out to find a donor since UNOS had none available. When she received news they had found one, she went to tell Megan, accidentally interrupting Nathan's proposing to her. Meredith, Teddy, and Jo then performed the surgery without a hitch. Megan recovered well. On her way out, Meredith found Nathan sitting outside on a bench. He told her Megan was still convinced he was in love with Meredith, who was angered and walked off.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\nMeredith did not want to be in another love triangle and believed that Nathan was betraying her by not seizing the miraculous opportunity to be with Megan again. Eventually, with all of Meredith's pushing, Nathan started a new life with Megan in Los Angeles with her son, [[Farouk Shami Hunt|Farouk]].\n\nBecause of her groundbreaking procedure on Megan, Meredith landed the cover of the Journal of Surgical Advancement (JSA) and won a [[Catherine Fox Award]]. She also began a series of ALPPS procedures - a first for any doctor on the West Coast.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref> For Jackson's surgery competition, she submitted a proposal for a mini-liver procedure but was unable to get the patent from her mother's former friend, [[Marie Cerone]], who still held a grudge over her and Ellis' fight. Eventually, Meredith was able to develop the procedure with the help of Jo. She also later broke the hospital's record for the single longest surgery.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith starts treating matchmaker Cece.]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew kissed Meredith while drunk, which he immediately apologized for. While she dismissed at as no big deal, the kiss led to her having sex dreams about the majority of men in her life, such as Andrew, Jackson, and Tom. Soon after, she started treating [[Cece Colvin]], a professional matchmaker, who picked up on Meredith's desire to be kissed, even though Meredith dismissed the observation. She threw her hat in the ring for the recent job opening for interim Chief to have extra work to distract her from her desires. Cece had to be put on dialysis awaiting her kidney transplant. Throughout the set-up, she pointed out that there's no cap on happiness and that love doesn't just come walking through the door. After the surgery, Meredith briefly met [[Atticus Lincoln]] but dismissed him at his attempt to introduce himself. At night in bed, a curious Meredith googled Cece's services but opted against using them.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nWhile the sex dreams continued, Meredith found herself avoiding Cece due to her aggressive matchmaking attempts. Jackson advised her to tell Cece she was married to her work, which she heavily objected to, causing Link to overhear that she wasn't married. In another attempt to find more work, Meredith set out to convince Bailey to allow her to create a surgical innovation fellowship for Jo. Later, she ran into Link and he properly introduced himself. She defended her earlier comment and stated she just meant she had a life outside work. He proposed drinks after work, but she had to assist Maggie in inserting a pacemaker for Cece's heart. During the procedure, Maggie also encouraged her to hire Cece. They later had to inform her that her client, whom she had hit after passing out in her car, had died, Cece opposed being put on the transplant list. Bailey then found Meredith and told her she had stolen Meredith's idea and created the fellowship for Jo under her own leadership. She needed some joy and found that was the way to do it, so she told Meredith to go find joy herself. After finding out she had been passed over as interim Chief, which went to Alex instead, Meredith decided to hire Cece. She admitted to Cece that she was, in fact, married to her work but didn't want to be. Having found a new purpose, Cece accepted her as a client and they started talking.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nAfterward, Meredith got tired of the flood of questions soon and did her best to avoid them. Cece tried to get answers through [[Taryn Helm]], but Meredith only closed herself off even more. She confided in Alex, who told her that after everything she had been through, she had earned the right to close herself off and be selective of whom she wanted to let it. While Meredith found a new way to continue Cece's care, she and Cece agreed to diminish the number of questions and try a new approach as well. She instructed Meredith to go out and buy herself five new outfits and ready herself for something new, which she did.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nCece planned a blind date for Meredith, who briefly came into work beforehand wearing make-up, which was noticed by several men, including Andrew and Link. She met with the guy at a restaurant for lunch having low expectations, but they really hit it off and [[John (Character)|John]] completely understood her dedication to her work. Along the way, they discovered they were actually on the wrong date but decided to keep it going. They left the restaurant and took a stroll. While discussing traveling, John stated that he was happy not having kids that could restrict his travel plans. He even went on to say he hated how desperate single mothers are in the dating scene. Having lost all interest due to his comment, Meredith revealed she had three children of her own and left the date.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andy makes Meredith realize there are positive things to take away from her date.]]\nAt the hospital, she shared her experience with [[Andy Herrera]], who made her see that she now knew there still were great men out there and that she managed to dodge this particular slow-moving bullet because he revealed his opinion on single mothers before the relationship could have dragged on for too long.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nThe blind dates continued. Before a date with [[Daniel (Flowers Grow Out of My Grave)|Daniel]], Meredith was told by Richard that [[Thatcher Grey|her father]] was dying of acute myeloid leukemia. She didn't know what to do about the situation. Link approached her for dinner, but she turned him down as she viewed him as more of an emergency kind of person rather than serious dating potential. In surgery, she and Alex discussed her situation with her father. She opened the door by giving him a piece of her liver, but he never walked through. She wouldn't need to grieve him since he had been a ghost for years. On her date, Meredith rambled on about how it shouldn't be children's job to forgive their parents just because they are their parents. She decided not to reach out since the sole purpose would be making Thatcher feel better, which she didn't think weighed up against the pain it would cause her and her kids. She returned to the hospital, where Link put his number in her phone in case of an emergency. At the same time, Andrew came over to ask Meredith about her date. She said she scared him off. Both Link and Andrew then held the elevator doors for her, causing her to take the stairs. After work, she went to hang at Alex and Jo's with Link, whose hair she cut after he had cut off a piece to comfort a kid facing cancer treatment.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was flown out to Los Angeles with [[Tom Koracick]] by [[Catherine Fox]], who needed their expertise. She revealed she had a spinal tumor. They did extra tests and found it was a grade III chondrosarcoma. Catherine struggled with how to tell Richard. Unbeknownst to her, Meredith received a call from Richard to tell her he had been arrested and was in jail.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Seattle, Meredith bailed out Richard as a windstorm hit Seattle. Back at the hospital, she and Andrew treated a deteriorating Cece, who had discovered Link and suggested him to Meredith. Concerned over Catherine's health, Meredith was dismissive of Maggie's relationship troubles with Jackson. Meredith eventually broke HIPAA and told Maggie about Catherine's cancer. At the same time, Taryn arrived with the news that they had finally found a donor for Cece. Andrew clarified to Cece that there was a very real chance she would not make it off the table alive, but Cece was willing to roll the dice. She did warn Meredith she would come back to haunt her if she didn't do her best to squeeze all possible joy out of her life. This convinced Meredith to say yes to drinks with Link, much to Andrew's dismay. He then sought out Meredith as she was preparing for the transplant and told her that he had fallen in love with her since their kiss and that he wanted her to know that he was an option. While she had some excuses to turn him away, such as her being his attending and his history with Maggie, he thought she felt the attraction between them, too. Overcome by desire, she removed herself from the situation and promised him she'd think about what he had said. Soon after, they got stuck together in an elevator on their way to the OR due to a power outage caused by the storm.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith bond while stuck in an elevator.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith decides not to choose between the two men pursuing her just yet.]]\nWith no cell phone connection, they tried to find a way out to no avail. She asked him to stop looking at her the way he did. He likened their situation to Doctor Who's TARDIS, where the rules don't apply, but she told him the rules still applied. While in there, Andrew confided in her about how his famous surgeon father killed four people while he operated in a manic episode but he got away with it because of his connections. Meredith then decided to try the trap door and he lifted her up but to no avail. As he lowered her down, she dropped into his arms and they almost shared a kiss until the power kicked back in. Finally free, they rushed to the OR. Unfortunately, Cece didn't make it. Meredith closed her up and told her about her interest in both Link and Andrew. Thanks to Cece, she had found happiness again. Afterward, Andrew showed some of his appealing cocky side and asked Meredith out on a date, with Link coming over at the exact moment with the same question. Unable to choose, she decided to go home to her children.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nThe attraction between Meredith and Andrew continued to grow with every surgery did they together. At the same time, she found herself irritated by Link's laid-back attitude. She questioned why Jo ever thought they would be good together and didn't try to hide her disdain from Link. A difference of opinion over a shared patient led to a confrontation in the OR. She wondered why he had kept his reasoning for his non-standard approach from her, to which he replied that convincing her that he belonged here was not a part of his job.\n\nLater, he found out that The Hulk had canceled for [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey's]] superhero birthday party. He offered to help out and they managed to get her house ready in time. He explained he offered to help out because she seemed stressed. He shared he does not believe in letting stress ruin your life after half of his hospital friends died from a cancer he survived and because his parents split up over it. Finally understanding the origins of his laid-back nature, she apologized for the way she behaved. He didn't mind as he liked the chase. The kids then arrived for the party and Link played along with Bailey. They sat down with cake and wine and he complimented her on running a three-kid household all the while winning surgical awards. As she admitted she had grown to like him more over the course of the day, they continued to talk over cake and wine while she ignored Andrew's text asking her to come over to celebrate his first solo surgery.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith reconnects with her dying father.]]\nFollowing Richard's urging, Meredith decided she did want to say goodbye to her father before it was too late. She went to visit him and discovered he had moved to Zimbabwe after Lexie's death. The realization he had yet again left her behind hurt her deeply, but he revealed he had actually come back for Derek's funeral. However, he saw how lost she was and decided not to bother her any further one of the most difficult days of her life. Conversation then came easier and Meredith told him about Maggie and her children and comforted him until he died with her by his side.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Jo and Alex invited Meredith for their classy NYE party. Andrew came over to ask Meredith out for drinks. She declined as she had to go put her kids to bed, but she did invite him to come to the party with her. Link, dressed as Santa, came over to give Meredith cookies from his bag while on his way to the peds ward. Jo mocked Meredith's love triangle, but Meredith stated there was no love and thus no triangle. Afterward, Andrew asked Meredith when she was going to stop stringing Link along as he was growing tired of wasting time not being with her. She assured him NYE was an actual date between them. However, she stayed at the hospital, thus standing up both Link and Andrew at the party.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew confronts Meredith about her behavior.]]\nLater at work, Andrew confronted Meredith over her standing him up and stated it was just rude of her. As time went on, he witnessed her convincing her patient's husband not to give up, he wondered how she could tell the man that if she herself kept running away from love. He thought she was so beyond him, but it turns out she was just a kid hiding behind excuses. To spite him, Meredith turned around and asked Link out to dinner. He was surprised since it was Valentine's Day but gladly accepted. Later that day, Meredith officiated a wedding between her patient and her fianc\ue shortly before the former's death. Afterward, Andrew took Meredith to the hospital roof for a spontaneous date with champagne. She stayed with him and they ended up sharing their first kiss while Link waited for her at the restaurant.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith apologized to Link for standing him up. She also held off on going on a real date with Andrew because she wanted to make sure Maggie was okay with it. While awaiting the date, Andrew kept staring at her longingly so Meredith set a rule that he could not do that at work so at to not be distracted from her work. After successfully operating on [[Kimberly Thompson|a woman from Maggie's past]] together, Maggie was finally ready to hear her out. While surprised, she was fine with it, so Meredith then went to find Andrew and took him out on a date to a restaurant. He agreed but insisted it'd be his treat.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew lets Meredith sleep.]]\nFollowing their date, Andrew assisted her as she broke the hospital's longest surgery record with a  hour and -minute surgery. Afterward, an exhausted Meredith fell asleep on a gurney in a hallway, so Andrew moved her to a bed in an empty room and covered her with a blanket.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith plan to leave soon for a night to themselves.]]\nOn the day of Jackson's party to celebrate Catherine surviving her surgery, Meredith told Chief Karev about her relationship with Andrew. He mocked her and also told her to report it to HR. She took Andrew to the party with her as her plus one, though they did not plan on staying long as Meredith had the house to herself. However, their plans were disrupted when Amelia had a fight with Owen and planned on sleeping at the house. Andrew then took Meredith into a guest room at Jackson's and they started making out there, only to be caught by Richard. To calm herself and \"act normal\", Meredith took Andrew into the kitchen and took over preparing egg rolls from the catering staff, inadvertently putting a plastic tray in the oven, which led to the penthouse being evacuated right before the big celebratory speech. Andrew and Meredith then decided to go to his place, but their plans were once again disrupted, this time by the return of [[Carina DeLuca]] with [[Vincenzo DeLuca]], Andrew's father.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew asks Meredith to trust his judgment on his father.]]\nVincenzo came to Seattle to pitch research on gestational sacks, while Meredith had a dream about her mother that steered her towards finding a specific new research project, though she had yet to figure out what exactly it was. While she spent the day in a lab trying to find an answer, Andrew visited and told her that his father seemed stable despite Carina's claims that he was bipolar. At the same time, Maggie publicly revealed her biological parentage to the medical community, which Meredith was fine with. Meredith talked about Vincenzo with Alex and advised him to dig deeper before agreeing to fund the research, but hid her knowledge about his mental illness so as to not break Andrew's trust. She later came across the arguing DeLuca siblings in a hallway. Carina wanted to shut the research down, but Andrew had signed on, insisting their father was stable. While Meredith herself remained on the fence, Andrew asked her to trust his judgment on this. At the end of the day, Meredith concluded her research had to be about non-invasive diagnostic tools.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew spent all his time on his father's research while Meredith gave him the space to do so. While her bad feeling about the project persisted, she decided to just be supportive of Andrew. In the end, Vincenzo's display of reckless behavior led to Alex shutting the research down. Meredith found Andrew clearing out the lab and he requested some time alone, so she told him to let her know if he needed anything and left him be.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith works on her research while Andrew ignores her.]]\nAndrew continued to shut Meredith out, so she focused her time and energy on her ingestible diagnostic device research. He later sent her a text to come over, which she did. She told him she was past the point in her life where she would sit around at work wondering if her boyfriend was ignoring her. He knew that, but he just needed some time to be hurt over his father and he did not want to drag her down with him. To make up for his behavior, he made her an apology dinner.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith assisted Jackson, Catherine, Owen, and [[Megan Hunt]] on a complex surgery involving an abdominal wall transplant and a penis and scrotum transplant, Richard gave Andrew a solo lap appy under his supervision. Meredith spent the day worrying about Andrew, but he passed Richard's test with flying colors despite the surgery turning into a complicated procedure. Richard told her that Andrew was a good man and Andrew later talked her through his day over dinner at his place.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nThe relationship continued to evolve but Meredith never let him sleep over since she didn't want her kids to meet him before she had told them about him. However, one night, Andrew ran into Zola while sneaking out, thus disrupting Meredith's plan on how to tell her kids. At work, Meredith and Andrew's patient turned out to be in labor instead of having an obstruction. Meredith asked Bailey for advice on how to tell her kids. After watching Andrew take care of the newborn baby, Meredith decided to gather her kids that night. Over ice cream, she told them that Andrew was her boyfriend and that he would be visiting more, but that she was not going anywhere, following Bailey's advice.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith's happy life continued for a short while until she joined Alex and Andrew on [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabriella Rivera's]] case. Gabby and her mother had been detained at the Mexican border. Gabby was reunited with her father after three months while her mother was still in the detention center. Since she was given little to no medical care, Luis had no clue what was going on with her. A scan revealed an obstruction that eventually led to her needing surgery. Unable to pay for it, Luis applied for state coverage but he earned too much cleaning office buildings to qualify. With Gabby's condition worsening, Meredith promised she had a plan. She secretly put her daughter Ellis's name on the paperwork, which alarmed Richard. He yelled at her for what she did, but she insisted that the system was broken and that they could debate her actions later. She then headed into surgery. Pathology revealed that the obstruction was caused by lymphoma, meaning they were looking at years of treatment and follow-up.\n\nAfter the surgery, Richard pointed out that Meredith was risking losing her license and a prison sentence for committing a felony and that implicating Luis in insurance fraud wouldn't help his asylum. He then suggested that they make Gabby sicker on paper so they could keep her in the hospital for  days, after which a new state policy would automatically kick in regardless of Luis' income. They rolled with it and assured Luis he could sleep in Gabby's room every night so they would not have to be separated again. Meredith assumed that Andrew was judging her for her actions, but he revealed he was actually in awe of her and hadn't spoken out because he was afraid he would tell her that he loved her. Taken by surprise, Meredith barely responded to his confession and left.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nUpon finding out that Jo still hadn't spoken to Alex after her return from Pittsburgh, Meredith went to stay with Jo while Alex took her place in her household. Jo shut her out and said Meredith was only there to hide from her own life. Meredith admitted that Andrew's \"I love you\" terrified her because it reminded her of Derek and all the pain she had been through. She then said she understood pain from deep experience and that her parents had messed with her head, like Alex's had, so they would both understand whatever had happened in Pittsburgh. Jo then revealed that her mother was raped by her father and that she looked like him. Jo then opened up about how all the terrible things in her life were just her birthright, but Meredith quipped with good things that Jo had been a part of. To get through to her, Meredith talked about how she stopped fighting when she was about to drown and asked if Jo wanted to stop fighting, too, or if she just needed a few more days under her covers. Jo replied the latter, after which Meredith insisted they go talk to Alex and Bailey to get her a proper leave of absence so she could get the help she needed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Trapped, Meredith fails to stop Andrew from taking the fall for her.]]\nWhile Jo waited to talk to Bailey, she asked Meredith to go and tell Alex. Meredith joined him in the hyperbaric chamber with [[Gus Carter]], while unbeknownst to her, her insurance fraud had come to light and Andrew was being questioned by Bailey, Catherine, and representatives from the insurance company. Soon after, Andrew came by with Catherine to say goodbye; he claimed that he had committed the fraud and apologized to her. Meredith wanted to stop him from taking the fall, but she couldn't stop him from taking the fall and turning himself in as she could not leave the chamber.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nUnwilling to explain the whole situation to the technicians through the phone to stop Andrew, Meredith had no choice but to focus on Gus and Alex. She told him about Jo's depression and what had caused it. After finding out about what Andrew did, Richard dropped by. Meredith asked him to set the record straight as Andrew's career would not survive this. He pointed out her children wouldn't recover if she were locked up, but she planned on hiring a great lawyer and plead her case, confident that her track record and the fact that it was her first offense would help her win. As Gus coded, the decompression process was started. She and Alex pulled Gus through and she rushed off.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith informs Bailey and Catherine on what she did.]]\nShe went to set the record straight with Bailey and Catherine. Alex and Richard came to her defense, but Bailey fired all three of them. Having made her mind up, Meredith went home to tell her kids that she would have to leave for a while to go take care of something. She then went to visit Andrew in jail and told him he needed to let her clean up her own messes and develop some self-preservation skills. She stood by her decision. She told him she loved him and left to set the record straight.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nShe immediately went to her attorney. Much to her surprise, she was told that she could go home. The lawyer would schedule a hearing, where she suspected Meredith would be ordered to a few hours of community service in a clinic if she was repentant. Additionally, she deemed it highly unlikely that the medical board would pursue action her license. A week later, the hearing took place and Meredith explained to the judge that Gabriela's cancer meant too many procedures and money to pay for herself or cover it pro bono. She stated the system should have supported the Riveras and that it was broken. She honestly said she only regretted her decisions to the extent she could knowing that they led to Gabriela doing well now. The judge got angry and the lawyer blurted out her three kids as a reason to keep her out of jail. She was then ordered to community service but picking up trash on the streets instead of at a clinic.\n\nWhile picking up trash, she started to give out medical advice when other people in her group found out she was a doctor. After a few weeks, Suzie Wilson, Zola's classroom mom, passed by and recognized her. Thinking she was volunteering, Suzie said she finally understood why Meredith never volunteered at school. Meredith explained working mothers don't have time for that, after which her supervisor shouted at her, revealing that she was actually there per court order. Suzie spread the word at school, which was overheard by Zola, who come home to ask her how to spell criminal. While enjoying some ice cream with Andrew, Meredith told him she was happy both she and the kids were healthy and that she actually found some sense of accomplishment in picking up trash. She then received a letter from the medical board to inform her they were, in fact, pursuing action against her license.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShe started disguising herself better to avoid getting recognized again. One morning, she found out her hearing about her license was scheduled three months later. Taking advantage of still having her license, she continued to give out medical advice to people on her crew, referring them to Pac-North for further care. She also had Levi bring her supplies from Grey Sloan, which she thought of as hers since she still owned the hospital. Her supervisor [[Robin (Season )|Robin]] started to object to her street clinic since it was keeping people from doing their work but Meredith brought up she had noticed a nodule in Robin's neck that warranted a closer look. Robin had seen her primary care physician about it, who referred her to an ENT, but her appointment was still months away. After convincing her that detecting possible cancer was more important than staying at work for two more hours, Meredith took her to the Grey Sloan parking lot for an ultrasound. Given the features shown on there, she convinced Jackson to take the time to perform a biopsy, which revealed papillary thyroid cancer, which could be treated. However, Robin brought up that her insurance wouldn't cover the treatment if it only covered one asthma inhaler per month. Jackson said they would look into options for her, which Robin said would boil down to bankruptcy or death. Meredith was then discovered in the hospital by Bailey but she stated she was just visiting a friend. That night at home, Meredith shared that continuously seeing people being let down by the medical system had made her decide to write about what she was seeing despite her lawyer advising her to lay low.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nShe got in touch with a website that would publish her story and shared some titles she had thought of with Andrew, all of them insulting to the medical system. She didn't care about her standing with the medical community since they were in a fight already anyway. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Meredith's patient [[Shirley Gregory]] was refusing to let Jo operate on her despite her being a student of Meredith's. Jo then had Bailey agree to have Meredith supervise the procedure remotely through video chat, which convinced Shirley to consent. Meredith used Robin owing her to follow the entire procedure through but Bailey hung up on her as soon as the procedure was over, leaving Meredith to go take care of a beehive in a discarded toilet. Link and Amelia came over to hang out with her and Andrew at the house. Amelia shared she was pregnant. Meredith congratulated her, excited about becoming an aunt.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWithout her knowledge, the website combined all her suggested topics into one article entitled \"Hospital Hell at Grey Sloan Memorial: Fired Surgeon Speaks Out.\" Including sharp comments about insurance companies, Big Pharma, and institutionalized discrimination, the article started trending online. She realized the article would terrify people and keep patients away from Grey Sloan. She also figured Bailey would hate her even more, which Andrew confirmed as soon as he got to work. Meredith attempted to set the record straight with the website but they refused to delete the article or even change the headline because of the popularity it had gained. Meredith quickly finished her assigned zone at community service and asked her [[Supervisor Lisa|supervisor]] to be allowed to leave to take care of an emergency. Her supervisor told her that she would inform the judge of all her extracurriculars if she left before putting in the required hours. After Meredith learned even Cristina had learned about the article, she promised Lisa she would make up the hours and begged her not to call the judge, after which she took off. At the hospital, after Jo confirmed that Bailey was furious at her, Meredith went to see her and told her that she had nothing to do with the article as all the things she had written herself were not directed at the hospital. She offered to write a retraction but Bailey said they never get read. Meredith stressed she loved the hospital and how sorry she was but Bailey said the damage had been done and asked her to leave.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith defends her choices to Andrew.]]\nOn her way out, she ran into Andrew and told him what had gone down and that she had gotten a summons to go back to court because she had walked out on community service. Andrew hated that she made a choice that could land her in jail and added to the possibility of her losing her license. He wished she would have done the community service and come back to work to change the system from within, but she said nothing she had written was untrue and that she wasn't going to sit on her mountain of privilege leaving others to fight for themselves in the broken system that was hurting and killing them. She added that if he really expected her to sit back and nothing, he didn't know her at all, and walked away from him.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nHer skipping out on community service gave her nightmares. On the day of her court hearing, she woke up to Zola telling her she wasn't feeling well. When Zola vomited during breakfast, a worried Meredith took her to the hospital and asked Tom for a head CT given Zola's history of spina bifida. While waiting for the CT, her lawyer reminded her she needed to be in court but the scans revealed Zola's shunt needed to be revised. Andrew tried to convince her to go to court while he'd look out for Zola but Meredith made it clear there was no way she would leave her daughter. Tom made Meredith wait in the waiting area so she made Taryn promise to text her updates. Andrew offered to sit with her but she didn't like him offering to skip a surgery to be her human tissue. Maggie and Amelia came to sit with her and Meredith vented her frustration about Andrew, who just didn't get her because he wasn't a parent himself. She said Andrew was sexy and fun but she wasn't sure if he was more than that or if she even wanted him to be. She then asked Maggie and Amelia to talk about their lives to distract her. Meredith grew increasingly worried despite Taryn's reassuring texts. As she was about to head to the OR, Zola's surgical team came by to tell everything had gone fine. Meredith ordered Andrew to stay by Zola's side in post-op. Later that night, Meredith headed out to get Zola some Jello. She ran into Andrew, who had anticipated the request and had found her a cup. Her lawyer then appeared and Meredith explained why she hadn't shown up for the hearing. Nancy told her she squeezed a drop of humanity out of the judge, which meant she'd have to make up the lost hours in jail.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith went to jail. On Halloween, she woke up with her roommate [[Paula (Season )|Paula]] hovering over her face because Meredith had been snoring. Since she was supposed to be let out that day and was eager to spend the holiday with her kids, Meredith watched the clock closely. When the time came, she addressed a guard, who told her that, as per usual, a crucial document for her release hadn't arrived one time but that it would show up soon. Meredith tried to bribe the guard by offering medical advice to any sick family members but it didn't work. Paula then learned she was a doctor and wondered what she did to end up in jail. Meredith told her about her crime, which was still threatening her medical license. Paula wasn't impressed with her small problems and told her how she had landed there. She was still waiting for her hearing but couldn't post bail so she was stuck in jail until the hearing, which would most likely be another month. Meanwhile, her kids were placed in the foster system. Meredith helped her out with a puzzle and commented that she was strong for not letting herself go crazy with worry over her kids. The guard came to let Meredith out and they wished each other good luck. The officer told Meredith to keep fighting the good fight without landing herself in jail. Meredith then asked the man for a favor. She went home and greeted her kids. She told her sisters she had come to realize she had a lot to work with even if she were to lose her license. She then called her lawyer and made arrangements to pay Paula's bail so she could be reunited with her kids.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nHaving made up for the hours, Meredith went back to doing community service. She ran into Amelia on her way out one day and advised her to tell Owen about the pregnancy. Meredith was working near Pac-North and decided to have coffee with Alex during her break. While in line at the coffee cart, she ran into Amelia and Maggie who told her about their problems.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of her hearing, Meredith drove to the hotel with her sisters, Alex, and Andrew. While waiting to enter the room of the hearing, Meredith waited with most of Grey Sloan's attendings, including Bailey. Upon entering the room, Nancy asked Meredith to keep quiet for once given the vicious prosecutor and let her do her job. Meredith promised she would.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith learns Paul Castello is on the panel.]]\nThe hearing began and the judge introduced the doctors on the panel. [[Paul Castello]] came in late and Meredith immediately recognized him as the doctor who had killed Derek, while he didn't seem to remember her at all. Meredith quietly explained the situation to Nancy but upon learning that the hearing would have to be rescheduled, which could take six months, Meredith decided to power through with Paul on the panel. Bailey took the stand first and denied Nancy's suggestions of her and Meredith being close. She stated Meredith no longer held the qualities that had prompted Bailey to appoint her Head of General Surgery. Afterward, the prosecutor presented her with a list of questionable events Meredith had been involved in, all of which Bailey confirmed to be true. Afterward, Luis Rivera testified that Meredith had saved his daughter and that there should be more doctors like her. Andrew was mostly questioned about their relationship, which he assured them was completely consensual and that Meredith had not pressured him to keep the fraud quiet when he discovered it. He was also confronted with his request for a transfer, which detailed Meredith's and other attendings' abuse of him after he pressed charges against Alex for assaulting him. Andrew assured the panel that that had been cleared up and left in the past. He apologized to Meredith, who said it was okay. Levi began testifying about Meredith being an amazing teacher but he was soon forced to confess that he had been the one who had reported the fraud to Bailey. He broke down and ran out after his testimony. During the recess that followed, Meredith told Andrew that their relationship wouldn't survive if her license were taken away.\n\nAfter the recess, Owen testified to her surgical skills, specifically on Megan's case, but the prosecutor had dug up Bailey's post-op notes, which mentioned Owen voicing serious doubts about Meredith's approach at the time. Richard was questioned about the Alzheimer trial but he maintained that he was the only one who had played a role in that. The prosecutor commented on the pattern of his bending the rules for Meredith and called [[Patricia Murphy]] to the stand. She shared that Meredith hadn't been matched to Seattle Grace at first until Richard reached out to the NRMP to make a personal recommendation, which landed Meredith her spot. Meredith was shocked upon hearing this. Alex testified about Meredith making him a better person and surgeon. He was asked about the delay in Zola's adoption. He kept her kidnapping of Zola quiet and said delays happen all the time. The prosecutor suspected it had something to do with Meredith's being fired. Alex hesitated to answer. Paul then began pressing him to answer, asking if Meredith's insubordinate behavior had almost cost her her daughter. Meredith shot up and told him that he had no right to talk about her daughter as he had been the one to kill her father as he neglected to do even basic burr holes, let alone a head CT. Meredith yelled that he didn't deserve to judge her or anyone for that matter, after which he had a sudden seizure. She was among the doctors who rushed to his aid. She briefed the paramedics when they arrived and stressed that they should get him a head CT. \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Gabby is among the patients who showed up to show their support for Meredith.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey re-hires Meredith to work at Grey Sloan.]]\nAfter another recess, the judge announced that the hearing would be postponed given the situation. Alex, however, objected and let in a large group of people, all of whom had been treated by Meredith. [[Ray Ford]], [[Shirley Gregory]], [[Robin (Season )|Robin]], and [[Katie Bryce]] all testified that Meredith had saved their lives. Alex then read a letter from Cristina, which stated that taking Meredith's license meant signing death certificates of countless future patients and that Meredith was an unstoppable light in a broken system. Alex wanted to proceed with letters from Callie, Arizona, April, and even Addison, but the judge had heard enough. He asked to clear the room but Bailey had something more to say. She stated Meredith had in fact broken the law to save a life, so she deserved to pick up trash, but she did not deserve to have her license taken over it. Bailey stated Meredith was too good of a surgeon for that and that everything she had survived made her better instead of cold or hard. Everyone then had to clear the room. Meredith waited outside until Nancy came to deliver the news that the majority of the panel had voted to drop the entire thing, meaning she got to keep her license. Meredith briefly hugged Andrew and was then flooded with hugs from her other friends. As they all left the hotel, Bailey told Meredith she could return to work at Grey Sloan. Meredith accepted the offer and hugged her.\n\nAt home, she ran into Jackson as Maggie was throwing him out. Shortly after, Andrew arrived. He wanted to talk. She apologized for what she had said about their relationship. He knew she had meant it. He pointed out everything he had done for her with the whole insurance fraud situation, which he said was what you do for your partner. However, he had come to realize that unlike him, she did not truly see him as her partner. While she was talking about Derek in that hearing, he realized that she didn't respect him like she did Derek. Meredith told him she respected him, too, but he insisted some part of her was wondering if he would ever be her equal. He told her to take some time to think about her future and if she wanted him to be a part of that.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn her first day back, Meredith snuck into work to do two lap appies before breakfast to ease back in. Cristina also had sent her a package to congratulate her but it was nowhere to be found. The resident presented her with a welcome back cake. Andrew didn't know she was coming back. She said she had wanted to tell him but he was too busy dumping her. He said he hadn't dumped her but it was all the same to her. While rounding on [[Jamie Caldwell]], [[Cormac Hayes|Dr. Cormac Hayes]] abruptly interrupted and introduced himself as the new head of peds. He sidelined Meredith and had Andrew present the case again. Scans revealed a mass. Cormac suspected a tumor but Meredith suggested it may be leftover gallstones from the gallbladder removal she had performed a few years back. She didn't want to worry Jamie and her mother about cancer until a biopsy had confirmed it. Cormac went behind her back and told them anyway. Meredith stepped in and assured them nothing was certain yet. During surgery, the biopsy results came in, revealing the mass was not malignant. She went to take it out. Cormac objected but Meredith shut him down by saying he was a guest in her house. It turned out Meredith had been right with her guess.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith learns that Cristina sent her Cormac as a present.]]\nIn post-op, Jamie didn't care about the successful surgery as her crush still hadn't texted her back. Cormac stepped in and said that raising boys himself had taught him that boys are just terrified of talking to girls, so it didn't mean that he wasn't interested in her at all. While leaving work, Meredith ended up on an elevator with Cormac and asked him if it was his thing to scare people at first and then bask in the relief with them later. He told her he just preferred to give people all the information and let them figure out what to do with it, a courtesy that his wife's doctors hadn't shown him before she did. He told her they would have to learn how to live together in her house. As he stepped off, Cristina finally informed Meredith her package wasn't a thing but a person: Cormac, whom she had nicknamed McWidow. Meredith then stared after him, not noticing Andrew who had been planning to set the record straight.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith went to complain about Cormac to Alex and Jo, only to find that Alex was in Iowa and that Jo had brought home a baby from her Safe Haven volunteer work. Link pointed out Jo had kidnapped a baby but Meredith understood why she had taken the baby for the night. They barely had time to catch up before the three of them were paged to the hospital for multiple traumas after a car crashed into Joe's bar. Meredith called in Owen and Richard to help out. After checking that Andrew was okay, Meredith began treating [[Taryn Helm]]. While she implanted an IVC filter, an inebriated Taryn confessed that she was in love with Meredith. Meredith didn't really react to save her from further embarrassment. She wanted to return to the ER with Levi, who collapses. Meredith did a full workup and diagnosed cardiomyopathy. She paged Teddy, who did an angio while Meredith sat by his head. Meredith assured Levi that she had forgiven him for reporting the insurance fraud. Afterward, Meredith briefly talked with Cormac. Jo saw them and commented she could see something between them. Richard then asked her to come. He told her Bailey had had a miscarriage and needed some comforting. They got a box of doughnuts and sat down with her in her office so she wouldn't feel lonely.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith texted Cristina to get more info on Cormac but Cristina stayed mum. Cormac came into the lounge to get coffee and after he was gone, Amelia commented on his being hot. Meredith then went to find Andrew and told him that she didn't like his telling her to take time to think. He told her about his patient who was inexplicably having fevers three days after a routine appendectomy. Meredith said she'd think on it but advised him to also tell Bailey. Before leaving, she told him she was missing him. He reminded her that he hadn't dumped her so she didn't have to miss him. En route to the ER, Meredith asked Cormac about Cristina, though he didn't realize whom she was talking about. While waiting on the scans of their shared patients, he asked her not to hold their first meeting against him as it was around the time he had lost his wife two years earlier. She understood and assured him it would get better over time, though not all the way better. They disagreed over approaches and had to convert to his when hers failed. He didn't hold it against her as he had had the same disagreement with Cristina once, though he was on Meredith's side back then. He then realized Meredith had brought up Cristina earlier but she made an excuse and left without divulging any further information about their connection. She went to Andrew, who still hadn't figured out what was wrong with his patient, and asked him to talk her through the entire case.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThat led them to reconcile to some degree. They spent the night together. In the morning, he received word that his patient [[Suzanne Britland]] was being moved to the CCU. While getting dressed, he said they should talk about their relationship soon and revealed he had lured diagnostician [[Lauren Riley]] from UCSF to the hospital using Meredith's name before rushing out. At work, Meredith encountered Cormac as he was giving his boys a tour of the hospital. She ran into Amelia, who had seen Andrew leave the house and wondered if they were back together. Meredith said it was just sex at this point. Later, Lauren approached her, and Meredith wrongly addressed her as the consult from UCLA, making Lauren realize that Andrew had lied. On her way to consult on Levi's patient, she ran into Cormac, whose boys had ditched him in an attempt to make them late for the parent-teacher conferences. He was in awe of her staying sane while combining her job and raising her three kids, though she admitted to dropping some balls here and there. Meredith had to tell Levi's patient that her cancer had metastasized beyond the point of treatment. She came to see how Levi set up a dance floor in the cafeteria for the patient and her husband, which made her reflect on how she used to be the kind of person who did romantic things like that. Now, she broke up with Andrew after her trial and just woke up happy to get to practice medicine the next day without giving the break-up much thought. Bailey told her that it was part of growing up. Jackson then came in to inform them that Richard was refusing to work at Grey Sloan on Catherine's terms. The three of them threatened to quit if Tom didn't rehire Richard and Owen on their terms. Tom complied.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and Carina share their concerns over Andrew's mental health.]]\nMeredith started to put together a pro bono surgery day. As she was recruiting Cormac to operate, Andrew interrupted the conversation to inquire about a past patient of hers who had developed a post-op rash similar to Suzanne's, whom they had taken off all her meds so more indicative symptoms could manifest. Meredith talked him through the case and noticed that he was speaking fast and apparently had not slept for days. She confronted Lauren's about her treating Andrew like a machine but Lauren pointed out she was counting on it, with Suzanne's life hanging in the balance. Carina had overheard her concerns and shared that she had been worried about Andrew for a while, having noticed signs of high highs and low lows in recent years. Meredith was on the fence if his dedication was mania or healthy obsession but Carina pointed out she wouldn't ask that question about a resident she didn't love. Meredith then took her concerns to Bailey, who put Meredith on Suzanne's case to approve every step.\n\nOut of nowhere, as Meredith was checking on Suzanne, Andrew and Lauren rushed in with the diagnosis of Still's disease and Andrew injected her with high-dose steroids without any explanation. Meredith pointed out he could have taken a minute to explain his actions before administrating steroids, which could kill her if they were wrong about the diagnosis. Fortunately, they were right and Suzanne quickly recovered. Meredith sought out Andrew to inform him about her status but he lashed out. She said that move could have ended his career had it gone wrong and she pointed out he was not in the right state of mind to make life-and-death decisions. He blamed her for being a hypocrite. Cormac tried to intervene but Meredith had it covered. Andrew went on praising himself for saving Suzanne's life against all odds, which led Meredith to point out he was sounding like his father. She suggested he get some sleep, but he said he didn't need any of this nor her. He told her they were done and left. Cormac suggested the write him up but Meredith declined. She sat down to text Alex, who started typing up a reply but stopped, which worried her.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAlex continued to dodge her even though she knew he was not in Iowa. As a blizzard hit Seattle and blocked off all roads, Cormac was unable to get a donor liver from Seattle Pres to Grey Sloan. Andrew overheard and offered to go get it himself, being used to the cold due to growing up in Wisconsin. Meredith tried to talk him out of it but he brushed off her concerns and took off. While he was off, Meredith and Cormac worked to stabilize the girl, who developed a hemorrhage. As they waited, she told him about how she got fired and he talked about him and Cristina treating a kid with a similar condition in Switzerland, bringing up a story Cristina had told him about Alex saving a kid with that condition as well. He said Cristina talked about Alex a lot but Meredith was surprised to hear she had never mentioned her to Cormac.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith gets to know Cormac as they wait for the liver.]]\nAn hour after they got word Andrew had left Seattle Pres with the liver, Meredith got anxious. Cormac told her about moving to Switzerland after his wife's death, which she likened to her fleeing to San Diego. They talked about lives without their spouses and agreed the firsts without them are especially tough. Andrew then came in with the liver and frostbitten fingers, as he had forgotten to wear gloves. Meredith and Cormac saved the girl. She went to inform Andrew, whose fingers had been treated by Jackson. Together with Carina, she again voiced her concerns over his mental state but he ordered her to leave the room. She and Cormac left the hospital to go spoil their kids. He asked her who Andrew was to her. She replied he was a first, the first man she told \"I love you\" to after Derek. He told her it was nice to meet someone widowed young like him. She agreed. As she walked off, Cormac told her Cristina mentioned her \"twisted sister\" a lot, whom he now suspected was Meredith. She just shrugged and walked off.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOn her day off, she received a letter from Alex. He wrote that he had left Seattle, admitting he had chosen the easy way out as he didn't want her to give him crap for his decision to set him straight. He revealed he was with Izzie and explained that he reached out to get a letter of support for Meredith's trial, which finally gave him a good excuse to reach out to her. He wrote that during his call with Izzie, he heard children in the background, and Izzie told him they were his. She had used the frozen embryos, which he had given her permission to do way back when. He had secretly taken off to meet his twins right after the trial. He went on to describe his kids and his life with Izzie and said he needed to be a father to his kids, which Meredith had taught him how to be through being a mother to her kids. He wrote that he'd miss the hell out of her but assured her that she was perfectly capable of being her own person with him and Cristina gone. He also asked her not to show up to his house to talk him into returning to Seattle because, for the first time in his life, he felt that he was exactly where he needed to be. He concluded by saying she was always welcome to visit once she had accepted his decision so that his kids could meet their Auntie Mer, adding that he hoped she wouldn't hate him too much. Meredith was emotional but decided to respect his wish. Later, she explained to Zola that Uncle Alex had left.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Amelia inquired about Alex's departure but Meredith said she didn't want to talk about it. She and Levi treated Noelle, a woman who had had an accident working jobs through an app that she needed to make ends meet. The patient revealed she had been rationing her insulin. At that moment, Meredith was paged by Tom and found that he had cleared an entire floor for [[Griffin Ford]], a VIP billionaire patient, which explained the problem with admissions that Noelle had had. Tom had her examine Griffin, who came to the hospital looking for a medical reason as to why he had made a grave error that had caused a rocket to explode above Seattle. She reluctantly did the exam but took off as soon as Noelle's CT results got back, leaving Griffin in Jackson's care. Noelle coded and went into DIC. They were unable to save her. She ran into Tom, who asked her what she would do with Griffin's money. She had a whole list ready on how to improve the world. He then asked her how she decided which rules to break. She told him she just followed her gut to make the world better. At the end of the day, Meredith reflected on the inequity she had witnessed and told Bailey she missed Alex to cheer her up. She finally told someone she wasn't sure she could do this on her own. Bailey recognized the feeling, being the last one standing from her residency class, and then told Meredith that Richard was stepping down from surgery.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith meets her pro bono patients.]]\nOn her pro bono surgery day, she had  surgeries to divide among four surgeons, all before Tom would shut down the project at  PM. She tried to recruit Richard but he still refused to operate. Patients and their family members grew upset as Meredith had to solve multiple issues, like Andrew going behind her back and messing up her OR schedule to get a patient into an OR and away from her supposed aunt as he suspected the patient was a human trafficking victim. She ended up asking Tom for more time. He complied and spontaneously agreed to pay for the overtime, explaining that Griffin Ford paid them a lot of money. She pieced together that Tom had made a fake diagnosis to fit Griffin's agenda in exchange for a large amount of money, which Tom was planning on using to fix the world like she had advised him too. Suddenly, a code violet was called and she found Andrew making a scene in the OR waiting room, where he tried to keep his patient's aunt away from her niece. As he was yelling accusations, Meredith and other attendings formed a human circle around him, indicating he was the dangerous person rather than the aunt and convinced him to go to Bailey's office.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith convinces Andrew not to quit.]]\nShe later found out he had quit as he felt people were obstructing him in accomplishing the impossible and changing lives. She told him she loved him and begged him not to quit and instead take the suspension Bailey had proposed so that he wouldn't ruin his career. He agreed to that only if Meredith called the national trafficking hotline, which she agreed to. Later, Amelia came to ask for a spot for her veteran patient and when Meredith agreed, an uproar ensued among the other scheduled patients, who feared they'd be sent home without their promised surgery. Meredith then decided that everyone would get their surgery and that the hospital would host a monthly pro bono surgery day from here on out, for which she credited their generous donor. They managed to perform all the surgeries. Bailey later informed her that the aunt and her niece had disappeared, making them fear that Andrew had been right. Cormac complimented her on her work today but she was too concerned about the human trafficking situation to accept the praise. He then said he could finally see the twisted-ness Cristina had been talking about.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was supposed to accompany Richard to Los Angeles for his speech on his PathPen at the Surgical Innovation Conference but she had to stay home as her sitter got the flu. Zola set up a live feed for them to watch his talk, which went disastrously as he dismissed his Pen and started rambling nonsense about having found a cure for cancer. A worried Meredith watched in horror as Maggie and Cormac dragged Richard off the stage and called for an ambulance.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith and Bailey set up a war room at the hospital and gathered the attendings to figure out what was going on with Richard. Unlike the others, Meredith was convinced it was not Alzheimer's. Together with Maggie, she ran some cognitive tests, which he failed miserably. When Richard disappeared from his room, she found him hallucinating in an OR, about to slice open his abdomen. She told him she could fix him as he was the one who taught her everything about surgery, life, and being a parent. She said she wasn't ready to lose him yet. Her talk brought him back to reality and he handed over the scalpel. As he slowly realized something was wrong with him, he addressed her as Ellis. She took him back to his room. Still convinced it was something other than rapidly progressing Alzheimer's, she sought out Andrew, who secretly had been working on the case, and had him show her what he had come up with so far. She told him they wouldn't leave until they figured it out and got to work.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nThe two of them spent days at the hospital trying to find the diagnosis with other doctors coming and going to help out. After a week of Meredith ignoring her home life, Maggie reminded her of how she herself had pushed her mother while refusing to accept the reality of her impending death. She thought Meredith was doing the same to Richard, refusing to believe it was Alzheimer's. Since Tom and Amelia agreed it was Alzheimer's, Catherine decided to take him home. Meredith found Andrew disrespectfully yelling at Catherine for her decision. She sent him for a walk and apologized for his behavior. Meredith then joined Catherine, Maggie, and Bailey to go discharge Richard, who brought up that his feet and hands were numb. Meredith then convinced Catherine to let her run an EMG, which showed impaired function. Tom and Amelia then changed their opinion and agreed to a nerve biopsy. Right before the procedure, Andrew barged in and knocked over the tray with instruments to stop them from performing the biopsy. He said Richard had received a hip replacement with cobalt, which could be deteriorating and leaking into his blood. Meredith drew blood for a test, which came back positive. She advocated with Bailey to let Andrew scrub in to watch up close despite his inappropriate behavior before, though Bailey stressed that he was on the thin ice. Link successfully removed the hip, which would solve the problems.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith finds a broken down Andrew.]]\nAfter work, Cormac complimented Meredith on her diagnosis and asked her for a drink. She asked for a rain check and walked off. She then found a broken down Andrew sitting at the nurses' station. He had completely fallen apart. She pulled him up and took him home.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nShe didn't feel comfortable leaving him at home by himself so she took him back to work with her the next day, leaving him to rest in an on-call room. She informed Carina, who hated that she and Bailey had pushed him to this point in spite of her warnings about his condition. However, they yet again had to push him past his limits when [[Erin Banks]], the human trafficking victim, showed up at the hospital again asking for him specifically. They had Andrew accompany her during the pre-op exams. Meredith and Bailey operated on her and they discussed Andrew during the surgery. As Bailey remembered her own struggle to accept her mental illness, Meredith advocated for Bailey not to give up on Andrew either. They staged an intervention with Carina, Richard, and [[Cynthia Cole|his psychiatrist]]. Meredith told him that caring so much and fighting as hard for his patients as he did was a strength. He broke down as he had failed to attain the most important goal in his life, which was not to end up like his father. Meredith convinced him to fight as hard for himself as he had done for his patients, at which point he accepted to get treatment for his bipolar disorder. Afterward, Meredith and Bailey walked [[Abby Banks]] to the ICU to be reunited with her long-lost sister.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> At some point during the day, she also met her [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|new nephew]] and left the new parents to fight about the baby's name.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs COVID- first hit the United States, Seattle was amongst the country's cities to be hit the hardest, forcing Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to quickly adapt to the new reality. With all non-emergent surgeries cancelled, Meredith was one of the doctors doing shifts in the special COVID- ICU, where she had to run codes all the time and where most of her patients kept dying suddenly and unexpectedly. Since visitors were no longer routinely allowed, she had to witness how these patients died without their loved ones, who had to be informed either by a phone call or by another doctor who was assigned to the visitors' tent outside. She developed a habit of reciting surgical steps in her head to deal with her claustrophobia in the PPE. While working shifts, she also tried to contact Andrew, who had disappeared without a word. With yet another death imminent, she called the patient's daughter to rush to the hospital to be able to say goodbye. Her frustration finally hit a boiling point and she destroyed a supply room. She was surprised when Andrew arrived, now an attending. He informed her he was doing well and had spent his time asleep at home to keep the mania from creeping back in. While she was glad he was doing okay, she told him to inform people on his whereabouts.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nOn one of her breaks, she went outside to catch some fresh air. She ran into Cormac and Jackson, whom she was jealous of for having operated earlier that day. Having overheard her talk with Jackson, Cormac paged her to scrub in with him when [[Frankie Morris]] was admitted with a tree branch perforating his recently transplanted kidney. She was delighted to get to do what she is best at again. While operating, Cormac inquired about her kids. She hadn't seen them in two weeks since she was quarantining away from home. Cormac hoped his boys wouldn't go out and break the rules like Frankie had done, though Meredith understood Frankie, remembering how she was as a teenager. They successfully removed the injured pole of the kidney and had Frankie admitted to the ICU. An exhausted Meredith then returned to the COVID ICU. She received a text from Cormac inviting her for a whiskey in his office, but didn't see the text because she had fallen asleep. She woke up when Andrew showed up to take over from her. She put up some resistance, stating she could keep going after the high of the surgery, but Andrew reminded her that a certain friend had once stressed the importance of getting rest. She asked if she was his friend now. He said that she had saved him, so she could be whatever she wanted to be to him. She then agreed to let him take over. However, she collapsed in the parking lot, where Cormac found her unconscious. Meredith herself was dreaming of a [[Meredith's Beach|beach]], which she had dreamt about before while taking short naps in the COVID ICU. However, this time, she was greeted by Derek from a distance.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nShe was rushed inside and a COVID test came back positive. She was admitted to a regular room on a COVID ward, where she used her connections to get her a tablet to be able to stay on top of the situation at the hospital. After four days, Meredith found that the hospital was nearly at capacity for COVID patients so she requested to be allowed to go quarantine in a hotel as she felt fit enough. However, as Teddy and Andrew were debating her request, she passed out again, yet again finding herself at the beach with Derek. She tried to reach him but woke up as Andrew and Maggie got her back into bed and rushed her to radiology for a chest CT. After the scan showed a dire situation, Meredith suggested they start her on triple antiviral therapy on which she had found an article. Meredith once again awoke from a beach dream when Amelia video chatted with little Ellis. Maggie tried to talk to her about her healthcare directive but Meredith brushed it off so she could talk to her daughter. Back on the beach, she tried to reach Derek but somehow always ended up back at the starting point far away from him. He yelled that she was worried about the kids and that the sand wasn't real. She yelled back that she missed him, which he knew. Bailey later came in to talk about the healthcare directive, pointing out that Alex would have to make rough decisions over the phone if things went south. Meredith insisted Alex would know when to pull the plug and asked Bailey to distract her instead. Later, she explained to Cormac that it was tough to pick a new POA as everyone was like family to her. He advised her to write down exactly what she wanted and then pick someone who would defend her choices, like his late wife had chosen her sister instead of him. Meredith then admitted she was scared she wouldn't wake up if she were to fall asleep, though Cormac was confident she was tough enough to beat the virus. Meredith ended up picking Richard as her POA. She explained she didn't want a ventilator as there was a shortage. Richard pointed out that she might end up as one of the people needing it and stressed that everyone at the hospital needed her. Meredith once again fell asleep as labs showed a worsening condition. She tried to reach Derek again, making a run for it, but she tripped and fell. From a distance, Derek laughed and told her he would be right there for her when she was ready.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith sees George.]]\nWhile sound asleep, Meredith found herself on her beach again, this time with [[George O'Malley]] present. She was delighted to see him and he backed Derek's statement that the sand wasn't real, nor was the ocean or his body. She commented on his looking older than when he had died, which he attributed to her imagining him that way being more comfortable for her. He revealed he had checked in on her and her kids sometimes. She asked if she could decide to go back to the world of the living but he didn't know. He said if he had had the choice, he would have chosen to stay. As they walked, they discussed how his death had devastated her and how she managed to move on from his and even Derek's death. He stated that, unlike her, his mother had become stuck in the grief over his death. In reality, Meredith's condition progressively worsened and as her power of attorney, Richard was tasked with the decision about whether or not to admit her into a trial. As he agonized by her bedside, Meredith became aware of his presence and she imagined him on the beach with her and George, who talked about what he missed about life. Richard talked about trying to stay strong for everyone worrying about her. Meredith apologized to him for that while George pointed out that Richard might break if Meredith decided to stay on her beach. \"I know, George,\" she uttered. Surprised by her sudden communication, indicative of how far gone she was already, Richard decided in favor of the trial.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and George have a heart-to-heart on her beach.]]\nAs they lied down on the sand, Meredith asked George if he regretted having chosen [[Amanda]] over himself. He dodged the question and said out she would have done the same thing, pointing out she contracted COVID- by working the frontlines and thus putting others above herself. She then told him that that was something she had him to thank for, as he had shown her how to go all in for people. He profoundly changed her life yet she never got to tell him that before. The two of them were joined by Richard and Bailey as Meredith became aware of their presence watching over her in real life.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith briefly woke up and was informed by Andrew that they had gotten her into the antibody trial. After having received the treatment, her oxygen needs dropped yet she remained sound asleep. Meredith was briefly joined again on her beach by Bailey, whose mother had been admitted with COVID as well. Bailey had kept from Meredith and Richard that her mother was suffering from Alzheimer's she didn't want to open any old wounds for them, yet with her mother dying, she found herself at a loss when trying to handle the big feelings that came with the impending death of her mother. Meredith tried to show support yet she was too weak to react to her opening up.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Meredith woke up and showed a spectacular recovery. Amelia came in to update her on her kids and Andrew was optimistic they would be able to discharge her within a week if she continued to improve at the current rate. Andrew later returned to her room and she asked for an update on the patient he had taken over from her. He reported only three of them recovered. Meredith wished she could help but Andrew stated that he didn't feel helpful despite his daily shifts in the COVID ward. He was then paged away. Later, Meredith was surprised by a visit from Tom, who had heard from Maggie about her miraculous recovery. Having bribed a nurse to wheel him to Meredith's room, Tom uttered that he needed to be in a room where no one was dying. He broke down and Meredith reached for his hand to comfort him. During a talk about why neurosurgeons are the best lovers, a code blue was called for a patient down the hall. Both of them missed saving lives and were frustrated about having to sit on the sidelines. They overheard that the patient didn't pull through.  As they talked about their kids, a nurse spotted Tom and brought him back to his room. She had a nap and was woken up by a beeping monitor from the patient across the hall. She pulled her own alarm to start a code blue, but when there was no immediate response, Meredith made her way across the hall and started compressions. She intubated the patient with the help of two nurses before the code team arrived. She then collapsed in Taryn's arms. A passed-out Meredith was scanned and her lungs showed significant damage, which Teddy didn't find surprising as the trial drug couldn't reverse damage that already occurred. She suspected Meredith had been on a COVID high and the exertion had pushed her over the edge. Teddy deemed that Meredith's lungs were at a breaking point and suggested they needed to put her on a vent. With more patients surviving recently after having been on a vent, Richard agreed with her suggestion. Meredith was moved to the ICU, where Teddy intubated her and put her on a vent. Meanwhile, Meredith found herself back on her beach, overlooking the ocean.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith remained comatose. She was joined on her beach by Andrew, who had been stabbed while tailing a [[Opal|human trafficker]]. Andrew questioned if they were alive. She thought that they were. They agreed the beach suited them both. Before she could ask, he told her he didn't regret what he had done. People go through life ignoring atrocities all the time but it makes sense to stand up and fight for people, like Meredith had shown him with [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabby]]. Andrew's condition worsened in real life. On the beach, he started building a sandcastle and Meredith warned him about the rising tide, a metaphor for his death. He was aware and worked fast to beat the tide. He said he had more to do, more plans in life. The water then destroyed his castle. Defeated, he admitted he had no clue what would happen now. Meredith didn't know either. He told Meredith he never felt seen the way she saw him. She made him want to be better. He felt small around her sometimes because he wanted something from her that only he could give himself. Being on the beach with her, he finally felt that true acceptance of who he was and what his strengths were. Meredith suggested they take a walk to watch the sunset, but he wanted to hold on to the feeling for a little while longer. With Andrew slipping away on the OR table, he and Meredith ended up watching the sunset. His mother appeared on the beach at a distance and called out for him. Realizing the moment had come, Meredith told Andrew she would miss him if she were to end up going back without him. He told her it would be okay. He realized he had to go now. He got up and eagerly ran towards his mother, who happily embraced him. Andrew briefly turned around and waved at her before walking off into the afterlife with his mother as Meredith watched him leave.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith's numbers slowly began to improve, Teddy began lightening her sedation and ventilator settings. Meredith continued to spend time with Derek on her beach, while Cormac sat by her side asking her to pull through since the hospital couldn't handle another loss after Andrew. Meredith found the obligatory distance between her and Derek to be torture, which he pointed out was her own doing. She brought up that he never got to meet Ellis, but he showcased enough knowledge about her and her resemblance to Meredith as well as Zola writing him letters to inform her that he had been watching over them. Derek also told her that if she wanted to get closer to him, she had to do that herself by relaxing. She tried that, which resulted in the two of them getting a little closer. Meanwhile, Meredith's numbers deteriorated, so Teddy turned back the ventilator settings. Cormac set up a video chat between Zola and a tablet in Meredith's room so Zola could talk to her mother. This as well as Cormac asking her to fight for her kids got through to Meredith and Derek on her beach. Derek told Meredith it was up to her but he advised her to listen to Cormac. She then let him in, replacing Derek on her beach. He talked about her kids and their traits and how they needed for her to fight. Meredith wasn't sure that she could since the beach was comfortable and pain-free. Cormac talked about he loss of his wife impacted their kids and again begged her to fight. Derek then reappeared and told her he would be right there for her. She then decided to fight and walked away from him. Cormac was delighted to see her move her head. He set up a livestream to Andrew's memorial service him, while Meredith herself began pulling away again as she went back to talking to Derek, the distance between them gradually decreasing.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith remained stable on the vent. She appeared in Teddy's subconsciousness as Teddy went catatonic at Andrew's memorial service. Meredith guided her to examine the causes for her behavior over the years, hinting that she had to look further back than her affair with Tom. Eventually, Teddy traced back the root of the issues to her guilt over the loss of Allison and other people in her life, including her parents, Henry, and Andrew, as well as Meredith barely holding on. Meredith told Teddy that all those people couldn't have been saved regardless of Teddy's actions. Meredith pointed out the losses had taught Teddy to run from pain as well joy for thinking she didn't deserve the latter. She said joy and pain are a package deal in life. Meredith got her to accept that. Teddy begged her not to die and Meredith said she would do her best.<ref>[[In My Life]], x</ref>\n\nAs her oxygen sats began improving significantly, Meredith was moved from the ICU to regular room with her ventilator. Her doctors were comfortable with getting her off the vent, yet feared that there would not be a ventilator available for her due to a hospital-wide shortage if she were to trend downward again. Meredith was visited on her beach by Mark and Lexie. Lexie asked her if she was going to stay. Meredith wasn't sure. Mark thought it was too early for her since Zola was only Sofia's age. Meredith told them about Derek but Mark said it wasn't up to him. As she watched Lexie and Mark frolic on the beach, she reiterated that she liked the beach. Later, Mark told Meredith it was nice to talk her, since most of the time people he tried to talking to didn't seem to hear him. Lexie asked Meredith about her favorite thing about life. Meredith replied it felt shallow to talk about that in the middle of a pandemic. Lexie pointed out that didn't mean she wasn't allowed to enjoy her life, stating that the having of a life and body was cause for celebration. If not, there was no point in avoiding death and she may as well just join Derek now. Meredith then told a story of Bailey made everyone laugh by faceplanting into his birthday cake. Meanwhile, Meredith was extubated and remained stable. Back on the beach, Meredith concluded that life is pain, with which Mark and Lexie disagreed. She cited her losses and all the pain in her life. Mark pointed out she knew what caused all the pain. Since Meredith couldn't bring herself to say it, Lexie said the depth of grief came from the depth of love. They advised Meredith not to fight change and resist pain, deeming it a waste of life. Meredith told them she missed them so much. Lexie said they never left her. Together, they told Meredith not to waste a single more minute of life.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\nSince Meredith still didn't wake up despite no longer being sedated and off the vent, Richard ordered a CT to find a possible underlying cause. The CT came back negative. Jo then came in to tell Meredith that she was changing specialties to OB because she needed to find job and her home life wasn't bringing her joy anymore. She hoped Meredith would wake up soon so she could tell her all that again while she was awake. However, she finally woke up later that day and told Richard that she was sorry he had had to decide whether or not to put her on a vent. He told her he would do it again in a heartbeat. Meredith then told him they needed to talk about Jo and shared what Jo had told her before. Soon after, she fell asleep again for the rest of the day.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nMoved back to the ICU, Meredith continued to spend most of the time being asleep. Teddy and Bailey tasked Levi with taking her to the hyperbaric chamber, which they hoped would help. They ended up having to share the chamber with [[James Chee]] and his patient. James asked Levi if Meredith really was as mean as he'd heard. Levi replied that he heard her voice with every win that he booked. He called her his most influential teacher, tough when need be. When the other patient's abdominal wound opened up, Levi handled the situation perfectly with Meredith's guiding voice in his head from when they handled a similar complication together before.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith improved and she was moved back to a regular room, yet remained at all times unconscious or asleep. Her vitals remained stable and imaging showed improvement, confusing her doctors as to why she wasn't waking up. Meredith herself spent more time on her beach with Derek where they talked about his death. He says the worst part was knowing the doctors were getting it wrong and eventually, the desire to rest outweighed the desire to stay. Meredith recalled the moment of giving him her blessing to go. Derek appreciated that she gave him everything he needed until his last breath. Meredith wanted to get closer to Derek yet knew she might never leave the beach if she did. She brought up his handling his father's death and said their children would be okay, too. As they brought up Amelia, Derek told Meredith that people love and need her. Derek knew Meredith was still fighting to live despite feeling tired, since her soul wouldn't let him come close. She inquired if it was hard for him to see her dating other men. He replied it was harder to see her lonely. He commented on her beauty yet acknowledged it felt shallow; she said she taught their children to say \"pretty on the inside.\" Meanwhile, Winston chatted to Meredith, wishing she would wake up to meet him and congratulate him on getting engaged to her sister. Her labs eventually showed elevated liver enzymes. A CT revealed a blood clot in her liver so Teddy and Winston carefully performed a TIPS procedure to remove the clot. \n\nMeanwhile, Meredith told Derek that Ellis draws about the two of them in traditional wedding clothes. As she told that story, they suddenly found themselves wearing exactly that. They held a little impromptu wedding ceremony. Meredith asked Derek what he wanted her to promise. He wanted her to torture herself less. They then leaned into a near-kiss while Meredith said she didn't want to leave the kids. After the procedure, Meredith's labs improved yet she still didn't wake up for hours. Winston then orchestrated a visit from Zola with Maggie and Richard's help. As Zola talked to her mother, all of her close colleagues gathered outside the room. Back on the beach, Derek told Meredith it wasn't her time yet. While she stated she enjoyed the beach where pain didn't exist, he told her he even missed the pain of being alive. He said she needed to go back to their kids. Meredith finally woke up as Zola was talking about allowing Ellis and Bailey into her room. Meredith faintly told her daughter that that was nice of her. Zola hugged her mother and said she loved her. Meredith then told her that \"they\" loved her, too. As the doctors celebrated, Derek walked away from Meredith as she finally chose to live.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith aced her respiratory exams and was prepared to be discharged while Bailey and Richard struggled to tell her about DeLuca's death. As they awaited her final lab results, Maggie and Richard took Meredith for walks down the hallways. Meredith was eager to finally meet her soon-to-be brother-in-law, whose dance moves Zola couldn't shut up about. As Meredith asked for more updates, Richard decides not to tell her about Andrew and told her that Jackson was leaving for Boston to take on a leadership role within the Fox Foundation. When the physical therapist cleared Meredith to go home, she started clearing out her room as Jackson joined her to say goodbye. Meredith said his departure officially made her the last man standing of their residency class. She recalled thinking he had a big name to live up to. Jackson said that name was ruined now but Meredith was confident he could make it his own and re-invent it. She then expressed desire not to face the traditional clap-out, where he planned for their final goodbye to take place. He encouraged her to let people celebrate the win. She told him to \"go give 'em hell\" in Boston and he thanked her for showing him how. Soon after, Richard and Bailey finally gathered the courage to tell her about Andrew. As soon as they brought up his name, Meredith had her experiences echo in her mind and told them that Andrew was with his mother. Meredith decided not to sit through the clap-out and had Jackson sneak her out through the back exit. They laughed as they got in his car and he drove her home. She surprised Amelia and her kids as they were preparing for her arrival. The kids finished their \"welcome home\" sign as they sat with their mother on the couch. Amelia swore they didn't spent months living a chaotic life like this. Meredith enjoyed the chaos and complimented Amelia on keeping her household running. She showed her profound gratitude as Link came rushing in to warn everyone about Meredith's arrival. Much to his surprise, she was already there. He fetched the donuts and Meredith had her kids fill her in on their lives.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref>\n\nDuring her first week of recovery, Meredith found Amelia hovering over her. She urged Amelia to go be of use to the world at work. The next week, Meredith started to be come more active. She was throwing a ball around with her son when Bailey visited. Meredith was exhausted from the activity and asked Bailey to talk about her life to distract her. After a month, Bailey dropped by to give Meredith a suture kit so she could get her dexterity back. Meredith had been reading up on the effects of long-COVID, which terrified her. Bailey tried to encourage her to talk a walk with her but Meredith wasn't feeling up for it. She said she'd never operate again if she couldn't stand on her feet long enough. Picking up her kids felt like running a marathon. Meredith was growing tired of people hovering over her and just wanted her old life back. Two weeks later, Bailey visited again and Meredith said Jackson and Tom had the right idea. She spent weeks fighting to get back to normal but she now realized that normal entailed sexism, racism, inequality, and substandard care. Bailey then proposed Meredith take over the residency program from Richard, who had too many jobs and would step back one day. She asked Meredith to put together a team that reflected their world and take over all the classes and shape them to sandblast bias out of the curriculum for future surgeons. Meredith accepted the job.<ref>[[I'm Still Standing]], x</ref>\n\nIn August , Meredith returned to work as residency director. She decided not to use Richard's infamous speech and instead jumped right in by asking the residents about the status of the newly admitted COVID patients. She later met Cormac in front of the OR board. He assured her she would be operating again soon, which she doubted. He then joked she could have just turned him down when he asked her for that drink rather than getting COVID. She commented that seemed like a lifetime ago and recalled him coming into her room to tell her to fight for her kids. Meredith left work early to attend Maggie's wedding in the backyard, which was postponed indefinitely mid-ceremony. \n\nA month later, Meredith met [[Gerlie Bernardo]], who was being discharged after having spent a month in the hospital with COVID. Having struggled with her own recovery, Gerlie found it reassuring to see Meredith back at work. Meredith sympathized with the residual symptoms Gerlie was experiencing, survivor's guilt being one of them. Meredith confided that that would never go away. Gerlie then collapsed and was re-admitted. Meredith took on her case and used it as a hands-on approach to teach the residents in a more practical manner, substituting the traditional grand rounds. Bailey was surprised with her approach to teaching but Meredith reminded her she was hired to change things around. However, during Gerlie's bronchoscopy, Meredith became dizzy and had to have Maggie take over.\n\nBy Christmas Eve, Gerlie had further deteriorated and had to put on ECMO on Christmas Eve. Meredith took to researching lung transplants in COVID patients. Cormac met her in the attendings' lounge and presented her with a half-empty bottle of whiskey. They finally shared their first drink. The next morning, Amelia, Link, Owen, Teddy, and their kids came over to Meredith's house for Christmas. During the celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy. As the new year began, the hospital received vaccines for the staff. Meredith began advocating for Gerlie to be put on the transplant list but Bailey shut her down, believing Gerlie would recover without the transplant. Meredith then had the residents continually press for the transplant whenever Bailey rounded with them. Bailey confronted Meredith about her tactics but Meredith stated that people suffering from the aftereffects of COVID needed advocates, too. Since she had learned that life could be short, she wanted to teach the residents what mattered most. Bailey then agreed to put Gerlie on the transplant list only if Meredith agreed to re-implement grand rounds.\n\nBy April , Meredith and her kids attended Winston and Maggie's beach wedding. Shortly after the ceremony, Meredith received words that UNOS had found lungs for Gerlie. Teddy and Meredith left the wedding to perform the surgery. As they got started, Meredith said it had helped for her to have a village of people pulling for her with every complication. Since Gerlie had no one, they had to be her village. Meredith rallied and finished the procedure without a problem. Post-procedure, they were met with a round of applause from the surgical staff for Meredith's recovery. As she sat by Gerlie's bedside, Meredith let Cristina know that she successfully performed a double lung transplant. Gerlie woke up surprised to see Meredith by her side; Meredith replied she wasn't going anywhere.<ref>[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter having fully recovered, Meredith and Cormac started seeing each other but their romance was short-lived since it caused his so Austin to suffer from panic attacks. Putting his children first, they quickly ended things.\n\nMeredith was invited to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota by [[David Hamilton]], a former colleague of her mother's, to attend the opening of a research library named after Ellis. While in Minnesota, Meredith was plagued by nightmares in which her mother challenged her to do more with her life than being a regular general surgery attending after having miraculously survived COVID. During her visit to the Clinic, Richard, Bailey, and Cormac called her to remind her of her ties to Grey Sloan and she swore she wasn't there for a job interview. Upon meeting David, he commented she was the spitting image of her mother and guided her to The Grey Center for Medical Research, a research lab he had begun to put together for Meredith if she were interested. He showed her around the lab and its extensive state-of-the-art equipment and explained he was developing cellular therapy for experimental surgery to cure Parkinson's disease. He had everything except a famous surgeon to convince the FDA to grant approval for a clinical trial, revealing that he intended for himself to be the first patient. David invited Meredith to dinner, where she noticed his tremor. David explained her name had become synonymous to cutting-edge and seeing things through to the end. She had him explain the idea behind the project and he stressed the opportunity to become the public face of a possible cure for Parkinson's disease. As she pondered his proposal, she saw [[Nick Marsh]] leaving the restaurant with his date. She told David she wasn't a neurosurgeon but he was confident she would attract the best talent for the project.\n\nUpon returning to the hotel, an employee escorted her to the bar where she found Nick waiting for her. He took a chance and guessed she would be staying at the five-star hotel near the hospital. Over drinks, he said he had spotted her back at the restaurant. His date was horrible. She shared she had just ended things with someone though that didn't mean the two of them would be sleeping together, which he was fine with. He updated her on Charlotte leaving for college and she told him she had survived COVID. He understood being a miracle was a lot of pressure, bearing the question of what you'll be doing with it. Nick walked her back to her room and she explained she would be staying a few more days to look at research. They wished each other good night and shared looks as he walked off. Meredith couldn't help but smile as she closed the door.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\nWhile up to get some water, Meredith heard something and found a note had been slid under her door. She quickly opened her door and called for Nick, who came back from around the corner. He had forgotten to ask for her number and wanted to ask her out on a date without waking her. She happily agreed to a date at a place by the lake. The next morning, Meredith had Amelia flown in from Seattle and informed her about the proposal as she showed her around the lab, stating she wanted Amelia to be part of the project if she were to accept it. After Amelia examined David, they went back to the lab where they met [[Kai Bartley]], a neuroscientist who had already boarded the project. Their work completely convinced Amelia, yet Meredith remained hesitant. Meredith questioned the influence the project would have on their kids' lives. Amelia said revolutionizing medicine would be a great example. Meredith remained on the fence about the consequences of a possible failure. Afterward, Meredith walked Amelia back to her car and thanked her for her input. Meredith locked eyes with Nick while Amelia kept talking about how on board she was with the project.\n\nAt the end of the day, Meredith found Nick waiting for her in the lobby in casual clothes while she had dressed herself up. She changed into something more comfortable. He took her to a favorite spot of his by the lake where he shared that he had cut back on his hours because he was starting to ignore the beautiful world around him. Meredith admitted she was, too. He asked her about the top-secret project she was in town for her. She admitted she was scared to say yes since it was risky, cost millions of dollar, and had the possibility of turning her into a public failure, while she had a safe and comfortable situation in Seattle. Thinking they were of similar nature, Nick knew she would trade all of that in for this project. No matter the outcome, it would be one hell of a ride. Meredith met up with David at the lab and set rules first. She demanded autonomy to pick her team and made sure any progress would be public and accessible to everyone. He agreed to all of those but refused to move the project to Seattle since it would cost them time he didn't have and even more money. Meredith then agreed to travel back and forth once a week. They shook hands as she finally accepted the proposal.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\n\nShe is intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, has good medical instincts, and a natural flair for medicine.\n\nMeredith and Derek have been described as polar opposites. She described herself as \"dark and twisty\" due to her negativity, in contrast to Derek's charismatic optimism. And unlike Derek, who viewed the world in distinct shades of black and white, Meredith tends to see things in shades of gray, which [[Carolyn Shepherd]] remarked to her son that was what he needed, while she was visiting Seattle.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Devil]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, this difference in viewpoints culminated in what was a breach of their marriage, when she messed up Derek's Alzheimer drug trial. She secretly accessed the pharmacy, where the trial drugs were stored, and subsequently swapped the placebo for the actual drug, for Patient #, aka Adele. And when busted by a drunk Alex, who had seen her behaving suspiciously, she much later confided in Cristina that she felt that her actions were justified, as Adele was Richard's wife, and she should do something since Adele was about to have saline injected into her brain, and the trial drug sample could help her from becoming a 'gorked out lump', in her own words. The couple subsequently got into an argument in the changing room, where Derek argued that it was Alzheimer's, a disease that she could potentially have, and one whose progression he was trying to stop or cure, while at the same time espousing that everything was black and white, a right and a wrong. Meredith responded that the situation was much more complicated than that, as it was Richard and Adele.\n\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\n[[Image:der-mer-sex.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Derek wake up after their first encounter.]]\nMeredith and Derek first met at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's Bar]] the night before her first day at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Derek approached her, they got drunk, before ending up at her place, sleeping with each other. When she went to work, she discovered, much to her shock, that Derek too worked at Seattle Grace, as an attending, so she staunchly refused to date him, although they did manage to sneak by a few stolen sexually charged moments. However, it was eventually at the unexpected house party that went out of control that she finally gave in and the two got intimate in the car. Despite Miranda Bailey, who felt that Derek was beginning to show signs of favoritism towards Meredith the following day, catching them in the act, the pair began to date secretly, something which her roommates would eventually discover, and thus were mostly not too pleased about as they thought she was trying to win favors and felt uncomfortable sharing living space with their \"boss's boss.\" They became public quickly, although [[Richard Webber]] discovered and disapproved of the relationship, knowing that Derek was still married to Addison. Their relationship temporarily ended when [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Shepherd]] arrived at the hospital for a medical case and claimed to be Derek's wife, thereby surprising her.\n\n[[File:Candles.jpg|thumb|px| Meredith and Derek's future house (made of candles).]]\nMeredith stayed away from Derek but later asked him to make a choice between her or Addison. Derek tried to make a decision, but it was a hard one, as he had been married to Addison for eleven years. He eventually chose Addison and Meredith was left heartbroken. Addison stayed at Seattle Grace and Meredith was left alone and when news of the scandal leaked out, she became much of the hospital's talking points and gossip. After avoiding each other, they attempted friendship, but on the night of the Seattle Grace prom, they had sex in an exam room despite the fact that Meredith was dating [[Finn Dandridge]] and Derek was married to Addison. An unexpected event of the secret rendezvous was Meredith losing her panties when Derek had pocketed them. The next day, Addison found Meredith's panties in Derek's pocket and realized her marriage was over. After Derek caught Addison and [[Mark Sloan]] together again, they both admitted their relationship was finished. He told Meredith that if she wanted, they could date and that he loved her. Meredith tried to choose between Derek and Finn, but when she was unable to decide between the two men, she decided to date both of them until she decided. After Derek decided to be a better person and let her go and be with Finn, she realized she wanted Derek and broke up with Finn. She didn't tell Derek immediately because he was going through his divorce with Addison but when she finally did, he no longer cared, as he was suffering from Addison's secret about her and Mark living together for months, after he had left her.\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek and Meredith get engaged.]]\n\nThey started dating again, but Derek later complained that she was constantly leaving him and that she should be worried that the highlight of his week was meeting another girl at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]]. When [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] and [[Preston Burke|Burke]] called off their wedding, she broke up with Derek, not convinced that relationships could work. They tried to stay apart but began having break-up sex, and mockery. Later, Derek kissed a nurse named [[Rose]] in the scrub room; when Meredith found out, she severed all ties with him. Derek and Meredith started a clinical trial but Derek began dating [[Rose]] and her feelings for him started to come back as the clinical trial continued. After their last clinical trial patient survived the surgery, Meredith and Derek celebrated and she showed him a house of candles she had made. He kissed her and they got back together. Trying to take steps forward, Meredith asked him to move in and he accepted. They stayed together and after his mother's visit, Derek decided to propose with his mother's engagement ring. Meredith originally thought he was avoiding her because of a conversation they had about babies, but he insisted that he wanted to have all her babies. Derek planned to propose to her, with a ring from his mother but remarked to Mark that the timing had to be right, otherwise she would bolt. Derek's plans to propose left his mind after he accidentally killed a patient. [[Richard Webber|Richard]] told Meredith about the ring, but the despondent Derek hit the ring into the woods, with a baseball bat. He apologized and she forgave him and he proposed properly to her later. They planned a wedding, but when they realized that Izzie had stage  cancer, they eventually gave their wedding to Izzie and Alex. With very little time to get married themselves, they went to the locker room, wrote down their vows on a Post-it note, and married each other.\n[[File:Postit.jpg|thumb|xpx|The post-it note that married Derek and Meredith.]]\nAfter their Post-it marriage, they referred to each other as husband and wife and in the days immediately after their wedding, they had sex frequently, while often getting caught in the act, in different places in the house, by those living there. Later, she found out she was pregnant. The shooting that happened after the death of a patient of Derek's, when the patient's husband shot numerous people, also shooting Derek was traumatizing for both of them, especially as Meredith miscarried because of the events of that day. She waited to tell him about this long after his recovery wondering how he would react. Then they proceeded to try to conceive, but they learned Meredith had a hostile uterus, which made it unlikely she would conceive naturally.\n\nEventually, the two did formally marry, as it would make it easier for them to legally adopt Zola, an African girl Derek got to know while treating her spina bifida. Derek engaged Meredith in his Alzheimer's clinical trial, trying to find a cure for her mother's disease. When Adele Webber became part of their trial, however, Meredith's emotions started to cloud her judgment, and as a result, she switched the placebo with the active medication, so Adele would get better. This caused Alex to become suspicious when he saw her acting weird. When Alex was drunk, he told Owen Hunt about this incident, who continued to alarm Derek and Richard. Derek then continued to become really angry at Meredith, accusing her of not knowing the difference between right or wrong and saying it wasn't any way to raise a child. It took them a long time to resolve these differences in their marriage and their separation caused trouble with Zola's adoption, for which each blamed the other. However, in times of crisis, they made up and all of them lived happily as a family after Alex, feeling guilty, managed to get them Zola back. Even after enduring the horrible plane crash, in which both her sister and his best friend died, and Derek's hand was severely injured, their bond only grew stronger and they helped each other. Meredith discovered she was pregnant with Derek's child. Though both of them were really happy, Meredith was very concerned due to her hostile uterus, but Derek remained optimistic, and she was still pregnant. During the \"superstorm,\" Meredith gave birth, via c-section, to a baby boy whom she named [[Derek Bailey Shepherd]] after both Derek and [[Miranda Bailey]].<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the birth of Bailey, Meredith and Derek enjoyed their time with their children. Eventually, Derek was offered a job with the president. At first, Meredith was upset as Derek promised her that she could kickstart her career but eventually grew not to mind. They were going to move to DC. but Meredith decided she wanted to stay, so Derek resigned from Grey Sloan.\n\nThe couple argued on and off over his new job and he moved to DC in the heat of the moment. He flew back and forth between Seattle and DC, putting a strain on their marriage. He eventually grew to realize that he was miserable without his family and wanted to be with them more than \"saving the world.\" Meredith also realized that she could live without him, but she didn't want to. They both became very happy once Derek moved back to Seattle. Meredith even told her friends that she had never been happier with her husband and kids. The two were lying in bed together the day before his death and Derek said that she was the one that saved him. On his way back to DC to resign, he got into a car accident and died.<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref> When Derek died, Meredith was pregnant with their third child, Ellis.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nAfter losing  patients to COVID-, Meredith had been more stressed out than ever, causing a breakdown and a trashed supply closet. Soon after, she was found in the middle of the hospital's parking lot, having collapsed. Suddenly waking up on a beach, Meredith tried to recollect what had just happened, but then a faint voice calls out to her in the distance. After staring long enough at the figure far away, she realizes that it's Derek, waving his arms and smiling. A shocked Meredith catches her breath in realization.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n[[Finn Dandridge]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith and Finn at \"prom\"]]\nFinn Dandridge was a veterinarian to [[Doc]], Meredith and Derek's dog. He met Meredith when Doc got sick and Meredith brought him in. He asked her out and she agreed, despite her and Izzie being celibate. They started a serious relationship and often had sleepovers. At the Seattle Grace prom, Finn said he had plans for his and Meredith's future. Meredith was happy and tried to make the relationship work. However, after an argument with Derek, Meredith ended up cheating on Finn with Derek. Finn found out, and albeit annoyed, he wanted to work past it. Meredith was glad, but she realized she couldn't choose between Finn and Derek, so she started dating them both at the same time until she chose. After a fierce competition, Derek decided to let Meredith go, but as soon as he let her go, Meredith realized she wanted to be with him. She broke up with Finn, who told her Derek was no good for her before he walked out for the last time. His nickname was \"McVet,\" as opposed to Derek's \"McDreamy.\"\n\n[[William Thorpe]]\nWhen William Thorpe and Meredith worked together on a patient, [[Brian Carson]], he flirted with her and asked to follow up with her. She initially didn't realize he was flirting, but once she figured it out, she went back and gave him her personal number.<ref>[[All Eyez on Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Will asks for Meredith's phone number]]\nHe then called her several times, but she didn't answer the phone. Still wanting to pursue her, Will came to the hospital and asked Meredith on a date in person.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith agreed to go get drinks, but panicked and canceled. However, he showed up at the hospital after she got out of surgery and offered to take her home. They got food and ate in the car, talking.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nOn their third date, Will and Meredith had sex. However, the morning after, Meredith yelled at Will, asking him to leave immediately. He later came to the house and she told him about Derek and said she thought she was ready, but she wasn't. He said he'd back off for a while and wait, but he'd call and then come back. He believed she was worth waiting for.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nNathan and Meredith were initially at odds, with her disliking him out of loyalty for Owen.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref> Due to Owen's stories, she began to notice he was prone to making rash medical decisions, and their opinions quite often differed. However, she has shown to be able to put her dislike aside so it wouldn't affect patients, or when Nathan told her his side of the story. When Meredith had a bad day, he confronted her about it in the parking lot. They started arguing and ended up having sex in her car.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> It happened four times, but Meredith didn't want him to get too attached to her. He claimed he knew they were just friends who had sex, but during Owen and Amelia's wedding, he smilingly looked at her, indicating he had started to feel more for her.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> Later at the wedding, Nathan and Meredith flirted and he asked her to dance, only for Maggie to interrupt and dance with him, leaving Meredith to watch the two.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref> Nathan continued to try to get closer to Meredith, and although she liked him, she kept brushing him off as she knew Maggie liked him too. Finally, Nathan showed up at Meredith's house, verbally confirming his feelings for her. Meredith lied to him, saying she didn't return the feelings, out of consideration for Maggie. Meredith also warned Nathan that Maggie was going to ask him out, which Nathan believed to be the reason Meredith rejected his pursuits.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex later noticed the way Meredith looked at Nathan, he encouraged her to go after him, but soon changed his mind when he and Nathan disagreed over a case. Meredith told Nathan that butting heads with Alex was not the way to pursue her. Later that day, Nathan told Meredith to stop listening to what people were telling her about him and listen to her own feelings for a change. He admitted he kept thinking about her and that he'd be all in if she wanted it to happen. He left her to think about it, and she decided that she wanted him to give her a reason to go for it. He spent an entire day trying to come up with her but instead told her about how he fell for her the first time he saw her. Meredith then told him to ask her out to dinner, which he did, and she said yes.\n\nHowever, their dinner plans were canceled when Maggie's mother's health took a turn for the worst and Meredith had to support Maggie throughout her mother's treatment. After Diane eventually passed away, Nathan and Meredith agreed that their timing wasn't right to start something between them and indefinitely postponed their dinner plans, since Maggie would heavily rely on Meredith in the near future.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Nathan and Meredith flirt at a dinner party]]\nMeredith and Nathan found themselves sitting next to each other on a plane, both heading to a conference. Meredith went to the bathroom, but Nathan followed her, intent on talking to her about their situation. They ended up having sex. After the plane landed and passengers were tended to, Nathan proposed that they get a hotel room and Meredith accepted.<ref>[[In the Air Tonight]], x</ref>\n\nNathan and Meredith began a relationship, which involved them telling Maggie that they were a couple, and Meredith began to open herself up more to Nathan. He slept over frequently, and Meredith even considered introducing Nathan to her kids over dinner. However, upon the discovery of Nathan's long-lost fianc\uee, Megan, who had been abducted  years ago when they were both in Iraq, Nathan and Meredith abruptly ended their relationship. Although Nathan tried to convince Meredith that he was still in love with her and that Megan didn't want to be with him, Meredith continued to send Nathan back to Megan because she didn't want Nathan to blow his opportunity to rekindle his romance with Megan. Eventually, Nathan moved to Los Angeles to start a new life with Megan. They ended on friendly terms with both of them thanking the other one for what they had meant in each other's lives.\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew drunkenly kissed Meredith, and she rejected his advances, though she told him she was flattered. The next morning, Meredith found herself dreaming about Andrew and was reminded of her thoughts when he apologized at the hospital for kissing her. Meredith continued to dream about Andrew as she began going on dates with the help of her matchmaker patient, [[Cece Colvin|Cece]]. Most of Meredith's dates did not end well while, unbeknownst to her, Andrew realized his feelings for her.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Andrew at Catherine's party]]\n\nWith the encouragement of Jo, Meredith asked out [[Atticus Lincoln]] for drinks, prompting Andrew to finally confess his feelings for Meredith. She told him she had to think about it, but that same day, they got trapped in an elevator during the wind storm. In the elevator, Andrew opened up to Meredith about his difficult childhood back in Italy under his famous surgeon father. Meredith revealed to Andrew that she speaks some Italian, and they grew closer, almost sharing a kiss before the elevator started working again. After working on a surgery together, Andrew proposed that he and Meredith go out on a date before they got interrupted by Link, who reminded Meredith that she had asked him out for drinks. Meredith realized that she was in another love triangle between Andrew and Link.\n\nSometime later, Meredith still hadn't made a decision, but she made a date with Andrew for Alex and Jo's New Year's Eve party. When she stood him up to monitor a patient, he began getting impatient over her indecisiveness. On Valentine's Day, Meredith asked Link out to dinner, but that night, Andrew took her up to the hospital roof for a drink, and the two shared their first kiss.\n\nBecause Maggie had dated Andrew years ago, Meredith wanted to get her approval before starting to date Andrew. When Maggie said she was fine with the relationship, Meredith allowed Andrew to take her out on a date, officially beginning their relationship. At Catherine Avery's party, Meredith and Andrew went off to make out in Jackson's guest room and were caught by Richard, exposing their relationship. Meredith also told Alex that she was dating Andrew, and Alex said that she should report their relationship to HR and that he hoped Andrew makes her happy. After Zola caught Andrew trying to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night, Meredith decided to tell her kids about her relationship with Andrew, which was received well. \n\nWhile working on a case together that involved Meredith committing insurance fraud so that a young immigrant girl could get a surgery she needed, Meredith spent the whole day thinking Andrew disapproved of her breaking the rules. However, he revealed that he was actually in awe of her bravery and that he was afraid of accidentally blurting out that he loves her. With this declaration, Meredith walked out without returning the sentiment and spent some time avoiding Andrew. She told Jo that the 'I love you' scared her because the last person she said it to was Derek. However, after Andrew took the fall for Meredith's insurance fraud and was put in prison, Meredith told him that, as much as it terrified her, she loves him too.\n\nDuring Meredith's trial, she lost her temper at one of the doctors on the panel, the one who'd killed Derek. This led Andrew to realize how much she had respected Derek, and although Meredith warned him not to compare, he didn't feel equal to her. He told her to take some time.\n\nCarina was concerned that Andrew might have the mania that their father had, explaining that that was why he went to jail for Meredith and why he was obsessing over Suzanne Britland's case. Meredith listened, as she already had concerns about Andrew's health, since he wasn't sleeping or eating. She went to Bailey who handed Suzanne's case to her. Meredith completely changed the treatment, which upset Andrew, but after receiving bone marrow test results, he and Lauren realized that Suzanne might have Still's disease. He administered steroids to her, which angered Meredith because if he was wrong, Suzanne would be killed. In the end, Andrew was right. Meredith confronted him about his reckless actions, which Andrew defended, and she brought up the point that he was acting like his father. He told her that he didn't need \"this\" and he didn't need her, breaking up with her for good.\n\n[[Cormac Hayes]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Hayes and Meredith getting coffee]]\nThey dated briefly after a long period of flirting until his son started having panic attacks due to his dating.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nick Marsh]]\nNick performed a kidney transplant at Grey Sloan as a visiting surgeon. When he was about to leave, he collapsed from his own recent kidney transplant and was admitted as a patient. Meredith treated him, and while they waited for his test results, they got to know each other. Later Nick thanked Meredith for saving his life. After work, Meredith told Alex that Nick made her feel something she hadn't felt since Derek, though it didn't matter because Nick lived in Minnesota.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\nYears later, Meredith saw Nick in passing at a restaurant in Minnesota when she was there to consult on another case. Later that night, he found her hotel, and they talked over drinks. He walked her back to her hotel room, and she didn't invite him in.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref> The next morning, he asked her out on a date. They went for dinner overlooking the river, where they talked about Meredith's new project.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith started officially working on the new project in Minnesota, she and Nick started dating. Meredith had trouble with the project's patient, Dr. David Hamilton, who is also on staff at Nick's hospital. Nick gave her advice on how to deal with Hamilton, and later that night, Meredith thanked Nick at dinner.<ref>[[Bottle Up and Explode!]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Nick and Meredith on a weekend getaway]]\nWhen Thanksgiving rolled around, Meredith was stuck in a hotel due to a snow storm. Nick was supposed to stay at his cabin, but when he heard that Meredith couldn't go home for the holidays, he turned around and joined her at her hotel. They ordered room service and spent the night before heading to his cabin the next day.<ref>[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]], x</ref>\n\nDuring one of her trips to Minnesota, Nick asked Meredith to help remove a tumor on one of his patients, but when things started to go wrong, Meredith found out that the patient was actually one of Nick's old friends, the one who had donated a kidney to Nick. She asked Nick to leave the OR because of the conflict of interest. They talked and made up after the surgery.<ref>[[Today Was a Fairytale]], x</ref> They kept dating, flying back and forth between Minnesota and Seattle to see each other. During one trip, Nick operated on a patient at Grey Sloan at Meredith's request, and afterwards, she introduced him to Maggie and Amelia.<ref>[[Living In a House Divided]], x</ref> After Meredith was offered a job in Minnesota, Nick offered that she stay and he move to Seattle to be with her. She started to get angry with him, claiming that she should be able to move and not be stuck at Grey Sloan. Because of the troubles with the teaching program at Grey Sloan, the two decided to stay for a couple weeks until the program was saved and then move to Minnesota.<ref>[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]], x</ref> \n\n\n[[Zola Grey Shepherd]]\n[[File:x-.png|thumb|xpx|Meredith bonds with Zola.]]\nMeredith and Derek met Zola when she was brought to the hospital for an operation as part of Alex's program. The couple had recently been told that Meredith had a hostile uterus and conceiving a child would be hard. Derek immediately bonded with Zola and suggested adoption. Meredith took a little longer to bond but eventually couldn't help falling in love with the child. However, Derek found out that Meredith tampered with his Alzheimer's trial just as the couple was granted temporary custody of Zola. When the social worker on their case, Janet, discovered that Meredith and Derek weren't living together, Zola was taken away from them for a time, during which Meredith and Derek rekindled their relationship. They were given a date to see a judge about the adoption after Alex went to the judge directly. That date was subsequently canceled and Janet told them that it was unlikely that it would end in their favor and suggested that they move on. Then, one night after a long day of work, Janet showed up at their door with Zola and told the couple that she was theirs.\n\n[[Derek Bailey Shepherd]]\nMeredith and Derek's son was a surprise to both because an OB/GYN had described Meredith's uterus as hostile. Meredith surprised Derek with a 'the world's best big sister' t-shirt for Zola to tell him she was pregnant. Meredith went into labor during the superstorm and had to have a C-section after injuring herself earlier from a fall on the stairs. With the lights out, Bailey performed the surgery, and to thank her, Derek and Meredith decided to name their son after her.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref> When Meredith visited her dad as he was dying, she told him Bailey said \"funny\" before saying something.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ellis Shepherd]]\nEllis was conceived before Derek's death. During her birth, Meredith was bleeding heavily. Zola called an ambulance, saving her. When Meredith visited her father before his death, she told him Ellis was really into hip-hop.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\n[[File:.Breakfeast.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith makes Lexie some breakfast.]]\nAlthough Meredith originally hated Lexie, she quickly realized that although she had reason to hate the idea of her, she had no reason to hate Lexie herself. Initially, she didn't like the way Lexie followed her around and seemed envious of her rapport with Derek. She claimed that Lexie was someone she never wanted to know, even denying that Lexie was her sister. However, after Bailey explained that Lexie probably thought she hated her, because of their family links, and after a traumatic day when Cristina brought Lexie home with her, Meredith made an effort to bond with her so they danced and drank tequila. The next morning, Meredith even tried to make breakfast for her and Lexie was so enthusiastic that she ate it, despite knowing she would have an allergic reaction. Lexie and Meredith didn't get too close, both having two different sets of friends, but they did eventually become friends which was made easier with the presence of [[George O'Malley]] who was good friends with both of them. Lexie gave up the apartment that she and George had rented, and moved into the attic of Meredith's house, where she occasionally bemoaned the fact that she didn\ut have a proper room instead. They later become so close, that Meredith gave Thatcher a piece of her liver because Lexie asked her to and she doesn\ut want her sister to feel the loss of her father, something of which she had experienced herself. She also sat with Lexie for  hours, after she has a PTSD breakdown and had to be committed to the psychiatric ward, against her will. And when Lexie got jealous over how April was all chummy with Meredith, she told her the reasons for that, and the fact that \"you're not crazy, you're a Grey and you're my sister, Lexie.\" At the end of Meredith's residency, Lexie died after the plane crash because she was stuck under the debris. Upon hearing of her death, Meredith cried hysterically.\n\nLater, Meredith obsessed over saving a patient's life when she had the same injuries as Lexie after being crushed by a car. At the end of the day, Meredith was talking to Cristina and simply said that \"Lexie's dead.\" From that, it appeared that Meredith had accepted the fact that Lexie was gone and was at peace.\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\n[[File:Ellissaysgoodbye.jpg|thumb|left|px|Ellis tells Meredith to be extraordinary.]]\n\nEllis Grey was the mother of Meredith Grey. Their relationship was strained due to Ellis's devotion to Richard Webber and her work, often forgetting about Meredith. Meredith was a rebellious teenager and she drank excessively and partied during college. However, while traveling in Europe, she received a call and was told that her mother had Alzheimer's. Meredith was made to look after Ellis and keep her secret from the rest who knew her. Ellis would rarely recognize Meredith but one day she woke up and was lucid, but it wouldn't last long, she found herself very disappointed in her daughter who was no longer driven, just \"happy.\" However, before she died, Meredith saw Ellis in a vision and Ellis hugged her and told her she was extraordinary and to continue being extraordinary. Later, Meredith found her mother's old diaries and used them to get to know who her mother was and she realized that she liked her and her mother was quite similar to her best friend, Cristina Yang.\n\n[[Thatcher Grey]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Thatcher apologizes to Lexie and Meredith.]]\nDue to Ellis and Richard's affair, Thatcher left Ellis and Meredith when Meredith was very young. Ellis asked him not to visit and Meredith did not see him again until she was in her thirties and she discovered he had another family. His wife Susan persisted in trying to get them to bond and they began to but when Susan died in surgery, Thatcher blamed Meredith, even going so far as to slap her across the face and asked her not to attend the funeral. Weeks later he arrived back at Seattle Grace and told her he was sorry and so proud of her but Lexie later informed her that he only said it because he was drunk and he did it all the time. Thatcher went into a program and he started making amends. He asked Meredith and Lexie to forgive him, Lexie hugged him and Meredith congratulated him and said good luck and then left the office they were in. Several months later, Thatcher came into Seattle Grace vomiting blood. He was found to have cirrhosis of the liver. He was told that to be put on the transplant list, he had to be sober for at least a year, but he had only been sober for  days. Lexie was not a match for her father's liver, but Meredith was. Willingly, she offers up her liver, not for Thatcher, but for Lexie's sake. Meredith then spent several weeks at home in bed, recovering from the transplant operation. When Thatcher quietly returned to the hospital, with bouts of pain, neither Grey knew, until Miranda Bailey informed them of his check-in. When he revealed that he had a young girlfriend, Meredith was actually happy for him and had to talk to Lexie, who was not too pleased with that discovery. Meredith later visited him in his house upon finding out he had less than a few days to live, and they talked until he passed away.\n\n[[Susan Grey]]\nSusan Grey was the second wife of Meredith's father, Thatcher. After Ellis Grey died, Susan reached out to Meredith and after a rough start, Susan and Meredith bonded. Susan would wash her clothes and make dinner for her and was like a surrogate mother to her. However, she came to Seattle Grace with the hiccups and she died during a relatively easy procedure, due to complications.\n\n[[Doc]]\n[[File:IzGeorgeMerDoc.jpg|thumb|right|px|Meredith and Izzie play with Doc.]]\nDoc was Derek, Addison, and Meredith's dog. She and Izzie rescued him from a shelter and brought him back to their home. Doc was very playful, but he became too much for Izzie and George who quickly demanded that he leave. Due to Meredith's friendship with Derek, Derek and Addison agreed to take him in. After taken to a vet, Doc was diagnosed with bone cancer. When his cancer spread, he was put down and Meredith and Derek agreed to bury him in his favorite spot on Derek's land. During her near-death experience, the very first being she wanted to meet was Doc.\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nMaggie is Meredith's half-sister, daughter of Ellis Grey and Richard Webber. She was adopted as a newborn and moved to Seattle and got a job at GSMH to know more about her biological mother, whom she only knew by name. Meredith and Maggie were immediately in conflict at work. Eventually, it came out that Maggie was Ellis' daughter. Initially, Meredith didn't believe it. The next day, Meredith, helped by Alex, matched the information about Maggie's birth with what she remembered and was able to access about Ellis' hospitalization, and she had to admit that Ellis Grey was actually Maggie's birth mother. After that, Meredith and Maggie ignored each other, but Derek pushed Meredith to make the first move with Maggie (like he had done for Lexie), so Meredith showed Maggie the old diaries of her mother that correspond to the period in which Maggie was conceived.  As time went on, Meredith and Maggie grew closer and now they have a good relationship.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAmelia is Meredith's sister-in-law through her marriage with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]. Their relationship has been rocky since Derek's death. Meredith finds Amelia annoying and doesn't really like her, but they both care for each other as a real family does. Amelia moved with Meredith to her old house after Meredith sold her and Derek's house. Despite a fall-out that resulted in Meredith kicking Amelia out of the house, Amelia continued to watch over her when Meredith was attacked. Meredith, in turn, was there for her wedding and supported her running away before the ceremony. When Amelia was diagnosed with a tumor, Meredith supported her and sat by her side in recovery, as Amelia had refused to call any of her family members. At the start of the pandemic, Amelia was on maternity leave with her son, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] and she and Link cared for Meredith's kids while Meredith worked and continued when Meredith contracted COVID.\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\n[[File:Persons.jpg|thumb|right|px|Cristina calls Meredith her person.]]\n\nCristina bonded with Meredith instantly and their relationship grew, resulting in Cristina and Meredith becoming best friends and each other's [[Person(s)|person]]. They were known around the hospital as the 'Twisted Sisters.' As such, there is very little that the two of them do not know, about the other, since day one of their internships. Meredith frequently talks about her problems with Derek, to her, and all the talk about her and Derek, have been a sore point with Cristina, at least a couple of times. She became Cristina's maid of honor during both weddings to Preston Burke and Owen Hunt. Meredith and Cristina also have several sleepovers at each other's houses, sometimes in Meredith's bed with Derek in it. As well as being one of Cristina's pillars of support, during when she suffered from PTSD, as a result of the shooting.\n\nThey bonded over a complex case on their first day, but the relationship was put to the test after Meredith was chosen for a surgery, instead of Cristina. However, they overcame the obstacle and their friendship grew. After Meredith and Derek's break-up, Cristina protected Meredith by asking Derek to stay away. Outside the hospital, they would hang out at Joe's bar, and in the hospital, they would help each other, wherever possible. Cristina was often there for Meredith during her worst times and vice versa. Meredith was the only person who knew about Cristina's pregnancy, and Cristina about Meredith's. When Addison came to Seattle Grace, Izzie and Cristina stole a patient from psych to make her feel better and when Meredith was put on Erica Hahn's service, Cristina selflessly gave Meredith lots of advice on how to impress Hahn.\n\n[[File:Old, new, borrowed, blue.jpg|thumb|px|left|Cristina gives Meredith something old, new, borrowed and blue for her wedding.]]\n\nThey had their first big fight after Richard Webber blamed Cristina for knowing of the interns' secret meetings and Meredith did not defend her. Although Meredith at first refused to believe Cristina was ignoring her, she eventually accepted it. The two spoke to each other as little as possible, and when they did, they would argue with each other, Meredith even insulted Cristina by saying that to some people things came naturally, but Cristina was one of the people that had to practice. However, after Meredith broke down after attending the execution of a murderer, Derek brought her to Cristina and they made up. They began to bond over [[Ellis Grey's Journals|Meredith's mother's old diaries]] and Meredith found herself comparing Cristina to her mother. When Meredith announced her own wedding, she chose Cristina as her maid of honor.\n\nAfter a fight with Owen, Cristina showed up at Meredith's house. They laid on the floor and talked about her problems. When Owen came to Meredith's house looking for Cristina, Meredith said, \"I already fixed her.\" And Cristina went home with Owen. Also, when both of their husbands were angry with them, Derek at Meredith for tampering with his clinical trial and Owen at Cristina for wanting an abortion, they leaned on each other. Cristina stayed at Meredith's house, both of the men away, and helped take care of baby Zola. They would sleep in the same bed and have routines in the morning.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\n[[File:GeorgeMerSTimeOut.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Meredith apologize during a time-out.]]\n\nFrom the moment [[George O'Malley]] met Meredith, he fell in love with her. Meredith however, was in love with Derek Shepherd so she never really thought about George as more than a friend. Only a patient and George's best friend [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] knew how he felt about Meredith. After a small push from Izzie, George decided to tell Meredith how he felt. Meredith had had a very bad day at work so when George confessed his feelings for her, she thought that maybe George was her guy and she had just overlooked him. They proceeded to kiss but during sex, knowing it wasn't right, Meredith burst into tears. George was humiliated and furious and for weeks, he refused to speak to her. Eventually, he accepted her apology, but admitted that he was partly to blame too, he had known how she felt about Derek and knew that she didn't love George. Their friendship continued and he moved back to her house. When George discovered that he had to repeat his intern year, he drew away from his group of friends, but things soon went back to normal. Meredith and George's friendship continued and was strengthened, as she was his resident. On George's last day at Seattle Grace, he was hit by a bus after pushing [[Amanda]] out of its path. When he was admitted, nobody could recognize him. Meredith was his doctor and she defended him in front of some of the other doctors. After he traced \"[[]]\" on her hand, she realized it was him and had him rushed into the [[Operating Room|O.R.]] George later died, and she and the other doctors at Seattle Grace attended his funeral. As the janitor cleaned out George's cubby, as they \"need(ed) space,\" Meredith realized that what had happened was real and broke down in Derek's arms.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\n[[File:MerIzCristinax.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith gives Izzie her wedding.]]\nMeredith formed a close bond with Izzie on their first day and her relationship with Izzie grew more so when Izzie and George moved in with her. Initially, Izzie was not pleased to know that Meredith was in a relationship with Derek, as she felt that Derek would be favoring her over the other interns, and thus giving her a much better career prospect. She finally learned that Meredith actually loved Derek, and it was not a fling. When George and Meredith were fighting, Izzie told Meredith she would be siding with George if they had to choose sides but fortunately, Meredith and George's issues were soon resolved. Izzie felt close enough to talk to Meredith about her relationship with George and how he pecked her like a chicken and when she discovered that Izzie and George were dating, she supported them. After Izzie was diagnosed with cancer, and when the condition relapsed and Meredith was informed, she and Derek gave their wedding to Alex and Izzie. However, after Izzie left Seattle Grace when she was fired prior to the merger with Mercy West, Izzie refused to answer calls from any of her friends and only returned when a former teacher of hers was sick and sought Derek's help at Seattle Grace. She returned later on after Meredith called her and told her Alex might be moving on, the same night that Alex slept with Lexie. Meredith decided that they should keep it between the three of them. Later that night, Meredith found Izzie cleaning out her old room, ready to leave for good after Alex dumped her. Meredith begged her to stay because this was her home, but Izzie told her that it wasn't. It was just a place she worked at and she could find a new workplace. Meredith was left speechless and walked away.\n\n[[Alex Karev]] \n[[File:AlexMeredithThanksfortheMemories.jpg|thumb|right|px|Alex and Meredith talk.]]\nInitially, Meredith disliked Alex, after he insulted her on the first day of her internship, by calling her a nurse. But when he became Bailey's intern and Izzie made friends with him, Meredith gradually lessened her dislike of Alex. After discovering that Alex failed his board exams, Meredith helped him to study and they occasionally have heartfelt and meaningful conversations. When Izzie was revealed to be quite sick, Meredith offered her wedding to Izzie and Alex and Alex made her his best man for the wedding. When Izzie left the hospital after being fired, Meredith became a source of support. She rang Izzie to tell her to come back because Alex might be moving on, after witnessing Alex and Reed flirting and the next morning she found Lexie and Alex in bed together but advised them to keep it secret. There is no sexual attraction between the two, as shown when Meredith sits in the bathroom and has a girl talk with Alex. while he is in the shower. When Derek walks in and looks at the two of them, she explains by saying he's being a girl for her right now.\n\nHowever, that friendship may have run its course, seeing as how he had sold her out, while in a drunken stupor, to Owen Hunt, while the residents were all in the race for Chief Resident. Meredith subsequently confronted him, in a fit of anger, telling him that she probably will get fired and that she wanted him out of the house by the end of the day. And while he was actually updating the adoption agent, on the medical status of Zola, Meredith had the misconception that Alex was trying to ruin her chances of adopting the child.\n\nHowever, it appeared that with Alex's apology, they mended their fences and went back to their former relationship, as he was there to provide some physical support after Meredith learned that Zola had to be surrendered to Social Services for the time being. Cristina told Alex to help Meredith with trying to keep Zola from being taken from her because Meredith was the only one who \"gave a rat's ass\" about Alex. Alex also spilled to Cristina that she and Meredith were all he had and that they were his family, and that realization made him help Meredith and attempt to get Social Services to let Meredith keep Zola. With the departure of Cristina, Alex became Meredith's new \"person\" and the closest thing to a brother she had.\n\nAfter the death of Derek, Meredith left Seattle without telling anyone where she was going. Despite numerous calls from Alex, she refused to answer. She eventually FaceTimed him, saying that she and the kids were fine and she wished he would stop calling. When she later gave birth to [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], there was a problem and he was her emergency contact person, so the hospital called him and he came to San Diego to see her.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMeredith and Mark first met when Mark came to Seattle Grace to work on a patient. Mark didn't know that Meredith ''was'' Meredith and flirted with her and and soon as Derek saw, he punched him in the face. Mark and Meredith started talking about their problems as their common factors were that they were the Dirty Mistresses of Derek and Addison.\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Sadie returns to Seattle to Meredith.]]\nSadie Harris was Meredith's best friend and she too hated Ellis. Following her graduation from college, when Meredith was in her twenties, she left to go traveling around Europe for two months with Sadie where they partied and drank frequently and experienced some of the adventures of \"Death and Die.\" They had a big fight in Amsterdam, and though they made up and stayed friends, their friendship never truly recovered and they were never as close again. When Meredith received a call about her mother, she left Europe and went back to Seattle. Years later, Sadie made a surprise visit to Meredith's house and became an intern at Seattle Grace. Sadie and Meredith picked up their friendship as though no time had passed, causing Cristina to be extremely jealous. However, when George alerted the chief that Sadie did not seem to have much medical knowledge, she quit and asked Meredith to leave with her. But Meredith said she had a life now and could no longer be sleeping her way through Europe. Sadie told Meredith that the hospital had changed her, but the latter replies that wasn't true: it simply changed what she wanted, and now she wanted to stay in Seattle Grace. Then Sadie left.\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nJackson moved to Seattle Grace through the merger with Mercy West. At first, Meredith did not like Jackson very much. Later, when she found out he was related to Harper Avery, she felt empathy for him. They became friends because she knows what it feels like to have a famous relative. Jackson and Meredith have developed a nice friendship and they are usually nice and happy around each other.\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nWhen April first came to Seattle Grace, Meredith did not approve of her. When April came back after being fired, Meredith liked her even less, because she was way too friendly to Derek. Later, when Derek got shot, Meredith said that April didn't have the right to cry because of Derek, but she told Meredith that Reed, her best friend died. Meredith ended up comforting April, creating a bond. Later, Meredith let April and Jackson move into her house, and she admitted to liking April more and more, after she went off on a tirade, after being continually teased for being a virgin the whole day. Meredith and April appeared to have a relatively friendly relationship, with April often turning to Meredith for advice, and Meredith genuinely being kind to her.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n[[File:CallieClaimsMeredith'sPanties.jpg|thumb|right|px|Callie claims Meredith's panties to protect her.]]\nAlthough Callie and Meredith were friends, they were never great friends. Meredith allowed Callie to move into her house for a while and Callie saved her from embarrassment at work and gave her advice about her dog, but Meredith was better friends with Izzie, who disliked Callie, so she often sided with Izzie in arguments. After George and Callie divorced, Callie moved in with Meredith's best friend, Cristina, so she and Callie bonded a bit more and both of them protected her from Owen Hunt when they thought he might hurt Cristina, after he choked her, while he was asleep. Callie played a big part of Meredith's career at the end of her residency, helping her study for the surgical boards that all th years take, helping Meredith pass. Callie and Meredith also have the common bond of being mothers, which has helped their friendship a great deal. Meredith also helped Callie with her separation from Arizona, the custody hearing, and even comforted her after she lost sole custody of Sofia to Arizona.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\n[[File:RichardandMeredithForgiveEachOther.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Richard forgive each other.]]\nMeredith Grey and [[Richard Webber]] had a very strained relationship for a very long time. He was the main cause of her parents' divorce and because of him, she was always cast aside. Upon coming to Seattle Grace, they acted civilly, but there were issues under the surface. Because he had been so close to Ellis, he felt close to Meredith, and he was close to her as a child and she thought that he thought he was her father. After she started disregarding his authority, Richard realized that although he was not a bad man, he was the bad man in her story. Richard started becoming frustrated with Meredith and even more so when he looked at her and was frustrated to see [[Ellis Grey]] inside her, the woman whom he loved but had almost ruined his marriage. He never looked Meredith in the eye and eventually, Derek Shepherd spoke to them both. He told Richard that he was the most professional man except for when it came to Meredith Grey, who he didn't always treat as a colleague. Richard apologized to Meredith for his actions in the past, he had been aware that she had grown up alone but never tried to stop it. The two forgave each other and it was proven by his fatherly behavior towards her during her solo surgery and her offering him the diaries of her mother. Meredith later tells a shooter that he should kill her because she is the closest thing Richard has to a daughter. Most of the doctors in the hospital acknowledge Richard and Meredith's relationship, often getting her to use her dead mommy connections to get something.\n\nMeredith also helped get Richard and Catherine back together after their fight.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nMeredith and Owen have had a turbulent relationship, as they have often clashed over Cristina, whom they both care about very much. In the beginning, Meredith was supportive of Owen and Cristina's relationship, but after he strangled Cristina during a PTSD nightmare, she gave him the cold shoulder and kept him away from Cristina. After they got back together, she was civil to Owen for Cristina's sake, although the two shared a few arguments over how to handle Cristina, as Meredith claimed to know her better than Owen did. The cold peace between them finally came to a stop when Meredith learned that he had cheated on Cristina, which resulted in her despising him for a long time. However, Cristina made her accept that she would decide her fate with Owen herself, and Meredith would just have to deal with it. Afterward, her relationship with Owen got better, and upon Cristina's departure, she considered Owen as her friend and promised to be his person for Cristina. That promise soon came to use, as Nathan Riggs' arrival to the hospital caused Owen to become moody and isolated, prompting a worried Meredith to turn to his mother, who revealed her the truth behind Owen's mood.\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nWhen Meredith was publishing her abdominal wall transplant, she wanted to put Jo's name on the paper, but she also needed a picture, and Jo couldn't give a picture because then [[Paul Stadler|Paul]] would find her, so she asked Meredith to take her name off of the article. From that point on, Meredith was very protective of Jo and was even nice to her when [[Alex Karev|Alex]] asked. Then when Paul surprised Jo at the hospital, Meredith was there to comfort her and to keep her safe from Paul. She comforted her by saying \"You're Jo Wilson. I know exactly who you are.\" Meredith kept Alex from Paul, so Alex didn't kill him, and Meredith sat with Jo while she was signing the divorce papers. She also protected her when Paul came back and was threatening Jo for talking to Jenny, Meredith \"called security\" even though the phones weren't working. After that, when Meredith was dealing with the mini spleens in [[Judy Kemp]], Jo wished that a mini-spleen situation would happen for a useful organ, which gave Meredith the idea for her contest entry: mini livers. Since Jo helped find an important piece, she put Jo as her partner for the contest, and they created their mini livers together. After Jo's return to the hospital, Meredith has taken on a sisterly role to Jo, helping her out whenever she needs help.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\n[[File:IntoYouLikeATrainMerBailey.jpg|thumb|left|px|Bailey addresses a drunken Meredith.]]\nBailey was Meredith's resident and had earned the nicknamed \"The Nazi\" before Meredith had started at Seattle Grace. She rarely got involved with people and their problems, unless it affected their work. When [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] found out about Derek and Meredith's relationship, she didn't speak to Meredith and would punish her, by sending her nonsurgical tasks, to even up the playing field when she felt that Derek was favoring her. However, after their break-up, when Derek tried to talk to Meredith, Bailey grew protective and told him not to, that Meredith was hurt and he would just make it worse. Bailey taught Meredith and the interns with a tough-love method. And as the interns became residents, Bailey became friendlier to them, often dispensing advice and chastisement when needed, while still managing to maintain her fearsome professional reputation as a doctor and general surgeon. She attends Derek and Meredith's Christmas dinner to impress her father, and shows a motherly protection over Meredith.\n\nHowever, upon learning of Meredith's tampering with Derek's trial, she voices her strong disapproval of her, as evidenced from her interactions with Meredith, when she got fired, and the Chief, when asked to write a recommendation letter for her.\n\nWhen a storm hit the city, Meredith went into labor and had started bleeding internally after giving birth. All of the surgeons were busy except for Bailey, who at the time was not operating because of her recent MRSA scare, but ultimately decided to save Meredith. Meredith's baby was named after Bailey.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\n[[File:AddisonhugsMeredithx.jpg|thumb|right|px|Addison hugs Meredith.]]\nWhen Addison came to Seattle Grace although she wanted Derek back, she was civil to Meredith and even defended her in front of a mislead patient. In a scrub room, Addison told Meredith that if there was even a chance that Derek still loved her then she wasn't leaving Seattle but she would if he didn't. Derek chose Addison over Meredith, but when Derek and Meredith decided to be friends, Addison tried to be friends with her, too. The three stayed friends, even taking in Meredith's dog, but Addison sometimes felt a tension between the two and realized that everybody knew Derek loved Meredith, except for Derek and Meredith. She and Derek eventually divorced but after a short while, she managed to have a friendship with both of them. The relationship was proven when she came back to Seattle for a visit and hugged Meredith, although she was quite annoyed, and quite tempted to kick her ass physically, after learning that Meredith was letting Derek go off with Rose.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhen Mark first met Meredith, he flirted with her and was punched in the face by Derek. Privately, she labeled him as \ucMcSteamy\ud, and Mark called her \"My Favorite Dirty Mistress,\" while she was high on morphine for pain management. But when he asked her out, she said no because she loved Derek. When Derek forgave Mark for breaking up his marriage and they resumed their friendship with him, Meredith too became friendly towards him, although Mark still threatened her, only half-jokingly, on her wedding day. He later dated her little sister against her wishes, which caused a fight between him and Derek. When the plane crashed and killed Lexie, both she and Mark were left shocked and distraught with Meredith crying hysterically and a depressed Mark had a heart complication.\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\nBecause Burke was dating Cristina, Meredith and Derek were often invited over to their house for dinner and vice versa. She tried to mediate and fix things between Cristina and Burke, after Cristina went to Chief Webber about the tremor in Burke's hand, but to no avail. However, Burke left Cristina on the day of their wedding and there was never any contact between them again.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\nWhen Erica Hahn was hired at Seattle Grace, she almost immediately assigned Meredith to her service in order to see if Meredith had any of her mother's skill. She was impressed by Meredith but when Meredith lied and said she had performed a certain surgery when she hadn't, Hahn told her that if she did it again, she'd never let her operate in her OR again.\n\n\nAfter attending medical school, Meredith secured a spot at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] as a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] and moved from Boston to her mother's house in Seattle. She attended [[Dartmouth College]].\n\nBecause of her mother's reputation, Meredith was often treated differently from other doctors, sometimes favored and sometimes disliked. Meredith showed promise as an intern, she made a difficult diagnosis on her first day and during the rest of her internship, she assisted in several advanced procedures, particularly [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] cases.\n\nAfter correctly diagnosing a patient with a brain tumor, she approached Derek Shepherd with the idea of a clinical trial. On their thirteenth patient, they had a success and the clinical trial was published in a medical journal and named ''The Shepherd Method''. But she was not too pleased, to find that she was not mentioned in the article and was somewhat upset to hear from Derek that he was the one taking the risk, despite her doing all the work.\n\nSoon after, Meredith discovered numerous journals belonging to her mother, while she learned more about her and also picked up some surgical skills and even a doll from her past, Anatomy Jane, which helped her save a young girl.\n\nOn her wedding day, she was given a colon removal operation, from Derek, as her first solo surgery, as a wedding present. Without any intervention from other doctors, she successfully completed the surgery, despite Richard and Mark observing in the background. Richard Webber informed her that her mother would have been proud, while Meredith said that her mother was likely to have been glad that she didn't kill anyone instead.\n\nShe later also performed a solo neurological surgery by herself, as Derek, the attending doctor, was occupied by another patient in another OR. When Derek was setting up the Alzheimer's trial, Meredith was there to assist him. But she was not entirely pleased to find out that he chose Alex, over her, to help him. It was only later, that Alex explained that Meredith was more suited to be his assistant, as she had personal experience, in dealing with the patients and family. But when she tampered with the sample that Adele was supposed to get, Alex suspected that something was amiss. That culminated in him outing her, while he was drunk, and her being suspended, before being fired by the board. Richard took the fall for her, but she and Derek agreed that they shouldn't be close at work too, so Meredith decided to leave neurosurgery.\n\nElecting [[General Surgery|general surgery]] as her [[Surgery#Surgical Specialties|specialty]], Meredith passed the [[Board Certification|boards]] and is now the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[General Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. \n\nShe is also one of the Board Directors at Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\n\n*Meredith's Catch Phrases/Running Gags:\n**.

While they were operating, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] thought of alternatives to why Brooke might have driven off the bridge other than just snapping under the pressure. She suggested an insulinoma, a tumor on the pancreas which would cause an extra secretion of insulin, which explained all her symptoms, including the low blood sugar she had in the ER. They did a trauma whipple to repair the other damage while pathology reviewed her scans, looking for the tumor. They came up with nothing, but Meredith was still convinced it was there, so she looked by hand. It was small, about the size of the head of a pin, but it was there. They removed it and in recovery, they told her husband that all her symptoms, the fatigue, irritability, and stress, were all due to the tumor and now that they had removed it, she'd make a full recovery.\n\n\n\nMia lives with her parents and her brother, Parker.

Because he was so old, many people believed he was an attending when he was just an intern. Because he had trouble keeping up with the other interns, [[Alex Karev]], his resident, tried to dump him in the clinic, but they ended up working on the case together. [[Hunter Chapman]] came in with his mother, who suspected he was doing drugs. Norman sided with the mother, who insisted on a drug test. He later tried to get Alex to stop to explain a procedure to his mother before he did it. Afterward, Alex went to apologize to him, but Bailey told him not to apologize because he was an intern and he got in the way. He needed to learn his place. ''(\"[[Let the Truth Sting]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith and Norman were doing labs and discharges. They had a patient who was being discharged to hospice, so Meredith taught him the protocol for telling patients they were dying. They then went to [[Gretchen Bitzer]] to tell her that she was dying. She and Norman both cried. When they found out that Gretchen wasn't actually dying, they had to track her down because she left the hospital. Norman found her and brought her back. When [[Mark Sloan]] said he was planning to write up both Norman and Meredith, Meredith said that Norman was only an intern and she should be the only one written up. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nNorman came to Alex and said he was feeling under the weather. He wanted to go home, but Alex said he needed to suck it up if he wanted to be a surgeon. When Alex saw that Rebecca was back in town, he dismissed Norman to do his own thing. While Norman was helping with [[James Miller]], he started to feel queasy, but he thought it was because of the blood. Later, while in surgery, he collapsed. He'd had a stroke and was taken into surgery to remove the clot. After the clot was out, Norman woke up, confused. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n\nAfter his surgery, he told Alex that he'd wanted to go into psych, but he had a voice in his head telling him to go into surgery. After his stroke, he figured that his wife wanted him to be surrounded by surgeons when he had his stroke. He decided to transfer to psych because he believed the surgeons could all use a good shrink. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n\n\nNorman married Mary-Beth Shales and they had four children. According to him, when one of their children was straying from a good path, she knew right away. When Mary-Beth appeared to him in a dream, he made the decision to go into surgery instead of psych.\n\n\nDr. Shales was a pharmacist for thirty years. He was transferred from UCLA as an [[Internship|intern]], and assigned to [[Alex Karev|Dr. Alex Karev]] at Seattle Grace Hospital in the [[General Surgery|surgical program]]. Because of his age, he was often mistaken by patients as the senior doctor. He collapsed in surgery because of a stroke (causing [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Shepherd]] to operate and remove the clot). He believes that it was his wife watching over him that allowed him to be treated by some of the best surgeons in the world at the time of his stroke. He transferred and became an intern in [[Psychiatry|psych]].\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nNormanShales.png|[[Let the Truth Sting]]\nNormanShales.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\nNormanShales.png|[[Haunt You Every Day]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Norman Shales Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Norman Shales]]\n[[fr:Norman Shales]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shales, Norman}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Before that, she was a resident at [[Dillard Medical Center]], prior to its closure, who treated [[Derek Shepherd]] after his car accident.\n\n\n\nAs a child, Penny moved every two years due to her mother's job. ''(\"[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\")''\n\nShe hated high school, which she attributes to cheerleaders. ''(\"[[All Eyez on Me]]\")''\n\n\nPenny was one of the doctors who tended to Derek Shepherd when he came into the Dillard ER. She put in his chest tube and his thoughts indicated that he liked her, said she was smart. She wanted to order a head CT, but [[Paul Castello]] insisted that they didn't have time and they needed to take him into surgery to get his abdominal bleeding under control.\n\nWhile they were on the way to the OR, she made one final plea to get the CT, since he was stable. Paul again declined and they took Derek into surgery and started operating. When he became unstable, Paul finally remembered that he'd had a head laceration and had the anesthesiologist check his eyes, which revealed a blown right pupil. They paged the neurosurgeon, [[Dr. Cohn]], who said he'd be there in  minutes because he was at a dinner. Despite this, it took him an hour and a half to arrive. Penny called him out on this and he responded that they should have gotten a head CT and they would have paged him sooner. When she continued to say that he should have gotten there faster because Derek might have had a chance if he had, he kicked her out of the OR.\n\nShe went with Dr. Cohn to speak to Meredith about Derek's death and Meredith told them that the decision not to get a CT was a bad decision.\n\nWhen Meredith exited the hospital, Penny was on a bench outside crying. She went up to Meredith to apologize again, but Meredith told her that Derek was her one, the patient whose face she'll see every time she treats a patient. He'll haunt her and remind her that he died on her watch. It'll either make her a better doctor or she'll quit and Meredith says she doesn't get to spend what would have been the rest of Derek's life being a quitter and then sends her back inside because she's not saving any lives outside. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n\nLong after Derek's death, Penny began seeing [[Callie Torres]]. They dated for a while and Callie invited Penny to come to a dinner party at Meredith's with her. She and Meredith were both shocked to see each other when Callie and Penny arrived at the party. Penny did not know that Callie was good friends with Derek and Meredith and Callie did not know about Penny being a resident at the hospital Derek died in. ''(\"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\")''\n\nPenny tried repeatedly to get Callie to let them leave the party, but Callie, thinking it was just nerves about meeting Arizona and her other friends, insisted that Penny stay, even when Callie herself got called to the hospital. Meredith kept quiet about the connection to Penny, but it came out when Penny was asked about why she was transferring to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. The doctors were all shocked by the news and Penny left the house. Later, after coming back in to use the bathroom, Penny met up with Meredith, who had come back downstairs after going up to hide in her bedroom. Penny said she'd ask for a transfer so they wouldn't have to work together, but Meredith told her that she'd see her on Monday and not to be late. ''(\"[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\")''\n\n\nOn her first day at GSM, Penny was assigned to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] service. She helped Meredith treat [[Robert Matthews]], but Meredith critiqued her every step of the way and eventually kicked her off her service. However, after speaking to Richard, Meredith agreed to give Penny another chance and asked for her on her service for the rest of the week. ''(\"[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith continued to have Penny on her service, running her ragged. Penny eventually confronted Meredith, saying that she could hate her, but she hadn't let Penny quit, so she shouldn't quit either. And if Meredith wasn't going to teach her, she should let her go. Meredith later let her help with a kidney transplant. ''(\"[[Something Against You]]\")''\n\n\nPenny found Meredith after she was attacked by [[Lou]]. She helped treat her initial injuries and then followed her recovery. When Meredith had a panic attack after a visit with her kids didn't go well, Penny cut the wires holding the broken jaw together. Jackson yelled at her for it, but she defended that Meredith needed air and her jaw could be re-wired the next morning. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] came into the ER, Penny was given the case because of her relationship with Callie. However, she hadn't yet met Sofia. When Callie found out that Penny had treated Sofia without paging her, she claimed that Arizona wasn't comfortable with Penny meeting Sofia yet. Penny immediately went to Arizona to apologize, but Arizona said that she had no part in it and Callie had lied. Penny believed it was because she'd told Callie she loved her the previous night. Callie later told Penny they were on the same page and invited her to get ice cream with her and Sofia. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the opportunity came up for Penny to apply for the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]], she initially decided she didn't want to because she believed she didn't have a chance at it. However, she ultimately decided to apply after overhearing other residents dismissing her. She had support of several attendings and was given the grant, which funds a year of residential research at the Preminger Research Center. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\nWhen the time came to say whether or not she was accepting the grant, Penny consulted with Callie, not wanting to make a decision without talking to her first. After talking, they decided they'd both go to New York. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\n\nPenny testified on Callie's behalf at the hearing to determine who would receive custody of Sofia. Despite being flustered and unable to remember what grade Sofia was in or what she'd been wearing that day, she demonstrated knowledge of Sofia's likes and routine. After Arizona was awarded sole custody of Sofia, Penny tried to comfort Callie, but Callie pulled away from her. ''(\"[[Mama Tried]]\")''\n\n\nPenny wanted to delay her move to New York because Callie wouldn't be able to join her with Sofia. However, Callie told her it would just delay the inevitable resentment and broken promises if they tried long distance and they ended things. Penny then packed up her things and told Meredith she was accelerating her departure. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nPenny was dating Callie Torres. She was not aware of Callie's friendship with Meredith Grey until Callie brought her to a dinner party at [[Meredith's House]]. ''(\"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\")''\n\nAfter the dinner party, they didn't speak for a few days because Penny thought Callie was taking Meredith's side, though Callie said she was on both sides. However, after Penny's first day at Grey Sloan Memorial, they both agreed they were in it. ''(\"[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\")''\n\nPenny constantly being on Meredith's service upset Callie, which strained their relationship. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\nThey broke up briefly, but they met in a stairwell at work and Callie admitted to Penny that she missed her and Penny kissed her. ''(\"[[All I Want is You]]\")''\n\nOne night, as they were in bed getting ready to sleep, Penny told Callie she loved her. Callie replied, \"Thank you.\" The next day, after Penny treated Sofia, Callie told her that she was on the same page and she'd been there for a while, but she had a history of being on that page too early in the past, which is why she was hesitant. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\nWhen Penny won the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]], which would require moving to New York for a year, she didn't ask Callie to go with her, feeling it wasn't possible. However, Callie told her to do it and they decided to move to New York together with Sofia. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\nWhen Callie lost the case for sole custody, things quickly soured between her and Penny. Penny told Callie she wanted to wait to leave until things were good between them again, but Callie said it wouldn't work because she couldn't leave without Sofia and long-distance would fizzle out quickly. When Penny asked if they were breaking up, Callie said it would be best to end things now instead of dragging it out. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\nAfter Penny left, Callie was miserable, which led Arizona to decide to allow Callie to take Sofia to New York with her and have her for a greater part of the year, leading Callie to move to New York to be with Penny again. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\nThey broke up an undetermined time later, revealed when Arizona comments that she and Callie are both single and making each other smile again. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nHer mother is a petroleum seismologist, so they moved every two years.\n\n\nAfter starting work at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], Penny began to bond with the other residents, particularly [[Stephanie Edwards]], [[Jo Wilson]], and [[Ben Warren]].\n\n\n[[Paul Castello]]\nPaul, one of her co-workers, seemed to have little respect for her. Over her objections, he refused to take Derek for the head CT that might have saved his life. Derek's thoughts said that Paul didn't like Penny because she was smarter than him, even though she's younger, and probably because she's a woman. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nPenny had a rough start with Meredith during her first days at Grey Sloan Memorial. She was put under Meredith's service\uadespite hating her for \"killing Derek\". Meredith was asking her questions about procedures while they work on\ua[[Robert Matthews]]\uabut was being intimidated by her, being unable to answer her questions.\ua''(\"[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\")''\n\nAfter being reprimanded by Webber, Meredith started trusting Penny with procedures. However, she was giving her a lot of workload, causing Penny to call Meredith out.\ua''(\"[[Something Against You]]\")''\n\nPenny was seen talking to Meredith while they were on their way to save\ua[[Brian Carson]], seemingly asking to join the team but\ua[[Jo Wilson]]\uawas already going.\ua''(\"[[All Eyez on Me]]\")''\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nWhen Penny was hired to work at GSM, Amelia refused to work with her. However, they were forced to work together when [[Richard Webber]] scrambled the attending/resident pairs. After seeing Penny work on [[Griffin McColl]], Amelia admitted that she was a born neurosurgeon, which meant Amelia would have to start teaching her.\ua''(\"[[Odd Man Out]]\")''\n\n\nPenny was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Dillard Medical Center]]. However, when Dillard closed, she was [[Resident#Re-Matching|re-matched]] to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to continue her residency. She's currently represents [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] at the Preminger Research Center.\n\n\n*Although her name was not mentioned in [[How to Save a Life]], closed captioning and subtitles displayed her name as Edie, however, she was re-introduced in [[Old Time Rock and Roll]] as [[Callie Torres|Callie's]] girlfriend named Penny.\n*She was in college before she ever tried macaroni and cheese.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n*She liked physics.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxPenny.png|[[How to Save a Life]]\nxPenny.png|[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[Something Against You]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[The Sound of Silence]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[All I Want is You]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[My Next Life]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[All Eyez on Me]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Odd Man Out]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[I Wear the Face]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[There's a Fine, Fine Line]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Trigger Happy]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Mama Tried]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[At Last]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Penelope Blake Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Penny Blake]]\n[[de:Penelope Blake]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blake, Penelope}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

[[Jackson Avery]] was called to the door of the OR to be informed about the situation and was told to wait until they were done operating to tell the other doctors and lockdown in the OR.

Randy agreed and Janell was put into a coma.\n\nMeredith noticed that Janell was having a hemolytic anemia, which indicated an autoimmune response. Meredith figured out that she had a teratoma. They found a mass on her lung that she believed was the teratoma, so they scheduled surgery to remove it. However, after they removed it, pathology determined that the mass was a benign granuloma, so the search for the teratoma continued.\n\nThe most likely location of the tumor was in her ovaries, so they went back to Randy to ask him about it and he said that Janell wanted kids, so he refused to let them remove her ovaries.\n\nIn surgery, they noticed a lot of adhesions on her right ovary, which could indicate a tumor, so they removed the right to examine it for microscopic tumors. When it came back clean, they removed her other ovary, effectively sterilizing her.\n\nThe pathologist looked at the specimen.

He had end-stage renal disease and had spent  months on dialysis waiting for a donor. The wait was long because he needed a six-antigen match. During his pre-op exam, they discovered a large bump on the top of his head. They hoped it was minor and wouldn't affect the transplant, but it turned out to be osteosarcoma. The tumor had good margins, but removing it would leave a large gap in his skull and skin and that would disqualify him for a transplant.

Meredith initially believed they should amputate, but when she found a viable finger, she changed her mind and they made steps to save his hand. When they talked about cutting through the grinder to free his hand, his brothers objected, saying it was expensive. They said they had to take it apart every night to clean it anyway, so Callie let them take it apart to free Dominic's hand. To buy Dominic more time, they applied a tourniquet above the grinder.\n\nOnce they got it apart, Callie told his brothers to leave while they turned back the auger and released Dominic's hand. They didn't leave right away and when his hand was pulled out, they both passed out on the floor. His hand was severely injured and only two of his fingers were left attached. While Meredith and Callie were in the OR working on Dominic's hand, Meredith determined that one of his amputated fingers was still viable and could be reattached, but Callie said the thumb wasn't, so Dominic would be better off with a prosthetic as the thumb is responsible for % of hand function.

Tyler later blackmailed Cristina into giving him an electrical appliance by lying to Burke's mother, Jane Burke, and telling her that Cristina was in surgery.\n\n\nTyler worked as a surgical nurse for at least four years at Seattle Grace and helped out the interns a lot.

The next morning, Jorge's sight had returned, but an MRI to check for bleeding revealed a tumor on his hypothalamus. Jorge was given his options. He could either have - quality years with focused radiation or he could have the tumor almost completely removed, which would give him - years, but since the tumor was where his personality lived, there was a chance he'd lose his memories and his personality.
