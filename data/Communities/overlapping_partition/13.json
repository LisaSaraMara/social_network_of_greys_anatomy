Laurie went into labor while her OB was on vacation, so [[Arizona Robbins]] stepped in to deliver the babies, but before delivery, she noticed something odd on the ultrasound. She had [[Alex Karev]] paged urgently and delivered the babies, who were both severely jaundiced. The babies were then taken to CT, where it was revealed that each of them had a large liver tumor.\n\nThe doctors informed Mason and Laurie of the situation and they decided to be tested to see if either of them was a match and could donate. Mason was a match, but Laurie was not, meaning they could only save one baby. They worried about how they would choose until Alex stepped in and said that they wouldn't have to choose; he'd be making the choice. He ran tests and compared their conditions, but the twins came out tied, so he decided that he needed to open both of them up and look directly at their tumors before he could make the choice. After the twins were opened, he evaluated each of them again and decided that Emma had a better chance, so she received the liver, while he tried resecting Daniel's tumor.

You're one of the Seattle Grace Five. [You survived a plane crash] And a car crash. And a shooting. You might be immortal. You mastered one of the most exclusive specialties basically overnight, and then you took Herman's job and her eyesight. You have screwed dozens of interns, and you got them all fired. You speak really fast, like superhuman fast. You have a weird name... They say you have two legs, and you are only pretending that one is amputated. For the parking space.|'''[[Stephanie Edwards]]''' to '''[[Arizona Robbins]]'''}}\n\n'''Arizona Robbins''' is the former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Fetal Surgery]], an [[Attending]] [[Pediatric Surgery|Pediatric Surgeon]], and a board director at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She is the ex-wife of [[Callie Torres]] and the mother of [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]]. To better the happiness of her daughter, she decided to move to New York to be closer to Callie.\n\n\n\nArizona was named after the battleship, the U.S.S. Arizona, on which her grandfather served and died after saving  men. She came from a military family, her father being a Colonel in the United States Marine Corps. Her brother later joined the army and died because there weren't enough doctors.\n\nWhen she was growing up, she moved every  months due to her family's involvement in the military. Whenever they would get somewhere new, her father would take her skating first thing. Wherever they ended up, the skating always stayed the same, which made her feel safe. She did it in college, in med school, and when she first got her job at Seattle Grace. She noticed the skating made the kids feel at ease, too.\n\nThe way she described her upbringing is that she was \"..raised to be a good man in a storm. Raised to love my country. Love my family. Protect the things I love.\" It led her to be patriotic as well as loyal and dedicated in her adult life, especially to her family.\n\nShe learned to act tough when she had to, due to her name, and she never had to \"come out\" to her parents because it wasn't a shock to them. She had a poster of Cindy Crawford in her room and she wasn't looking at her beauty mark. She never brought any boys home and when she finally brought home a girl, Joanne, her mother wasn't surprised. She had expected her father to react by saying \"How fast can you get the hell out of my house?\" but instead he asked her \"Are you still who I raised you to be?\".\n\nShe attended [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]].\n\nDuring her [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]], she was a \"full-on horror show\". She was later chosen as Chief Resident for her th and final year of residency.\n\n\nAfter completing her [[Resident|residency]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], Arizona was hired as a [[Fellow|surgical fellow]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace Hospital's]] [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery department]]. When [[Attending#Department Head|head]] pediatric surgeon [[Jordan Kenley]] died, Arizona was promoted to department head and took over Dr. Kenley's cases. She worked together with [[Alex Karev]] and [[Miranda Bailey]] on [[Jackson Prescott]], a young boy dear to Bailey. They disagreed when Arizona wanted to change Dr. Kenley's course of treatment. Arizona thought it wasn't working, though Bailey fully supported Kenley's plans. Arizona agreed to follow Kenley's course of treatment for another day, but did want to explore other options. She told Bailey they'd meet in the OR as she rolled off on her Heelys, which made Bailey start to dislike her.\n\nThe dislike grew in the OR where Arizona said that it was a miracle that Jackson was still alive, as he should've been on the transplant list a year ago. Behind Arizona's back, Bailey complained about her to Richard, though he didn't really listen and he assured her that Arizona was the best. When Arizona told Bailey after surgery to put Jackson on the transplant list, Bailey asked to get a second opinion. Arizona gave her [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Wish You Were Here|Norman McCale's]] number, saying he'd totally agree with her plan. Bailey said there was no need to snap, but Arizona found there was. Arizona said that she got that Bailey kept on second guessing her as she liked and trusted Kenley, but she said that she was not the problem. She asked Bailey to start thinking about Jackson instead of her, as he needed all the time he could get. Bailey later realized that Arizona was \"okay\", which she also told the Chief, to whom she had earlier complained.<ref>[[Wish You Were Here]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] was asked by another hospital at Boise to send over a couple of surgeons to assist the surgeons at Boise with a surgery to separate conjoined twins, a surgery the doctors in Seattle had successfully completed [[This Magic Moment|earlier that year]]. Originally, Alex was on the plane to Boise to represent [[Pediatric Surgery|Arizona's department]], but then Arizona heard that he had chosen to take the fellowship at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]] instead of staying in Seattle to study under her. She was furious, scolded him and yelled at him, saying that he could no longer represent the hospital. She took his place on the plane and pulled him off every single pediatric case before she left. During their flight, the back of the plane broke off and the plane crashed in the woods.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after the crash, Arizona was lying next to the front part of the wreckage and she kept on screaming until Cristina yelled at her to shut up. Arizona then points Meredith, Mark, and Cristina into the direction of a consistent banging sound, which turned out to be Lexie, who was crushed under a part of the plane, banging a belt against the metal. While the others went away, Arizona sat up and tore open her pants, revealing she had an open femur fracture. She was panicking when the pilot asked if there was someone there. He told her he couldn't move. She told him her name and instructed him not to move, as he could injure himself even more. She informed him that she thought they were all alive and then started laughing because she was in shock. When he told her he couldn't feel his legs, she suddenly stopped laughing, and he said he knew that was bad. \n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Arizona splinting her leg.]]\n\nLater on, Cristina came back and sought supplies to help splint Arizona's leg. Arizona told her she could do it herself, which she did, but asked Cristina to take a look at Jerry, the pilot of the plane, who was found to be paralyzed. When Cristina yelled, \"I found it!\", Arizona thought she found the first aid box, but Cristina was talking about her shoe. Arizona then looked at her hand, and noticed there was dry blood on it. She then coughed up blood again. In the evening, Cristina, Meredith, and Derek dragged Mark's body back to the front part of the plane. Mark then informed Arizona that Lexie died. When Arizona was asking Jerry about the  hours he mentioned earlier, a helicopter passed over the woods, and she screamed along with the others, but it didn't help. While she was out in the woods, Alex left her a message to tell her that he chose to go to Hopkins to see if he was something without her around. When it got dark, Mark told her that he was ready to go to Lexie, but Arizona convinced him to fight to stay alive as she, Callie, and Sofia were waiting for him. Back in Seattle, Callie was dressed in sexy lingerie, waiting for Arizona to come home.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:xArizonaRobbins.png|thumb|px|Arizona makes Callie promise not to cut off her leg.]]\nAfter four days in the woods, Arizona and the others were taken to the hospital in Boise, where scans were taken of her leg. While the Chief in Boise recommended amputation, Arizona interfered and told Owen she gave no one permission to cut off her leg. Following her request to go to Callie, she and the others were sedated and put on a plane to Seattle, where Callie started taking care of the infected leg. After Bailey's visit with Sofia, Arizona realized her future was uncertain. The thought of an amputation came back in her head, which scared her so much that she urged Callie to come up with a plan to save the leg and she made her promise that she wouldn't cut if off, and so Callie did. Callie did come up with a plan to save the leg and although Owen mentioned a prosthetic would give Arizona a much better quality of life, the surgery was planned. However, when Alex visited Arizona, she started crashing because of the infection. He did everything he could, but she kept deteriorating. He went to Callie, who was in the middle of the surgery on Derek's hand, and she ordered him to cut off the leg and do his best at it. After the surgery, Callie held Arizona's hand until she woke up.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nAfter her left leg was amputated, Arizona became depressed. When Mark died  days later, Callie went into her bedroom, where Arizona was just sitting in bed, and she told Arizona that she couldn't keep doing things alone. She yelled at Arizona to get out of bed and \"snap at out this\". While Callie was ranting over how Sofia lost a parent and she lost her best friend, Arizona turned towards Callie. \"Snap out of this? Snap out of ''this''?\" Arizona said while she revealed her residual limb. \"How the hell am I supposed to snap out of this when you cut off my leg?\" Arizona says. She then turns her back towards Callie again, while Callie left her alone.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Arizona blames Callie for making her decisions.]]\n\nSome time later, Callie told Arizona, who was back at home in a wheelchair, about the settlement the survivors were offered by the plane company. While she kept on talking about how good the settlement would be for them, Arizona ignored her and didn't respond, and even pulled away when Callie tried to make physical contact with her. The next day, Callie told Arizona she should come to the settlement meeting to make her own decision about whether or not she wanted to take it. Arizona started sniping that she didn't need to be there, as Callie was there and that Callie took other decisions for her, too, like the one to cut off her leg. Callie came home to get Arizona for the meeting anyway, only to find her sitting in a pool of her own urine in the bathroom, having fired the homecare nurse for not liking her. Arizona blamed Callie that Callie's decision to cut off her leg made her unable to go the toilet on her own. Against her will, Callie picked her up and put her in the shower, and made it clear that Arizona's problems were her problems too, as they lived together. Without Arizona, she went to the meeting, where it was decided not to take the settlement.<ref>[[Love the One You're With]], x</ref>\n\nArizona agreed to go to the hospital to fit a prosthetic, but only if no one knew about it, though Callie accidentally told Alex because she thought he had seen Arizona. Meanwhile, Arizona was introduced to her prosthetist, [[David Moore]]. He took a look at her residual limb, commenting that it was healing well as there was no scar tissue. Later, he was putting plaster bandages on Arizona's residuum when Callie came in, thinking Arizona would be ready. Arizona yelled at her for not checking her voicemail, where she left her a message. The next day, Arizona tried on her first prosthetic. Without checking it first, she told him it was fine. He told her not to rush and tried to get her up to take a few steps, but she yelled to let her go when he tried to help her up. He made it clear she still needed help with her leg and that she should let the people in her corner help her. He then went away to do other work and left her alone to give her some time. While she was alone, she tried to take a few steps when Alex came in. She fell, but he caught her. He then took a look at her left leg too and told her they needed her back in her department. \"I'm trying,\" she says. Before he left, he told her Callie was trying too. When David got back, Arizona was standing in front of a mirror. She then gave him some remarks about the prosthetic and he told her he'd do something about it. At the end of the day, Arizona allowed Callie, who was ready to go back to Mark's place, to sit next to her on the couch to watch American Bake Off together.<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n[[File:xArizonaleg.jpg|thumb|xpx|Arizona being fitted for a prosthetic leg]]\nHearing how Callie was struggling with Arizona, Bailey planned to get Arizona back to work. She used a difficult case to lure Arizona out of her apartment and to the hospital. With fake promises to deliver the patient's chart, she managed to get Arizona walking to the door of her apartment. As the chart wasn't there, Arizona was angry and called Bailey, who promised her to check with happened with the chart. She didn't hear back from Bailey, she left an angry message, which was all part of Bailey's plan. When Bailey didn't reply, Arizona left her apartment to go the hospital and get the chart herself. While Bailey confessed to Callie that she may have pushed Arizona too hard, they saw her walking in the hallway. Bailey told Callie to hide, as her presence would mean too much pressure. Arizona walked over to Bailey, and when she saw the chart, she came up with a possible diagnosis. She informed Bailey on the disease, who was actually just playing stupid to make Arizona feel comfortable at work again.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Arizona returns to work.]]\n\nOn Arizona's first day back at work, Callie urged everyone not to make a big deal out of it and unbeknownst to Arizona, she put [[Heather Brooks]] on wheelchair duty, so Arizona would have a wheelchair nearby when she wanted to sit down. Despite everyone's efforts not to make a big deal out of it, like Alex paying a kid not to ask her about the fake leg, there were some comments about her return and prosthetic, like Bailey mentioning her first surgery was a lot of standing for her first day back. Arizona also walked slower with her walking stick than other doctors, like Alex, who could still run. When they got paged to the ER, Arizona told Alex to run and that she'd follow. While walking to the ER, Arizona noticed Heather with the wheelchair and asked if she could help her, but Heather talked herself out of it with an excuse. When Arizona finally arrived in the ER, April and Alex had already taken the kid to [[Computed Tomography|CT]]. After surgery, Arizona was so proud of herself for getting through the day and completing the surgery that she put all her weight on her left foot, which caused her to fall down. Alex was really worried and sent everyone out to give her some time, but she just laughed about it. After work, Callie came home where she saw Arizona having a little dance party with Sofia, and Arizona told her about her good day.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n\nDespite being asked to be a bridesmaid, Arizona didn't want to go to Bailey's wedding because she wouldn't be able to wear high heels, and flats make her feel less feminine and confident. Callie tried to cheer her up, but it didn't really work. Callie then acknowledged the wedding would just be another reminder of the leg, but told her she was still more beautiful than the other women at the wedding. The next day, moments before leaving for the wedding, Arizona confessed she still wanted to stay home. Callie was angry and told her that the wedding would be all about Bailey and not about the leg, which it had been all about for the past five months. Arizona then put her flat shoe on her prosthetic foot and they left for the wedding, where they waited for Bailey. When Callie confessed she told Bailey she could flee from the wedding, Arizona thought it was a reference to their marriage and was a little offended.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nWhile waiting for Bailey to come to the wedding after the surgery, Callie assured Arizona that her comment to Bailey was just a joke, but this made Arizona think about their marriage. She booked them a room in the hotel where the wedding was organized, and they went there with some mac and cheese cupcakes from the buffet (for in case they worked up an appetite). After preparing the room to get intimate, they confessed they were both nervous. They kissed, but Arizona then said she wanted to take her leg off first while Callie waited in the bathroom, as she wanted the evening to be all about sexy and taking off her prosthetic leg wouldn't be so sexy. Callie thought she was joking at first, but she did what Arizona asked her to when she noticed how serious she was. However, Arizona didn't take off her leg and apologized when Callie came back into the room. She apologized, but she wasn't ready to get sexy again. They ordered champagne to eat with the cupcakes while watching an old movie together. While watching the movie, Arizona suddenly asked Callie not to run, saying she knew she was horrible and that she was finally starting to feel like herself again. She also said that she didn't want everything to be about the leg all the time, and that she couldn't lose Callie. \"So please, don't run,\" Arizona asked her wife. Callie promised her that there was no way she was going to leave Arizona's side, and Arizona then proposed a good old fashioned junior high makeout. After their makeout, they sneaked back to the wedding, where Bailey and Ben were performing their opening dance.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Arizona had a dream about leg falling apart in hundreds of pieces. She suffered from phantom limb at night, but when it started to happen during the day too, she didn't want to talk to Callie about it. During a surgery, Arizona's leg kept on hurting, forcing her to leave the OR. She went to a lounge, where she took of her prosthetic. [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] and [[Alana Cahill]], the physician advisor, came in, and Arizona assured them she was fine. Owen asked Alana to leave them alone, and Arizona though Alana would have her fired, as she hadn't been very efficient lately. Arizona thought she was going crazy, as she felt pain in a part of her that no longer existed, but Owen assured her phantom limb was a very real thing. He took a mirror out of a closet and placed it in between her legs, so she could visualize a leg that didn't hurt. In the army, he had seen phantom limb before and know some ways to ease the pain, the mirror being one of them. It helped a little, and Owen asked her what Callie said about it. Arizona confessed that she hadn't told Callie, as she wanted to be Callie's wife again after having been her patient for so long. She also didn't want her life to get screwed over by something that wasn't even there. Owen then promised he would help her to figure it out. She later met with Alana, who understood that she was having a moment.\n\n\nOn the day of the judgment about the plane crash, Arizona interrupted Derek's ping-pong game to inform him that the lawyer called to tell that they had to meet at the courthouse. The hospital was found negligent, and each of the survivors was granted  million dollars. The doctors, Arizona in particular, weren't extremely happy about the award and went back to work. Throughout the day, Callie planned a \"survivor's dinner\" to celebrate that they won the case. They called a sitter for Sofia and went to the dinner, where Callie celebrated that Arizona stood up for  hours and that they were all still alive. They also toasted to celebrate Meredith's pregnancy. Back at the hospital, Owen found out the insurance company wasn't going to pay, because with Arizona having taken Alex's place on the plane, there were more attendings on the plane than are normally allowed. This would mean the hospital had to pay the awards for the doctors itself, but since there wasn't enough money to do so, the hospital would go bankrupt.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile attending Meredith's [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|baby shower]], Arizona noted how glowy the pregnant Meredith looked. She then turned to Callie and suggested they have a second baby, as it would be nice to have something new and happy to think about. She suggested that she carry the baby this time and a surprised and enthusiastic Callie agreed.\n\nThey soon started to look through several sperm donors and eventually decided on an Ivy League poet, smart and creative. They were drinking wine while Arizona asked Callie if she was going to like being pregnant, and Callie said it's the best, aside from numerous disadvantages, like no drinking. Arizona then jokingly said goodbye to her glass of wine.\n\nSoon after, Arizona was inseminated. When her period was one day late and her breasts started to hurt, Arizona took a pregnancy test and found out that she was in fact pregnant. She told Callie that they were having a baby when Callie came home that night after a long day of work. They hugged in happiness, and Callie even kissed Arizona's belly.\n\nThe now happy again couple went to look at a house with a pool and a swing set, where Arizona started dreaming of the life she and her family could have there. When Arizona took a step towards Callie, who wasn't paying attention to the house as she was busy working on her phone, she stumbled but managed to right herself, showing that her prosthetic leg is no longer a problem to her. \n\nOn the day of the first ultrasound, Callie was unable to come to the appointment because her surgery on [[Travis Reed]] ran long. Arizona came to the scrub room to inform her that she had missed the appointment, and Callie apologized. She asked Arizona to see the picture of the ultrasound, but Arizona told her that there was no picture. The OB did the ultrasound, but couldn't find a heartbeat. She lost the baby.\n\nLater on, Arizona tried to tell Callie how she felt about the miscarriage. Callie thought she was trying to pick a fight and said that they both lost the baby. She proposed they could wait a while before trying again, but Arizona replied that she didn't want to try again as she couldn't handle any more loss. Callie pushed Arizona to answer when she asked her if that meant she didn't ever want to try again, but all Arizona could say was that she didn't know. A disappointed Callie then left Arizona alone to go check on her patient.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\n\nSoon after her miscarriage, Arizona met a woman named Lauren Boswell at the coffee cart when she accidentally took Lauren's coffee. Arizona apologized, but Lauren made no big deal out of it and just took Arizona's coffee instead. Before walking away, she told Arizona she hoped she'd see her around, charming Arizona. Arizona tried to tell Callie who Lauren was (as her name was on the cup of coffee), but Callie was too occupied with trying to get through to Bailey, who had locked herself in her lab. Lauren and Arizona did meet again later when Lauren turned out to be the [[Craniofacial Surgery|craniofacial surgeon]] flown in to consult on a case of Arizona and Jackson. Lauren said she looked forward to talking strategy later on that day, charming Arizona again. While talking about the approach, Callie came in and Arizona introduced her to Lauren. Lauren continued explaining her approach, and said she'd make sure to show off a little in surgery for Arizona. Impressed by Lauren's skills, Callie whispered to Arizona that she was a little bit in love with Lauren, and Arizona awkwardly smiled. At the end of the day, Arizona met Lauren again in the elevator, which was what Lauren had hoped for. She complimented Arizona's eyes, and Arizona then said she was married to Callie and that she only had one leg. As she walked out of the elevator, Lauren said she already knew this as there is only Arizona Robbins on the Internet. Arizona smiled as the doors closed, charmed by the attention she was getting and her having only one leg being no problem for Lauren.<ref>[[Do You Believe in Magic]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Owen informed his staff that they had to cancel all elective procedures as preparation for the superstorm heading towards Seattle, Callie asked Arizona if she was going to postpone Tyler's surgery. Arizona snapped that a baby with his brain on his face wasn't elective and walked away. While presenting the procedure to Tyler's parents, Arizona told the parents she was not worried a bit, clearly complimenting Lauren's skills. Outside the room, Lauren and Arizona chatted for a while, and Arizona confessed that she googled Lauren too. They discovered they studied under the same surgeon, which made Lauren allow Arizona to do part of the surgery. Lauren then asked to get coffee before the surgery, but Arizona said she had other things to do. Lauren joked Arizona was probably going to cyber-stalk her some more, and Arizona replied she might. \n\nWhile scrubbing in early for the surgery, they discovered they were both control freaks. They started flirting somewhat, until Jackson entered the scrub room too. During the surgery, Lauren complimented both Arizona and Jackson for having bought the hospital and saved the staff. She looked right into Arizona's eyes and told her she was impressed. She asked Arizona to move closer to her to start her part of the surgery, while she offered to let Jackson do another part. At the end of the surgery, Lauren left to go the bathroom and Jackson then said that Lauren was just one of these people who could make you feel great. He wished she could stay around a little longer, and Arizona quietly agreed. Later that day, during the proposal when Matthew told April he felt a shock when he first saw her, Arizona and Lauren looked at each other. \n\nMoments later, the storm hit Seattle and Arizona and Lauren went to talk to Tyler's parents. Outside the room, Lauren asked Arizona to show her to an [[On-Call Room|on-call room]] as she likes to stay close by in case anything happens the first night post-op. Arizona did so, and they were both sorry Tyler's case was over. Lauren then said she would want her back at some point, and Arizona replied that would be great. Arizona stuck out her hand to say goodbye, but Lauren laughed at this. They moved closer and hugged, and as the lights fell out due to the storm, they kissed each other in the dark. When the lights came back on, Arizona pushed Lauren off and walked towards the door, saying she couldn't do this. Right before opening the door, Lauren told Arizona she was allowed to lose a little bit of control. Arizona then locked the door, kissed Lauren again, and took off Lauren's lab coat.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n[[File:xArizonalauren.jpg|thumb|xpx|Lauren and Arizona kiss.]]\nAs Callie started questioning where Arizona was, Arizona got dressed again in the on-call room to get to the understaffed [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]]. Lauren, who was still lying in the bed, asked if she needed an extra set of hands to help out, but Arizona rejected the offer. The situation in the NICU got even more complicated when the electricity died, meaning the ventilator batteries would die eventually. However, Lauren did not listen and came to the NICU anyway, stating she was not going to sit around while there was a room full of babies needing help. Alex happily accepted her help as Arizona had just told them they needed to do anything to keep the parents happy. While looking for spare batteries for the NICU machines, Arizona confessed to Alex that she cheated on Callie with \"that woman out there\" and that she felt horrible about it.\n\nAs Arizona was manually ventilating a baby, Lauren came over and told her that she wasn't going to leave things like this as she liked Arizona a lot. Then Callie appeared, just as the electricity came back on. In the light, Callie noticed Arizona's ring was pinned to Lauren's scrub top. Lauren tried to come up with an excuse, but Callie figured out what had happened. She and Arizona went to a lounge, where they started fighting. Callie questioned how Arizona could cheat on her after everything they've survived, like the plane crash. Arizona then yelled back that Callie hadn't been on the plane and out there in the woods for days, even though she kept on acting like she had been. Arizona then asked if Callie wanted the badge of honor and the warrior wounds for having survived the plane crash. \"Then great, stick out your leg and I will go grab a bone saw and let's even the score!\" Arizona yelled at Callie, who was heartbroken that Arizona still hadn't forgiven her about the leg. Arizona explained that Callie was the one person she trusted most in her life, and she was the one who decided to cut off the leg. Callie yelled back that she did so to save Arizona's life. Arizona yelled back that Callie didn't lose anything, while she did, alluding to her amputation and her miscarriage. A crying Callie replied that she apparently did lose Arizona.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Callie made the comment about having lost her, Arizona was left speechless as an angry Callie left the room. When Jackson came into the board meeting to tell them that Dr. Boswell was in a cab on her way to the airport, Callie outed Arizona as a cheater in front of everyone, embarrassing Arizona. Arizona and Callie were forced to work together on a victim of the mudslide caused by the storm, much to Callie's dislike. She specifically requested Bailey for the surgery on the patient, but since Bailey was busy with Richard, Arizona stepped up as a general surgeon. In the scrub room, Arizona asked Callie to set aside their problems for the patient. During the surgery, Leah complimented Arizona's technique, and Callie then apologized for having stated that Arizona wasn't a general surgeon. Arizona replied that it was okay, as they've all said things they shouldn't have. Later that day, Arizona met Alex in a supply room and they talked about her cheating. She thought it would make them stronger as a couple. She told him the ortho metaphor she worked out to tell Callie, but Alex wasn't enthusiastic about it and advised her to stick to apologizing for being such a slut. While they watched how Richard was brought to the OR, Arizona unsuccessfully tried to make eye contact with Callie.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nLater that evening, Arizona found Callie and asked her to have a conversation. She started saying that she deserved Callie telling everyone what she did, but Callie broke her off, saying now wasn't the time to talk. When Arizona came home after work, she found out that Callie took her clothes, Sofia, and some of Sofia's clothes. Not knowing that Callie was staying at Meredith's with Sofia, Arizona went back to the hospital and tried to get someone to page Callie , as Callie didn't reply to Arizona's pages. She got Alex to do so, but Callie was too drunk already to reply. Arizona was paged to Meredith's room, where Meredith told her that Callie and Sofia were at her house. Arizona went there, and she and Callie argued over their marriage and the decision to start a family while Derek watched Zola and Sofia. The next day at the hospital, Callie told Arizona, who started apologizing for the previous night, that they were going to take a break and live apart for a while, with switching off Sofia every two nights. They would do it like that for unknown time. However, that night, Arizona came to Meredith's house asking for a couple of minutes with Sofia. Cristina interfered and made Callie allow it. Arizona took her daughter to the deck, where she told Sofia that she loved and missed her.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nArizona decided to look nice to get Callie back. She got a haircut and chose Callie's favorite red dress. It was an incredibly busy day at work, as the hospital, which was in financial difficulties after the damage done by the storm, needed both doctors and board members. Also, several board members were out and Callie and Arizona couldn't be in the same room together, complicating things even more. Arizona reminded Callie that they had an appointment for couples' therapy, but Callie wasn't sure she was going to be there yet. In the evening, Owen did finally manage to gather all the board members to plan a fundraising gala to help out the hospital financially. At the end of the day, Callie did show up at the therapist's office, but only to tell Arizona that she was not going to therapy with her yet. She advised Arizona to follow therapy on her own for a while. Arizona begged her to talk about what happened as she really needed to talk, but Callie, who noticed Arizona wore the red dress, didn't want to talk about the cheating as it hurt her and walked off, leaving behind a devastated Arizona.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nArizona went to the fundraising gala, but soon left after having shared some awkward looks with Callie, who started to tell people that her wife died in the plane crash just to get more donations out of the rich people at the party. Arizona went to the hospital and started crying in a supply closet, only to be found by April, who was sent back to the hospital by Jackson to get cooling blankets for the champagne bottles. Arizona made up an excuse and told April she was fine, but started crying again as soon as April left the room. At the gala, April overheard Callie's fake story of being a widow and she decided to support Arizona. She took two bottles of champagne and returned to the hospital to drink with Arizona. Arizona then confessed she couldn't stand the way everyone stared at her, and the way everyone talked and judged her, including April. \"I know you're trying to hide it, but I can see it on your face,\" Arizona said. Arizona didn't deny she was a cheater, and explained that she cheated because Lauren stared at her too, but in a different way. She stared in a way that made Arizona feel really good. They got drunk, and paged Leah to the closet to get them some more champagne and snacks. Arizona asked April if she thought Callie was ever going to forgive her, and April honestly told her that Callie was telling everyone at the gala that Arizona was dead, so she guessed not. They got drunker and got more fun, both agreeing that they need to have fun again. At some point, April asked her if she could try on her leg and they both laughed. They called a cab to get them home, and Leah helped Arizona to get in. Leah asked Arizona to treat her with more respect. \"You're adorable,\" Arizona said, as she touched Leah's nose. Arizona then closed the door and the cab drove off.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nSome time after the gala, Leah brought Arizona a cup of coffee before the big surgery with Shepherd. Arizona asked April what she did to make Leah so nice to her, and then vaguely remembered that she may have brought Leah home with her the night of the gala. She was drunk then and now only had a vague memory of Leah in her kitchen, making her question if she slept with her. Arizona handed over the mortgage slips to Callie, who snapped at her. Arizona said that if Callie wanted her to move out, she only had to ask, but Callie replied she didn't want to live in the apartment she shared with her cheating wife. During the surgery, Leah came in, ready to scrub in. She told Arizona that Arizona promised to allow her to scrub in on the surgery on the night of the gala. Leah promised her she wouldn't tell anybody what happened, but Arizona cut her off and said she could be more useful handling patients on the floor, making Leah leave. That night, Arizona had a drink at Joe's bar, when Callie came in and told her that she was kicking Arizona out of the apartment right now, not even allowing her to pack up her stuff. Leah overheard this and offered her to stay at her place, and Arizona then asked her to tell what they did after the gala as she didn't remember and she was worried about what happened as Leah was a pretty girl. Leah told her she went to check if Arizona made it home, only to find her passed out on the hallway floor. They went inside, had a dance party, and ate grilled cheese sandwiches while watching videos of Shepherd performing a spinal AVM surgery, which is when Arizona promised her she could scrub in. Arizona confessed she only vaguely remembered the grilled cheese, and Leah then asked her to go back to the part where she said she was pretty, making Arizona smile in embarrassment.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nArizona and Leah started off a somewhat secret relationship and hung out together, but Leah thought it was more than Arizona did and she kept on texting Arizona. At the hospital, Leah told her she was ready to take it further. Arizona didn't think it was a good idea, though she still agreed to hang out that night. Leah planned to scrub in on a surgery with Arizona, which was observed by [[Emma Marling|Emma]], but Arizona said the OR was full and sent Leah away. In surgery, Arizona asked Alex about his strategy to get away from someone who gets way too attached after a one-night stand, which wasn't even a real one-night stand. \"You know who's like that? Leah Murphy,\" Alex said, adding that Leah goes from zero to \"I love you\" in  seconds. Leah eventually told her fellow residents that she was having something with Arizona. Arizona waved her over and Leah apologized to Arizona for having told them, but Arizona then said she was going to be very frank. She said the other night was a bad call because she was lonely, that it was just once and that it would stay that way, and she asked Leah to adjust her expectations if she was expecting more. An emotional Leah said it was her fault and apologized for having misunderstood as she tried to hold back her tears. This touched Arizona and she tried to talk, but Leah ran off into the restroom. That night, Arizona felt lonely again in her hotel room and decided to text Leah again.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nArizona started off a sexual relationship with Leah and they agreed it would just be sex. However, the night before Halloween, Leah did sleep over, which they had previously agreed she wouldn't do. Arizona didn't seem to mind and let go of their agreement when she offered to have breakfast together, but Leah left as she wanted to show Arizona she was serious about being easy peasy. At the hospital, Arizona and Callie found out they both made different costumes for Sofia. Arizona proposed to have Sofia choose between her astronaut costume and Callie's princess costume, but Callie thought it wasn't worth the fight and told Arizona she could take Sofia to the party at Meredith's. Before going to the party, Arizona opened up to Leah, who was scared she got HIV after a patient bit her,  about her first disease scare during her residency and she told Leah she didn't have to try to be easy peasy all the time. In the evening, Callie and Arizona eventually both went to Meredith's party and set aside their problems that night for Sofia. They combined their costumes, so Sofia dressed up as a space princess, which was the first thing they agreed on in months. Together with Meredith and Derek, they took Sofia out for trick-or-treating.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Emma Marling was offered a position as maternal-fetal surgeon, Arizona informed her that Callie, her ex-wife, was going to interview her. Emma asked for more information about Callie, and Arizona told her that Callie is great, but not that great as they're divorced now. During a conversation with April, Arizona revealed that she and Leah took the flirtation further and had amazing sex. After the interview, Emma asked Arizona how long she and Callie have been divorced, and while playing with her necklace, Arizona admitted that she didn't think they were, saying they were more more just separated than divorced. Emma noted that Arizona was still wearing the ring while seeing other people, which Arizona confirmed. Emma apologized for being too personal, but Arizona didn't mind as they do too personal on a daily basis at Grey Sloan Memorial. That night, before joining Leah in the shower in her hotel room, Arizona carefully took off her necklace and carefully put it away in a box.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Callie was informed that both she and the hospital were being sued by [[Travis Reed]], a board meeting was called. They discussed whether or not the hospital should settle, as they were risking bankruptcy all over again if the case was going to trial. The hospital decided to settle, while Callie decided to fight the allegations. When Arizona came to pick up Sofia before Callie had to go to the court for her lawsuit, she told Callie that she was willing to do whatever Callie needed to feel good in the difficult period of being sued. While Callie was putting on her pantyhose, Arizona noted that Callie had her wedding ring back on. Callie replied that she put it on because her lawyer told her to, and Arizona then wished her good luck before leaving with Sofia. During a break in court, Arizona met Callie in the bathroom of the courthouse, where Callie was changing her pantyhose. Callie was feeling awful, and Arizona gave her a drawing Sofia made to make her feel better. Callie took the drawing and thanked Arizona for being there. They then shared a laugh when they discovered Callie had accidentally put on pantyhose with butterflies on them.\n\nDays after, Arizona came to pick up Sofia at Callie's. She was stared at intensely by Callie's dad, as he found out she cheated on his daughter. Feeling uncomfortable, Arizona quickly left with Sofia. However, it was Carlos who later revealed during a conversation with Callie that he once cheated, but he and Callie's mother decided to give their marriage another chance, with Callie's mother having forgiven him for the one mistake he made. Callie then went to Arizona's hotel room, and told her that she got that Arizona made one mistake. She forgave her for that and asked her to come home. She gave Arizona time to think about it and left. Arizona then went back into her hotel room, where she asked a naked Leah to get dressed and leave right now.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after, Arizona moved back into Callie's apartment, though Callie made her sleep on the couch. At work. she and Leah worked together on a girl with a broken femur, which required Callie consulting. Arizona made it clear to Leah that she and Callie were trying to repair their marriage and assured her that it didn't have to be awkward between the three of them. However, Arizona confessed to Callie that she slept with someone more than ten times while they were broken up but assured her that it was over. Arizona begged her wife to keep trying to fix their marriage, and after agreeing, they hugged each other for the first time in months. Arizona didn't mention who she slept with, though Callie figured it out later in surgery when Leah made a mistake and desperately begged Arizona to step in and help her. Arizona did help her, but when Leah was ranting at her after the surgery for having told Callie that they slept together, Arizona made it clear that her marriage was more important than making sure Callie wouldn't hate Leah. At the end of the day, Arizona told an angry Callie that she couldn't keep apologizing and that Callie couldn't keep playing a victim. Arizona said that she was back, but not to be Callie's whipping boy and then demanded to sleep in the bed again. Callie asked for one more night to process Arizona having slept with Leah, and Arizona pointed out she wasn't exactly enthusiastic about Arizona being back.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nArizona and Callie continued to work on their marriage. They managed to stay professional with Leah, who tried her best to forget about Arizona. However, there was still some tension between Arizona and Callie. When Callie was sad because her research was failing, Arizona tried to get her to cheer up, but after some snapping, Callie just walked out on Arizona. While talking with [[Kimmie Kepner|Kimmie]] about their marriages where one of the partners cheated, Kimmie revealed that she and her husband just hope things will get better as they don't feel the need to talk it to death. At the end of the evening, Callie and Arizona started fighting again at their apartment. They then realize that them trying to talk with each other so much may be the problem, and they kiss each other passionately.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of April's wedding, Callie and Derek started the second phase of their research. When Callie joined Arizona in surgery, she told her wife that it was a good thing for her, as the goal of the research was to get Arizona a leg that's as sensitive and responsive as the leg she lost. During the surgery, Callie asked Arizona if she would wear her high heel leg to the wedding, but advised her not to as the wedding was at a muddy farm and Arizona's leg always gets sore after a while. Arizona said she'll be fine, and then Callie heard that the boy they were operating on was most likely accidentally paralyzed by his father, who didn't wait for an ambulance after the accident. Callie started criticizing the father, but Arizona came to his defense. \"Sometimes we try to make things better and we have actually no idea that we're actually causing more pain,\" Arizona said, clearly also talking about Callie trying to fix her.\n\nAt the wedding, Callie once again brought up that she was doing the research for Arizona. Arizona started crying a bit, and she quickly went to the farm with Callie. Arizona went to help April to get dressed up, and broke down in the dressing room. She revealed it was driving her crazy how Callie kept on trying to forgive and take care of her. She clarified she really wants to fix the relationship that she had broken, while Callie wants to fix her. Arizona added that that's what made Lauren so attractive, as she was still attracted to Arizona, even though she never knew her before the accident. Callie makes her feel like she's not enough, and she knows it's unfair to Callie, which is why she hates feeling like this. \"Callie is trying to fix everything and I'm finally feeling okay the way that I am now, and I'm not sure Callie will ever make me feel that way,\" Arizona concluded as April hugged her to comfort her. Arizona walked April down the aisle and shared a look with Callie, which made her cry once again.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nCallie and Arizona decided to use a surrogate to try to have another child. However, they got into a fight in the waiting room at the surrogacy agency and put the idea on hold. They decided to go see a [[Kim Dawson|marriage counselor]] who told them to take a  day break. During their first attempt, they kissed on day  and had to re-start. On the second go, day , Callie and Arizona slept together, but agreed not to tell their marriage counselor. As Arizona kept busy with her new fellowship, Callie confided in Meredith and they went to Joe's bar together. On day , they went back to the counselor together, where Arizona said that she needed Callie, her anchor. However, Callie responded that she had spent the last  days feeling free, doing more and feeling better. She decided she didn't want to be with someone who made her feel stuck and she believed that working on their marriage was slowly killing her. <ref>[[Bend & Break]], x</ref>\n\n\nArizona began a new fellowship at GSMH with [[Nicole Herman|Dr. Nicole Herman]], an outstanding fetal surgeon who began to teach Arizona all her skills and knowledge.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref> Arizona quickly learned that Dr. Herman had a brain tumor and had been given six months to live.<ref>[[Don't Let's Start]], x</ref> Dr. Herman stated that in that time, she would teach Arizona everything she knows for none of her knowledge is written down in books and she wanted her knowledge to be known so it could save more lives. Arizona agreed to continue to work with her without telling anyone else.<ref>[[Could We Start Again, Please?]], x</ref> However, she began to suspect that Dr. Herman's behavior change was due to the tumor and had her scans sent over for her to look at. She consulted with [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], who later told Arizona that she believed she could remove the tumor.<ref>[[Risk]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Alex moved out and sold the house back to Meredith, Arizona had to move out. She found a house and pinned a flyer to a board at the hospital to find a roommate. Much to her discomfort, nobody was interested, so she took a tab of her own flyer to make other people interested. Throughout the day, Arizona noticed that Stephanie acted as if there were a reason that people didn't want to live with her. When confronted about this, Stephanie confessed that Arizona intimidated residents and interns because of everything she had been through and done in both her professional and personal life. At the end of the day, intern Andrew DeLuca showed interest as nobody else wanted to live with him. Arizona decided they'd work it out and accepted him as her roommate.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nOn Bailey's first day as Chief, Arizona was confronted with Callie enthusiastically telling everyone but her about her fantastic new girlfriend. That sparked a little bit of jealousy in Arizona, but she told Callie she could still always talk to her. When Callie started talking about how great her girlfriend was and how they connected, Arizona asked her to dial down the enthusiasm a little and advised her to read the room before opening her mouth.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\nArizona had a moment of looking back on her life when she worked together with Alex on two equally sick twins and they had to decide which one would get the donor liver. The situation reminded Arizona about their first case together and she shared that she was very proud of him and that she trusted him to handle this case well.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter having heard about Penny through Callie's stories, it was finally time for Arizona to meet her at the dinner party at Meredith's house. Arizona really wanted to meet her, but she was nervous and it also reminded her that she had nobody. That day, she bonded with an old patient who found new love in a retirement home, and that man made her believe that she'd find love again. Up until that day, she thought she'd screwed up the one great love of her life. That evening, Arizona was nervous about meeting Penny at the dinner party and started drinking excessively to ease her nerves.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref> The drinking helped to ease her nerves and she and Penny were introduced by Callie. They bonded over a shared experience of moving all the time as a kid. Arizona really took a liking to Penny and described her as perfect, which led her to wonder why she didn't have a Penny herself. She joked about taking Penny home, until the dinner party was blown when Meredith revealed that Penny was the doctor who had failed to save Derek. Arizona then took to eating dessert right out of the dish before April took her home.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Arizona decided it was time to get back in the dating pool and picked trivia night at a lesbian bar as the perfect opportunity to dip her toe in. Both April and Alex turned her down to accompany her, but Richard was very interested in a trivia night. She didn't dare to tell him the truth until they were at the bar. She confided she was nervous to start dating again and didn't know where to start. Richard proved a very capable wingman and got her connected to several women to her liking.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref>\n\nArizona was interested in a female firefighter named Charlotte, who ended up at the hospital with a gluteal burn. Arizona inadvertently complimented her butt and they bonded over the fact that both their jobs meant that other people had to go through something bad. She approached Richard so he could find out if Charlotte was also interested in her, but he refused to wingman a patient. Arizona tried to ask her out, but Charlotte mistook it as an invite for a follow-up. She went to ask Richard for advice, and was told that she was a smart and confident woman. All she had to do was stretch her wings and feel the air. As she gathered up the courage to ask Charlotte out, she was surprised when Charlotte introduced her to her girlfriend. She quickly discharged Charlotte and went to tell Richard that she crashed instead of flew.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the failed attempt, she and Richard continued their nights out to the lesbian bar.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref> Arizona was the first one to find out about April's pregnancy after her divorce to Jackson.<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref> As she tried to steer April towards telling Jackson, Richard inquired Arizona about the woman she had left the bar with. She initially dismissed it as just fine, but he insisted to hear more so he could improve his wingman project. She then said they went \"everywhere.\" Despite the fact that it was fun, she decided not to see the woman again because she was also kind of crazy. As they were operating, Richard asked how many women she was seeing. Arizona replied not so many and asked Andrew to back her up, but then realized he was with his girlfriend every night. She recalled he brought her to their house once and shared she was a real screamer, unaware that she was talking about Maggie. Afterwards, as she was preparing to leave for another date, he told her he worried that a quality person like her was squandering her heart with all those different woman. She said her wingman couldn't also be her dad. He helped her to remember what it was like to be fun and confident and a little slutty, something she wanted to embrace while she was still young and fun. He helped her fly.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref>\n\nApril continued to refuse to tell Jackson about her pregnancy while Arizona continued to advise her to tell him, since other people had already find out. At the end of the day, Arizona witnessed Maggie finally coming clean about her relationship with Andrew.<ref>[[All Eyez on Me]], x</ref> Arizona continued to push April to tell Jackson since she worried April was doing this alone. April then declared Arizona her companion, after which Arizona stated they would do this right with monitoring and tests. However, April refused to have her baby tested, convinced he or she would turn out okay. Arizona tried to get support from Alex, but he initially didn't want to get mixed up in the matter. However, after working with Arizona on a woman with quadruplets, he had a talk with April. While April initially still refused to tell Jackson, she finally realized she needed to do it before he found out from someone else. As she went to see him in his lab, she was shocked to find out that Arizona had just delivered the news behind her back.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref> April was furious at her. Arizona explained she didn't want April to go through what happened last time again, but April says her faith in a good outcome would remain until God told her otherwise. She then asked Arizona to stay away from her and told her to go to Hell. Arizona continued to think she did the right thing, but both Callie and Bailey told her she did wrong. Later, Amelia told her that all she could do to make it right was to wait and hope that April would eventually forgive her.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref> As April continued to be mad, Arizona found herself in the middle of other people's situation again when Callie lied to Penny and told her that Arizona was not comfortable with her meeting Sofia. Upon finding out, Arizona set the record straight and went to tell Callie she was done with getting in the middle of other people's things.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\nThe feud with April was solved when they worked together on [[Jennifer Parker|Jenny Parker]], a pregnant teen who refused to tell her mother about the pregnancy. Having learned her lesson, Arizona respected Jenny's wishes while April eventually told the mother. While April did not consider her situation and Jenny's to be the same, Arizona pointed out she felt about April's situation as April felt about Jenny's. Later that night, April confessed that she had overheard Catherine saying Jackson wanted to sue for full custody over their child and that, refusing to be a victim, she filed for a restraining order against Jackson.<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref> Arizona accompanied April to [[Lucinda Gamble]], a lawyer, to get advice on her situation with Jackson and later gave her an ultrasound to assure her everything was fine with her baby.\n\n\nAt work, Arizona walked in on Callie and Penny getting intimate in a supply closet. Callie later came to apologize, she brought up that Penny was moving to New York after winning the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]]. As she wasn't sure their relationship would survive that, Arizona pointed out there were plenty of ways to make it work if she wanted it to work. That advice backfired heavily as it inspired Callie to decide to move to New York with Penny, and take Sofia with her. She assured Arizona she could see Sofia whenever she wanted and then got paged away, leaving a shocked Arizona. After witnessing Sofia leave with a happy Callie and Penny, Arizona took to Lucinda Gamble herself to start a custody battle over Sofia as she refused to let Callie move across the country with her daughter.<ref>[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]], x</ref>\n\nArizona met up with Callie, who was excited about moving to New York and shared school brochures of New York schools, for which they would need to apply if Sofia were to move to New York. Arizona asked her to take a step back and pointed out she never said yes to the plan. Callie wanted to discuss options, but Arizona said it sounded like she had already decided. She argued Sofia's life was in Seattle. Callie argued that Arizona moved a lot in her youth and she turned out fine. Arizona walked away and discussed the problem with Richard, who understood her urge to protect herself but also exemplified April and Jackson's turbulent situation, caused by overreactions and misunderstandings. He urged her to think about Sofia, who was too important to do something that could not be undone. However, Arizona solidified her stance when she was contacted by a New York school about Sofia's application. Later, Callie came to apologize for jumping the gun, but Arizona told her about the Barton School calling her. Callie explained there were waiting lists. Arizona then gave Callie her lawyer's card and stated they would only talk through her. Callie asked who was jumping the gun now, but Arizona bounced back that she was the one who started this.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], x</ref>\n\nPrior to the hearing, Richard advised Arizona to get some friends to testify for her, however she didn't want to do it and thought the subpoena should do that. Richard encouraged her and she figured out that she would have April and Jackson's support. However, before she managed to ask them for the favor while doing ultrasound for April, Penny came into the room and told Arizona that she was on Arizona's service that day. Later in the cafeteria, Arizona tried to ask Alex to testify for her, which he promptly rejected, as he considered both Callie and her as friends. Penny then appeared. Arizona yelled at her, believing she was spying for Callie, before leaving. Arizona was then found crying in her car by Richard. She told him that she was fighting a losing battle. Richard said if she wanted her daughter, she had to fight like she'd never fought before.<ref>[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]], x</ref>\n\nBefore the custody hearing started, Arizona and Callie's respective lawyers tried to negotiate to prevent going to court, but failed to come to a compromise. In court, after hearing both sides, Arizona was eventually granted sole physical custody of Sofia.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref> Arizona, seeing how sad Callie was, agreed to let Callie have her for alternating school years and Christmases.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nArizona traveled to New York to help Sofia get settled with Callie and Penny. When she returned to Seattle, she was confronted with Andrew's bruised up face. She confronted Alex, who had ignored her concerned calls and texts, and scolded him for his actions. She later assured Andrew she didn't want him to move out of the house and expressed support for him. While still mad at him, Arizona also missed Alex. He told Arizona that the guy she trained and raised was still there since he was determined to work at the clinic to get his job back rather than quitting.<ref>[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Eliza first came to Grey Sloan, she flirted with Arizona, telling her she didn't need to write her name down to remember it.<ref>[[Why Try to Change Me Now]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Eliza came to the hospital to help out after a building collapsed, she was surprised that Arizona appeared not to remember their conversation, but Arizona admitted that she did and she was interested, but she didn't like that Eliza talked like she owned the place. They agreed to go get a drink together afterward. <ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, when Eliza officially started, Arizona had joined the resistance against Eliza's policies. Despite this, Eliza found Arizona at the end of the day and told her that her allowing Leah to take the lead on the Wallace baby was a perfect example of her teaching strategy and thanked her for being on board.<ref>[[Jukebox Hero]], x</ref>\n\nAs Arizona was leaving the hospital the next day, Eliza found her and when she claimed she'd be happy if Eliza was fired, Eliza called her on it, saying it would scare her because it would mean the two of them could be something.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\nAfter losing her first child patient, Eliza was distraught and Arizona coached her on how to get through that loss. At the end of the day, when Arizona was leaving work, she saw Eliza crying in her car and hitting the steering wheel. This caused the horn to honk continuously. Arizona told her to pop the hood and she quickly pulled the horn wire, which she told Eliza she'd need to have fixed. Eliza thanked her and then they hugged. Arizona told Eliza that she could have friends at the hospital if she wanted.<ref>[[It Only Gets Much Worse]], x</ref>\n\nAround the hospital, the two continued to pretend not to get along. However, at the end of the night, Arizona said she didn't want to pretend, because Eliza's nice and funny and people should know that. Eliza told her to be quiet and kissed her.<ref>[[Back Where You Belong]], x</ref>\n\nEliza asked Arizona about how big her stove was, because she wanted to make Arizona pierogi. She then flirtatiously said, in Polish, that once Arizona had her pierogi, she'd never want anyone else's. However, that evening, when Eliza went to find Arizona, she was asleep on the couch. They agreed to rest for a minute and then rally, but they both fell asleep and when they woke up, it was morning. They leaned in for a kiss, but Richard Webber interrupted, discovering their relationship.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n\nAfter they'd been seeing each other for a while, Eliza told Arizona she was ready for them to have sex. They made plans for that night, but they were cancelled when one of Arizona's patients went into labor, but Arizona told Eliza that she looked for her around the hospital all the time and that the anticipation of waiting one more day wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. The next night, they left the hospital and went to Arizona's house, where they had sex.<ref>[[Leave It Inside]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the hospital fire chaos had settled, Arizona found Eliza and suggested they go back to her place to have overly tired sex before getting some sleep. Eliza told her she couldn't. She needed to pack up her things because she'd been fired.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\nEliza \"ghosted\" Arizona, not replying to her messages and moving out of her apartment without saying a word to Arizona about it.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Sofia moved back to Seattle, she told Arizona that she wanted her room to be green, but Arizona couldn't decide which shade, so she told Sofia she could decide herself and they'd paint it together. She also surprised Sofia with three different flavors of ice cream.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nAfter her return to Seattle, Sofia refused to go to school. She said she wanted to go back to New York with her friends and the teacher who let them draw on their notebooks. Instead of making her go to school, Arizona took Sofia to work with her, where Sofia met [[Noah Brosniak]], the son of a patient, and the two played together while Arizona examined Noah's mom. Noah was diagnosed with a brain tumor and when Arizona tucked Sofia in that night, she cried because she realized she was so lucky to have a healthy, smart girl and she was sometimes too busy to understand that. She suggested that she take the next day off and take Sofia to find an adventure.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nAfter that incident, Sofia continued to refuse to go to school. Arizona had to bribe her in order to get her to go to school.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nSofia was suspended from school for stealing the field trip money from her class. Arizona took her to work and put her in the daycare for the day. Then she learned from reading Sofia's diary that she stole the money to buy a plane ticket to New York and didn't want to tell Arizona because she worried about hurting her feelings. That led her to make the decision that Sofia needed to move back to New York and she needed to go with her.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\n\nAt the time of her first appearance, Arizona was a cheerful and bubbly person, waking up happy every day. She genuinely cares for her patients and their relatives. Her bright personality became darker after the plane crash, but over time, she found herself and her happiness again, albeit more serious than she used to be.\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nArizona is a lesbian and was married to [[Callie Torres]].[[File:Callie&Arizona.jpg|thumb|Callie and Arizona]]\n\nAt the [[Emerald City Bar]], she saw that Callie was upset and came to comfort her in the bathroom and kissed her. Callie soon decided to ask her out, but Arizona declined the offer after finding out [[Erica Hahn|Erica]] was Callie's first girlfriend. Her reasons were metaphorical: she deals mostly with newborns at work; she does not want to deal with them in her personal life, but she claimed \"[she is] super flattered. Super.\" at the offer. Annoyed, Callie confronted her, but the situation was made more awkward after she discovered that Arizona was on a date with a woman named [[Julie]].\n\nCallie started to avoid her, but she was eventually cornered in the elevator. Arizona then decided to explain that sometimes she doesn't always make the right choice under pressure and that she was wrong. Callie accepted it and Arizona asked her out again and after pretending not to be interested for a few seconds, Callie accepted.\n\nTheir relationship continued, but when Callie's father came to visit and discovered that she was dating a girl, he cut Callie off. Mark and Cristina both suggested that she lie and say she broke up with Arizona, but after Arizona approached her and told her that she loved how Callie cared so much about things and wouldn't care if Callie lied, Callie decided not to lie because her family should accept her.\n\nHowever, Callie began to withdraw slightly and began to avoid Arizona. Arizona then asked if their relationship was just a fling and it had run its course and Callie told her that it probably was. Arizona later approached Callie and Callie told her the real reason was because she didn't have the money for four-star restaurants anymore but Arizona told her that they could stay in and eat sandwiches. Callie countered that neither of them liked sandwiches, so they settled on pizza instead.\n\nThe relationship was threatened again when Callie got annoyed at Arizona for believing that George joining the army was awesome, but after hearing that Arizona's brother died in the war, she apologized.\n\nOn Arizona's birthday, after a failed surprise party, Arizona told Callie she loved her, and Callie reciprocated her feelings. Callie was dismayed to learn that Arizona didn't want children. She assumed that Arizona's reluctance was related to her brother's death, but Arizona told her she simply liked her life the way it was. They came to the conclusion that they could not continue their relationship, as they both wanted different things. However, after a shooter entered Seattle Grace with a vendetta for Derek, Lexie, and Richard, they were in lockdown together, and eventually decided to get back together and have kids. They passionately kissed in happiness.\n\nSix months after the shooting, Arizona received word that she had been given the Carter Maddison Grant, and was allowed to go to Malawi and become a doctor there. She had applied for this grant two years previously, when she hadn't met Callie yet. After some hesitation, Arizona decided to accept the grant. In the end, Callie was shown to have accepted this as well and decided to leave with Arizona. However, a fight at the airport resulted in Arizona leaving for Africa without Callie. After some time passed, Arizona came back and told Callie she missed her, but Callie closed the door in her face.\n\nCallie continued to reject Arizona's constant pleading and apologies. Eventually, Callie revealed that she was pregnant with Mark's baby. After asking for time to process, Arizona accepted the situation, and she and Callie restarted their relationship. Callie and Arizona later reconciled and they moved back in together. After seeing the baby's heartbeat for the first time, Arizona referred to the baby as \"theirs.\"\n\nHowever, tensions continued with Mark in the picture as an active and interested father. Callie gifted Arizona with a weekend getaway, but continued communicating with Mark as she and Arizona drove. Arizona's jealousy came to the forefront, and the two argued, with Callie concluding, \"Tell me what you want and I'll do it.\" After a pause, Arizona said, \"Marry me.\" They had shocked faces as they approached a stopped truck and crashed. Arizona was slightly battered, but Callie (who'd taken off her seatbelt) flew through the windshield. A series of surgeries followed (including the delivery of [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|her very premature baby]]) along with emotional breakdowns by both Mark and Arizona. Callie eventually woke up and turned to Arizona, who was sitting at her bedside, and whispered, \"Yes, I'll marry you.\" They finally married at a ceremony officiated by [[Miranda Bailey]].\n\nThe plane crash put a strain on their relationship. Arizona made Callie promise that she would not cut her leg off and Callie agreed. However, Arizona had an infection in her leg that she could have died from if she didn't cut off the leg. Because Callie broke the promise, Arizona began to ignore her. Finally, as she regained her strength and confidence when she learned to use her prosthetic. Arizona even became pregnant with a sperm donor's child but miscarried. Their relationship took a turn for the better until Arizona slept with Lauren Boswell during the superstorm, and Callie found out. Callie and Arizona were separated until after Callie's trial when Callie asked Arizona to move back in. After Arizona cheats on [[Callie Torres]] with [[Lauren Boswell]] during the superstorm. When Callie finds out she is furious she ends up kicking her out of the house. After being kicked out Callie and Arizona both agree couples therapy would be the best option. In the end, Arizona and Callie end up divorcing.\n\n[[Lauren Boswell]]\nDr. Lauren Boswell came to GSM to perform a surgery on an infant with his brain growing on the outside of his head. She was very flirtatious with Arizona, who happily flirted back. They would joke about how they looked at each other up on the internet and knew all about each other. At the start of the [[Readiness is All|superstorm]], she asked for Arizona to show her to an on-call room to rest in. Arizona obliged and took her there. They said their goodbyes and Arizona extended her arm for a handshake. Lauren simply laughed and they hugged. The lights flickered off from the superstorm as they started kissing. As the lights flickered back on, Arizona pushed her off, saying that she couldn't do that. Arizona almost left and Lauren said, \"Arizona, you are allowed to lose a little bit of control.\" Arizona pondered the thought for a moment and ended up locking the door instead of opening it. She returned to Lauren and kissed her while she pulled off Lauren's lab coat. The two of them had sex and accidentally exchanged scrub tops, which is how Callie noticed later that Arizona had cheated on her.\n\n[[Leah Murphy]]\nOn the night of the fundraising gala, Arizona Robbins and [[April Kepner]] bonded over drinks in the hospital storage closet. Since they were too intoxicated to drive, Leah called them a cab.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref> Shortly thereafter, Leah called to make sure the girls arrived home safely and ended up visiting Arizona at her apartment. The two watched movies and talked all night (though Arizona remembered none of it). Worried about what took place that night, Arizona asked Leah if anything happened between them and Leah told her nothing had.\n\nHowever, the two ended up making out on a different occasion, causing Leah to become somewhat obsessed with Arizona (much like she did with Alex). Arizona rebuffed her obsession and ended things. Leah told Arizona that she respected her so much and the thought of Arizona thinking about her in that way made her feel amazing. That night Arizona texted Leah asking 'What are you up to?' implying that she wanted her to come over. The two of them ended up sharing a kiss.\n\nOn the morning of Halloween, Leah wakes up in Arizona's hotel bed. She gets ready to leave, waking up Arizona, Arizona says that she doesn't have to leave. Leah says she knows she's not supposed to sleep over and apologizes, but Arizona says it's okay. Leah thinks it's not, as she's all about easy. At the hospital, Leah gets bit in the neck by a drug addict and is tested for HIV. Arizona helped calm her worry. She told Leah a similar story to reach out to her.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref> The two of them continued to see each other sexually until Callie asked Arizona to move back in. \n\n[[Eliza Minnick]]\nWhen a new consultant was hired by Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to revamp their surgical residency program, Eliza made a loud entrance. When Eliza was in the elevator on her way to Bailey's office, Arizona walked by and asked if she needed help. Eliza answered that she forgot where chief Bailey had her office. Arizona then mentioned that Eliza had made a big mistake leaving Arizona's name off the list of good teachers. Eliza insisted that the list was only made to help her remember everyone's names. Arizona wondered why Eliza would not have to learn her name. Eliza then answered, \"That name attached to that face? That's not one you forget.\"\n\nOn Eliza's first day at Grey Sloan, Eliza helped out where she was needed. She then ended up helping Arizona, during which she flirted. Arizona played it cool and acted like she didn't remember their conversation by the elevator. They later agreed to get drinks. However, after Arizona travelled to a prison hospital with Bailey and Jo, and then returned to work on Eliza's official first day, she blew Eliza off, stating that she was too tired. Eliza told her that she only wanted to compliment her on implementing her new teaching method, by allowing Leah to intubate the baby unsupervised.\n\nArizona was later annoyed when Eliza moved one of her surgeries, and accused Eliza of turning everybody against her, but Eliza defended herself by saying that people were simply afraid of change. Arizona blamed Eliza for having Meredith suspended, which surprised Eliza, who was unaware of Meredith's suspension. Later, Arizona was confronted by Eliza in the parking lot, with Eliza claiming while Arizona was acting as though she was against her, she was really afraid of Eliza being fired, as that would mean the pair could pursue a relationship.\n\nWhen Eliza forgot to alert the authorities that Stephanie went missing during the hospital lockdown and explosion, Bailey fired her. When Arizona found her and asked if they could have sex, Eliza said she needed to pack her things since she was fired, leaving Arizona speechless. Arizona then tried to give her some space, but later found out Eliza had left town without saying goodbye, effectively ghosting Arizona.\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nShe met Carina at a bar. She ended up bringing her home and the two had sex.\n\nEven after Andrew came home and interrupted the events, they continued. The next day, when Arizona found out that Carina was at the hospital doing research, she went to see her and Carina continued her flirting.\n\nArizona described the sex the two of them had as pain-relieving.\n\nAfter learning that Sofia was coming back home, Arizona inadvertently broke things off with Carina.\n\nAfter not seeing Arizona for a few days, Carina asked her if she was okay. Arizona said she'd taken a few days off after Karin Taylor's death. Arizona was shocked to learn Carina had never lost a mom, while Carina was shocked to learn Arizona had lost more than one. That inspired Arizona to look into it as a surgical project and once she had written up a proposal, she asked Carina to work on it with her, a decision they sealed with a kiss.\n\nAfter Carina made a comment about moving countries at the drop of a hat, Arizona asked her if she was just going to leave suddenly and end their relationship. Carina said that she had no plans to leave or end their relationship. \n\nWhen Arizona decided she needed to move herself and Sofia back to New York, she ended things with Carina.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nWhen Arizona first worked with Bailey after her arrival at Seattle Grace Hospital, they butted heads when they disagreed over the treatment plan Arizona's predecessor had set for [[Jackson Prescott]], which Bailey had supported. Bailey complained to Richard about Arizona, but he simply told her to work with Arizona because that's who they had. Despite this, Arizona quickly saw Bailey's potential as a pediatric surgeon, claiming she was \"uniquely qualified,\" and supporting her in her decision to apply for a spot in pediatric surgery.\n\nWhen Arizona gave her notice to Chief Bailey in anticipation of moving to New York, Bailey said when she had first met Arizona, she had thought Arizona was a pixie stick, an empty vessel, full of sugar, who skated in a hospital and didn't know then that it would be one of the great privileges of her life to know her and to work with her.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nOn her first day at the hospital, the only person Teddy knew was Owen. They joined Arizona, Mark, and Callie in the cafeteria. After lunch, Teddy and Arizona walked to the ER together. Jackson and Cristina were waiting for Arizona, because their patient was a boy with asthma. Teddy did a little exam and found that the boy had cardiac asthma. She asked for an OR, but Cristina, who had been questioning Teddy's abilities all day, was reluctant. Teddy then made it clear to Cristina that she had to what she said, and left. Arizona smilingly commented that she really liked Teddy. Later, when Arizona noticed Teddy staring mooningly at Owen, Arizona declared that the two of them were going to be friends, going so far as to claim that, \"I'm an awesome friend.\" She suggested that they do a ladies' night.\n\nWhen [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] asked Teddy out, Teddy confided in Arizona, who suggested that Mark was like candy: eat it and forget about it. When things sparked between Mark and Teddy, Arizona was again the one she confided in. When Arizona went to Africa, she and Teddy continued to keep in touch and regularly wrote to each other. When [[Callie Torres|Callie]] became pregnant and asked Arizona to be in, Arizona went to Teddy for advice on whether or not to be in. Arizona arranged ladies night for her after Henry died. Arizona and Teddy continued to keep in touch after Teddy moved to Germany, as Arizona learned about Owen double-dipping from her phone conversation with Teddy. \n\n[[April Kepner]]\nAfter seeing Callie at the [[Puttin' on the Ritz|fundraising gala]], Arizona escaped back to the hospital, where she hid in a supply closet to cry. April found her there and offered comfort, but Arizona kindly sent her away. However, at the party, April overheard Callie tell everyone that Arizona died in the plane crash they were in. Furious at this, she took two bottles of champagne and met Arizona in the hospital storage closet where she was hiding to share a drink and talk. They soon became very open with each other and discussed their relationship problems together, bonding them. April later stood up for Arizona against Callie when Callie mentioned wanting to move back into [[Callie and Arizona's Apartment|their apartment]]. She reminded Callie that Arizona needs the elevator and that it's already retrofitted to be accessible for her.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nRichard and Arizona's relationship started out as a complicated professional one, mainly due to Arizona's authority issues, which would result in her crying whenever the Chief opposed or intimidated her. However, she outgrew those authority issues and they eventually became good friends. Richard accompanied Arizona to a lesbian bar as her wingman and became her go-to person for dating troubles. He was also the one who supported her most during the custody battle and convinced her not to give up.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nAfter becoming Callie's girlfriend, Arizona also became good enough friends with Mark, Lexie, and Cristina. When she returned from Malawi, she asked Callie for a second chance. Callie then revealed that she was pregnant and that Mark was the father. Although initially she was not happy about this development, she decided she was in. However, she developed some resentment towards Mark, which would come to a head after her and Callie\us car crash. Eventually, both Arizona and Mark made up and together with Callie, the three raised Sofia together until Mark's death. When Callie was pregnant Mark and Arizona took an interest in her health and started cooking and trying new recipes together.<ref>[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex Karev and Arizona Robbins started out with a rocky relationship when they first met. But as time went on, Karev realized that Arizona was one of the few people who actually believed in him. Arizona Robbins saw Karev as a promising peds surgeon who was dedicated despite his temper and personal issues and continued to maintain a good mentor-student relationship with him until the end of Alex's residency. Karev's decision to leave [[Seattle]] to take the fellowship offer at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Hopkins]] led her to take his place on a plane that ended up crashing. While she was in the hospital trying to fight the infection in her leg, she mentioned that she was still very much \"pissed off\" and stated that she felt as though Karev should have been in the crash rather than herself, because she spent the whole time thinking about her wife and her baby and he had no wife and no baby; he had no one.\n\nWhen she returned to work, she and Alex maintained their friendship and working relationship with Alex looking out for her. She was unaware that Alex was the surgeon who cut off her leg until years later. Callie didn't tell her because she knew Arizona would hate her and she wanted her to have someone to lean on. When she did find out, she thanked Alex for telling her.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x</ref> While working together with Alex on two equally sick twins and they had to decide which one would get the donor liver they both needed, Arizona had a moment of looking back on her relationship with Alex. The situation reminded Arizona about their first case together and she shared that she was very proud of him and that she trusted him to handle this case well.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nicole Herman]]\nBefore Arizona undertook Nicole's fetal surgery fellowship, they seemed to have a close professional relationship, with Nicole often teasing Arizona about how fetal surgery was more difficult than pediatric surgery. As they began to work together more frequently, they got closer and became less hostile towards each other. They both often jointly spent several nights at the hospital, even going to great lengths as to steal the attendings' lounge sofa together, to continue working on Arizona's crash course. Arizona reached out to Nicole once when Nicole attended \"Blind School,\" but Nicole didn't pick up or call back, leaving Arizona to give up trying to initiate contact. They made up when Nicole returned to Grey Sloan and offered her money to open a center for women's health together.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nOthers\nArizona initially got off on the wrong foot with Dr. Bailey and Karev. Alex couldn't understand how she could be so perky after harvesting organs from a young child. When Dr. Kenley died Dr. Bailey took offense to Arizona changing [[Jackson Prescott|Jackson Prescott's]] course of treatment and proceeded to complain to the Chief and call her an \"infant\". However, Bailey soon realized that Arizona is a competent doctor and grew closer to her after applying for a peds fellowship.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Dr. Robbins at work.]]\n\nFollowing the death of [[Jordan Kenley|Dr. Jordan Kenley]], Dr. Robbins was appointed as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Pediatric Surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She was top of her class and she was the [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]] in her fifth year at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. She then completed her pediatric surgical [[Fellow|fellowship]] at Seattle Grace Hospital.\n\nWhen Bailey and Robbins first worked together, Richard said to Bailey that \"She's the best that anyone's seen in a long time, just like you are\". She is also on a first name basis with the Head of Pediatric Surgery at Johns Hopkins, as she studied under him during her residency.\n\nWhen Arizona won a grant to advance pediatric surgery in less developed countries, she gave her notice and resigned. Later, she returns to Seattle Grace as an attending under [[Robert Stark|Dr. Robert Stark]], the interim Head of Pediatric Surgery. A year later, Arizona resumes her position as the head pediatric surgeon.\n\nShe is very much aware of the nature of her job, Robbins has seen things in pediatric surgery to the extent she has nightmares about the tiny coffins that her patients will be buried in, and so she will remain optimistic in the face of the tragedy involved in her job.\n\nHer optimism and child-friendly abilities can be seen frequently and are also shown as she has cute animals on her lab coat; what appears to be a monkey or a lion above the Seattle Grace logo on the right hand side of her lab coat and a cat above her name and title on the left hand side; and she even wears Heelys at work, heeling around the hospital. When Cristina Yang was put on her service she made Cristina attach a small toy bear, Mr. Bear, to her lab coat and made sure she knew that pediatric surgery was not general surgery in miniature and that Cristina had to like children.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|- residency year]], Arizona decided to start a [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] under [[Nicole Herman|Dr. Nicole Herman]]. Because of brain tumor, Nicole is very harsh on Arizona, as she wants to teach Arizona years worth of fetal surgery knowledge within the six months she has left. She managed to teach Arizona everything from the one-year fellowship in less than half the time, thus making Arizona officially an attending fetal surgeon. When Herman was blind after her tumor resection, Arizona took over being head of fetal surgery.\n\n\n*Arizona wears a Holly Hobbie scrub cap.\n*Arizona likes pizza.\n*She drives a red Volvo S\n*Arizona dislikes sandwiches.\n*Arizona thinks that Sudoku is boring.<ref>[[She's Gone]], x</ref>\n*Prior to her left leg being amputated above the knee, she often wore wheeled sneakers at work.\n*When confronting someone who commands respect and authority, such as [[Daniel Robbins|her father]] or [[Richard Webber|Chief Webber]], she often used to break down and cry, but she seems to have gotten over it throughout the years.\n*When under pressure and in trouble, Arizona smokes cigarettes.<ref>[[Goodbye]], x</ref>\n*Arizona regularly treats patients under the table because she finds it hard to say no to parents of sick babies.\n*When her [[Timothy Robbins|brother]] died, she grieved by eating donuts and crying.\n*When Callie had the chicken pox, Arizona snooped through [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]]'s personnel file to see if she had been vaccinated against the chicken pox, which she had, so she put Lexie in charge of Callie's case.\n*She dislikes pumpkin scones.\n*She went to Malawi after winning a grant. However, this was a dangerous place for her to be as Malawi had strict anti-homosexuality laws at that time. Had she been discovered to be a lesbian, she could have faced up to  years of hard labor if convicted.\n*Arizona's left leg was amputated above the knee following her being in a plane crash.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n*[[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] calls her Mommy.\n*Arizona refers to her patients as tiny humans and to their parents as tiny human makers. \n*She and former patient [[Wallace Anderson]] share the same birthday.<ref>[[Invest in Love]], x</ref>\n*She hates camping.\n*She is the first known attending to have been the Head of two different departments, in this case Pediatric Surgery and Fetal Surgery.\n*During Arizona's third year as a med student, doing an [[Internal Medicine|internal medicine]] [[Clerkship|rotation]], she experienced an HIV-scare due to an incorrect needle retraction while working on an end-stage AIDS patient.\n*When she and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] decided to get pregnant, Arizona started making a list of terrible baby names, which included Raynbow, Bubba, Tulio, Agamemnon, Zamboni, Hashtag, and Digger.

Pretty much everything my father did his whole life was about honoring that sacrifice. I was raised to be a good man in a storm. Raised to love my country, love my family, protect the things I love. When my father, Colonel Daniel Robbins of the United States Marine Corps heard that I was a lesbian, he said he had only one question. I was prepared for, \"How fast can you get the hell out of my house?\" But instead, it was, \"Are you still who I raised you to be?\" My father believed in country the way that you believe in God. And my father is not a man who bends, but he bent for me because I'm his daughter. I'm a good man in a storm. I love your daughter, and I protect the things that I love. Not that I need to.

In oncology, when a normal cell changes into something malignant, it's called cellular transformation. The damn cells turn toxic right in front of your eyes. So as far as I'm concerned transformation sucks. Change is a funny thing, and not everyone can handle it. It can sneak up on you. Things aren't what they used to be. Your whole world has transformed. You realize the ground beneath you has shifted. Things are uncertain and there's no turning back. The world around you is different now. Unrecognizable. And there's nothing you can do about it. You're stuck. Your future is staring you in the face and you're not sure you like what you see. Like I said\u I'm not big into change.|[[Alex Karev]]}}\n\n'''Alex Karev''' is the former [[Chief of Surgery]] at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] and former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of\ua[[Pediatric Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He is the father of twins,\ua[[Alexis Stevens|Alexis]] and [[Eli Stevens|Eli]], with his ex-wife and current partner,\ua[[Izzie Stevens]]. He was also married to\ua[[Jo Wilson]] before learning about Eli and Alexis.\n\n\n\nWhen Alex was seven, he had to start cleaning up his drunk and drug addict father. At that point, he became the adult of the family as his mother was schizophrenic. Alex described himself as being \"raised in a bar\" and that his father never took him to the park or camping.<ref>[[Where the Boys Are]], x</ref>\n\nAs a kid, Alex was fat, and in th or th grade, the other kids started to pick on him for it. He was called names and pranked and even shoved in a locker once. He then started to think of himself as the fat kid in class and the screw-up at home. It was hell for him until the summer after the th grade, when he spent the entire summer school break on his bike riding everywhere. He lost so much weight that people barely recognized him when school started again.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Alex's father left he took care of his mother and his siblings. Alex was in  different foster homes in the course of  years. He also spent time in juvenile detention for stealing food for his family.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Parents]], x</ref> He also admitted his mother into a psychiatric facility at one point. When he was , he stole a car to help his little sister Amber.\n\nAlex lost his virginity to a school nurse when he was .<ref>[[Can't Fight Biology]], \ud</ref>\n\nHe missed his high school prom because his father came home and was drunk and started to break things at the house, so Alex stayed home with him. He had a prom date whom he liked and even got her a bracelet, but he never talked to her again because he felt that he stood her up and thought she wouldn't want to talk to him again.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nAt some point, Alex legally changed his last name to Karev, his mother's maiden name, to disassociate himself from his father, [[James Evans]].\n\nAfter Alex's grandmother died, he had a dream where she told him not to play with his ''parts''.\n\nHe attended college at [[University of Iowa]], where he wrestled.\n\n\nAlex started his internship at the same day [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[George O'Malley|George]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] did. He was at first assigned to a different resident, named Jeremy, than the other four. On his first day, Meredith saved one of his patients from a post-op complication in front of the chief after Alex dismissed the nurse and Meredith several times. He joined Miranda Bailey's service later, after his first resident gave him up for unknown reasons. He didn't get along with his colleagues due to his work attitude. For example, he would only pick the good and interesting cases and steal them from his colleagues. After a few weeks, the other interns learned of his softer, more understanding side and they became friends. Izzie took a particular liking to him and was first to notice the other, nicer side of him.\n\nIn the beginning, he told everyone that his dream specialty was [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]], but after he got to know the specialty closer, Alex discovered that it wasn't for him. He wanted to go into plastics because most of the time the patients there willingly chose their pain. After a longer stint with [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], Alex discovered that he liked to work with infants and began to develop a keen interest in [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]].\n\n\nAlex rescued [[Rebecca Pope|Rebecca]] while she was pregnant during the [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] accident. He also helped her pick a \"new face\" for Dr. Sloan to construct. Because of her new face and because she couldn't remember her real name, Alex nicknamed her Ava. Later on, Rebecca returned and they had a brief relationship during which she believed he got her pregnant (which was investigated by Izzie and turned out to be false). A bit later, under pressure from Izzie, Ava revealed the truth to Alex. Before she came back to Seattle, Ava had developed a borderline personality disorder. A part of this disorder was that she had forgotten that she already had a baby. Alex took care of her during her second stint in Seattle, but he couldn't prevent Ava's suicide attempt. Alex found her in Meredith's kitchen and took her to the ER, where she was treated by Izzie. Izzie pressured Alex to get her admitted to the psych ward. At first, Alex wouldn't allow that and told Izzie that she was \"only going through a bad patch\", and that he could take care of her. After a long talk with Izzie, Alex admitted that Ava needed help and that he couldn't give it to her.\ua\n\n\nAlex and Izzie had a rocky start to their relationship. In the beginning, Izzie disliked him as he was arrogant and cocky. He even plastered her modeling photos around the hospital to humiliate her. Izzie eventually saw the softer side of him and they had an on and off relationship. Alex and Izzie got married after a tumor was removed from her brain, but a second one was found by [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Shepherd]]. Izzie made a treatment error that endangered the life of a patient, and she ended up getting fired from the Surgical Program. She believed that her getting fired was partially Alex's fault, so she wrote him a Dear John letter and left Seattle. Then, she returned and attempted to get back together with Alex, but he refused because of the fact that she had left him, and they ultimately got divorced.\n\n\nAlex got shot in the lower chest by [[Gary Clark]] upon discovering him standing over Reed's body. After Gary had walked off, Alex dragged himself onto an elevator and got discovered by Mark and Lexie. They took him to an empty conference room and put in a chest tube.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref> Alex thought he was dying and advised Mark to have more sex and eat more bacon. Lexie confessed her love for him as he received a blood transfusion, but Alex mistook her for Izzie. He told her he was happy that she came back for him and asked her not to leave him again. Soon after, they were evacuated by a SWAT member and transported to [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital|Seattle Pres]], where [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] operated on him.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlex and his fellow fourth year residents began the race for the position of chief resident. Alex initially fell behind in the race because he didn't have any projects to work on while his peers were going off on their own. However, an idea was planted into his head when he joined Robbins in looking at scans of a patient in need of surgery. When he asked if he could scrub in, Robbins informed him that the child was in Africa and wouldn't be getting the surgery because she needed to stay to care for [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|her own sick child]] who was in the NICU at the time.\uaIt would cost too much to fly him out herself and she was at a loss as to getting someone who was willing to bring that kid, plus the dozen others, to the US for surgery.\n\nLater, when prompted by Owen about his plans for chief resident, Alex impulsively blurted out a plan to bring over a group of African kids for much needed surgeries.\uaFrom that point, Alex committed himself to the Africa Project, despite a rocky start.\uaHe initially presented his plan to Dr. Stark, asking for the help and money he needed to get the project off the ground. Stark denied him, however, because despite all of Alex's good intentions, he wasn't good at organizing the logistic part of the project, coming off as disorganized and \"half-assed\", according to Stark.\n\nResorting to Plan B, Alex went to one of his rich patients, [[Gladys Pulcher]], who was suffering from late stage lung cancer. Pulcher, dubbed \"Dragon Lady\" by Alex because of her constant cold and mean spirited remarks, refused and threatened to sue him and the hospital. Alex persisted, however, going as far as to show her pictures of the many sick kids before she sent him away. She asked for him later when Lexie was having trouble moving her without causing pain. He refused to help unless she agreed to give him money for his project.\uaShe agreed and Alex walked away victorious. His glee was short lived as Pulcher coded and died soon after.\n\nDespite the financial setback, Alex proceeded with his plans, first charging his credit cards and then giving \"I owe you\" promises until the children were set to arrive. Frantic and crumbling under the pressure of owing so much money and living up to the expectations he had set up for these kids, Alex nearly had a meltdown. He attempted to run away from the problem, ignoring Lexie who was hounding him about the debt, and instead, focusing on helping the kids.\uaHowever, a check came in the mail just in time from the lawyer handling the estate of Gladys Pulcher, giving Alex two hundred thousand dollars and essentially funding the project.\n\nThe children arrived and the surgeons of Seattle Grace Mercy West were able to give them their surgeries successfully. The project put Alex as the front runner in the race for chief resident.\n\nThe project was temporarily threatened when a new doctor, [[Mel Barnett|Dr. Mel Barnett]], took over for Robbins while she recovered after the plane crash and her amputation.\uaAccording to Barnett, the project didn't fit in his agenda for pediatrics and would have been shipped over to a different hospital. This, however, did not happen as Alex stayed in Seattle instead of going to Baltimore to do his fellowship at Johns Hopkins.\n\n\nWhen Meredith was working on Derek's Alzheimer's trial, Alex spotted her walking down the hall with a trial packet under her lab coat. She convinced him not to rat her out for a while, saying \"Nothing I did changes anything.\" However, the race for chief resident was on and when Meredith became a top contestant, Alex told Hunt what he saw her do while drinking at Joe's. Meredith retaliated by kicking Alex out of her house, despite his many apologies. When Richard found out that she switched the packets so Adele would receive the active ingredient, he decided to take the fall for her and Meredith was able to keep her job and she eventually forgave Alex.\n\n\nWhen the residents first began applying for [[Fellow|fellowships]], Alex was concerned because the interviews Robbins lined up were all at second rate hospitals. However, he soon discovered that Robbins was only doing this to convince him to stay at Seattle Grace Mercy West, and began to get calls from the country's top hospitals. He verbally committed to staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West and being Arizona's fellow. However, after [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] created a fellowship spot just for him, he decided to take that spot, angering Arizona and leading her to take his spot on the plane that ultimately crashed. His guilt over her replacing him led him to agree to stay in [[Seattle]] while she recovered, even amputating her leg himself when the time came. After delaying his move to Johns Hopkins for months, he eventually decided to stay in Seattle and take Arizona's fellowship.\n\n\nAlex and Jo begin dating after them both denying their feelings for each other. Jo and Alex fight over his father, but Alex realizes Jo was doing it because she loved him. They both were in foster care growing up. Alex proposes although Jo does not realize that that's what he was doing until he introduces her as his fianc\uee. When the board introduces the non fraternization policy, they fake a break up. Meredith finds a solution in a love contract, which they both have to sign, which states that their relationship is consensual.\n\nAlex didn't have an easy relationship with his father, [[James Evans]]. James abused Alex, his mother, and his siblings when they were young. James struggled all his life with a drug and alcohol addiction. At age , Alex stood up to his father, beat him up, and threw him out of the house. Alex later admitted to a patient that he had gone too far.\n\nYears later, Alex met his father again at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] after James was admitted to the ER. James and two of his friends were in a car crash and they were obviously on some drugs. It is later confirmed that the drug of his choice is heroin. After Alex recognized his father, he couldn't find the courage to speak with him in the hospital. After James was discharged, Alex tracked him down in a bar, but still couldn't find the courage to talk to him. Alex visited the bar the night after his initial visit and after a few drinks, he got into a fight with his father once again. After that fight, James recognized Alex as his son. He said he recognized Alex because of his angry eyes, which were the same when Alex was . After that incident, Alex left James for good. A while later, James came back to the hospital after quitting the drugs cold turkey. He said to [[Jo Wilson|Jo]] that he wanted to get clean for his family. At first, Alex declined to help him. After a while and a little push from Jo, Alex made up his mind and at least tried to help and talk to his dad.\n\nAfter [[Shane Ross|Shane]] froze while operating on James's heart, Alex was angry at Shane and tried to make his dad happy. He even went so far to lie to James's [[Naomi Evans|second ex-wife]] to get her to visit James. When James died, Alex was relieved and sad at the same time. Shane tried to apologize to Alex, but he was still angry at him and Alex beat him up in front of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Jo Wilson|Jo]]. Alex only stopped because Meredith held him back.\n\n\nAlex left GSM temporarily to join a private practice with [[Oliver Lebackes]]\uafor the purpose of making enough money to pay off his medical school debts. When\ua[[Maggie Pierce|Pierce]] accidentally revealed in the OR that Alex was looking for a spot on the board, Lebackes fired him on the spot. Even though he didn't get the spot, GSM hired him back as an attending peds surgeon.\n\n\nWhen surgical intern Andrew DeLuca was helping Jo get into bed after a night of drinking, Alex walked in and saw Andrew on top of her. Assuming that Andrew was sexually assaulting her, Alex violently physically assaulted Andrew, leading to the former temporarily injuring his hand and the latter sustaining several critical injuries. When Meredith figured out that Alex was the one who had caused the damage to Andrew, she promised not to tell anyone, even going to the extent to lie to her colleagues about Alex's guilt.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew decided to press charges, Alex and his attorney thought it was for a misdemeanor, but quickly learned that the state had upped the charge to felony assault. Alex pled not guilty, When Bailey found out that one of her attending pediatric surgeons was charged with a felony, she was forced to suspend him from the surgical staff and offered him a position in the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]], which he accepted.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref> While working in the clinic, he had to get surgical consults, as he did not have surgical privileges. This, as well as being supervised by a nurse, led to Alex being quite frustrated with his temporary assignment.<ref>[[Falling Slowly]], x</ref>\n\nThe day before the trial, Alex talked to Meredith and Maggie about how it was his \"last day on earth,\" and how they needed to drink that evening, despite Meredith's assurance that the trial would go well. After learning that Jo was married, which she was worried about being discovered during the trial, Alex decided to take the plea deal, which involved him serving two years.<ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\nAlex went to the District Attorney's office to take the plea deal, but Andrew unexpectedly walked in and tried to drop all charges against Alex. When he was told that since the case belonged to the state, he could not do that, he threatened to sabotage the case, which the attorney said was \"a slam dunk.\" Andrew walked out before Alex could understand why he decided to drop the charges. The two eventually had a conversation outside of the hospital in which Andrew says that he did it to protect Jo, and expressed frustration that Alex never apologized when he had the chance. After a meeting, Bailey offered to reinstate Alex with full surgical privileges once she received the papers showing that the charges had been dropped.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlex tracked down Jo's husband, [[Paul Stadler]], and spied on him at a medical conference. He told Meredith that he planned to confront Paul, but never actually spoke to him. He later revealed to Jo that he saw Paul but didn't act violently towards him like Jo thought he would. Alex and Jo then got back together after Jo realized that she could trust him. Soon after, she invited him to move back into the loft by holding up a sign reading \"Homecoming?\", a move inspired by a shared patient.\n\nJo found herself hesitant to be included in an article about Meredith's surgery, as it showcased how much control her husband still had over her. When presented with the opportunity to become Chief Resident, she decided she was done hiding and filed for divorce from Paul. On her first day as Chief Resident, Jo was shocked when Paul showed up at the hospital with the divorce papers. Meredith stepped in and told Alex to stay away from Paul as he wanted to beat the guy up, so she helped Jo handle the divorce. The next day, Paul was brought in after a hit-and-run, which Meredith incorrectly\uafirst suspected was Alex and Jo's doing. Alex stayed clear of Paul's room per Meredith's instructions, but he stood by Jo as she was left with the decision about what to do with Paul after he slipped in an act of aggression towards Jo and his new fianc\uee Jenny and was declared brain dead. She chose to donate his organs and was overwhelmed with relief to finally be free.\n\n\nAlex came home and Jo was waiting for him. Jo started to say that she never fit in\uaanywhere and that's why she always ran. She continued to say that maybe she ran from anyone who ever loved her. Alex paused her and started to look for the ring. He couldn't find it because Jo was already wearing it. Jo knelt down in front of Alex and said she didn't want to go anywhere without him and he is her home. She asked if he wanted to marry her. He said yes.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nAfter months of being engaged, Alex and Jo arrived at the big day. However, everything that could go wrong, did. While the wedding was delayed by people going to the wrong address and minister being late, Alex and Jo snuck off to have sex in a shed and got locked in. When they were finally saved by Meredith and Andrew, they returned to the wedding site to find their wedding planner having a serious allergic reaction. The final straw was when [[Levi Schmitt]]\uafainted at the sight of blood and knocked over the wedding cake. Alex and Jo decided to get married at sea on a ferryboat, with their ceremony being officiated by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile on their honeymoon in Los Angeles, Jo talked about an article she had read on cancer cells. It felt new to her, while Boston didn't. Alex said he wouldn't mind for their kids to grow up in Boston. Jo then said she had a thought and ran off from the beach.\n[[File:xAlexKarev.png|thumb|Jo needs to work on her idea.]]\nThinking he had talked about kids too fast, he found her at a beach bar and apologized. She told him at wasn't about the kids. She had an idea and she needed to focus, so she asked him to shut up while she was writing things down on a napkin. The bartender treated Alex to a beer on the house. Jo retreated back to their hotel room, while Alex spent the day enjoying himself outside. When he came back, Jo presented him with her idea to design cancer killer cells by introducing suicide genes in the cancer cell DNA. She feared he hated her for ruining her the honeymoon, but he was just delighted that she agreed to marry him and commented that their kids would be very smart.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nThey returned to Seattle the next day and they talked to Meredith about creating a surgical innovation fellowship just for Jo. Meredith took the idea to Bailey, who told her there was no room on the budget unless she did not re-hire Alex, as they had just spent a lot of money on the hyperbaric medicine lab. Meredith then told Jo to go to Boston and come back when they found the money, but Jo had already turned Boston down by that point. Both out of a job, they went to Joe's for day drinking. Jo revealed she had only applied for Boston because she could, but she did not really want to move there as it felt like going backwards. Jo then decided to go back to Bailey and explain why she was the future of medicine. The meeting was very productive for the couple. Bailey decided to fund the fellowship with her own money and appointed Alex interim Chief of Surgery, as she herself needed a sabbatical. Meredith was not happy about the move but Alex told her she still got him around this way and that it was time for Jo to move on to her own stuff.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|As Chief, Alex throws Richard off his patient's case.]]\nAlex was thrown in the deep end of the pool on his first day as Chief. He signed off on Link's project to -D print prosthetics for kids. Alex feared that Bailey only picked him because he would never live up to her, so that she would be welcomed back with open arms after her sabbatical, but she told him that she did trust him to do the job. However, he messed up the OR board, missed appointments with his peds patients, and later butted heads with Richard when he wouldn't stop berating a supposedly drunk patient. He found some comfort with Meredith, who told him that every Chief always feel like they're pissing people off and doing a poor job. At the end of the day, Alex fired Vik when he lost a patient due to not taking his nosebleed seriously and did not take responsibility for it. Bailey checked on his work and found that he had spent the entire quarter's budget in one day. Jo left them to talk so they could correct his mistake.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAlex hated the job because everyone kept asking for stuff, including his wife. He froze some funding he had approved earlier, including Link's project. Alex got himself a case of a [[Julius Guerra|young man]] with a pulmonary bleb, but the man refused surgery because his insurance wouldn't cover it. Alex paged Richard for advice, but he refused to do Alex's job for him. He only told him being Chief is finding creative ways to get out of corners you've been backed into. Alex wanted to quit, but Richard told him you only quit when you've tried something to the best of your abilities, otherwise it's just failing. Alex then get creative and made a small cut in the patient's chest so that the surgery would qualify as a trauma surgery. Richard yelled at him, but Alex told him about the time when he was  and he stole his neighbor's car to drive his sister, who was spiking a fever, to the hospital. Like Alex had hoped, the patient was happy to have his bleb removed and wouldn't report it. Alex was delighted to have found his groove as Chief. While heading home, Alex and Jo ran into Link, who apparently knew Jo from her past life as Brooke.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nAlex found out that Link and Jo had worked together waiting tables and that he was like a brother to her, but Alex gave him the cold shoulder while they working together on [[Rafi Elshami]]. Link noticed his threatening and dismissive demeanor and assured him that he and Jo had not been involved romantically. Alex then revealed that his problem was that Link had not protected her from Paul like a good brother would have. Link said he tried to tell her that he did not like Paul, but then Paul grew jealous and made Jo back away. He thought he was being respectful in honoring the distance, but he would not have if he had known that Paul was abusing her. Alex then warmed up to him. While he was catching up on paperwork after the surgery, Jo came by and he told her that Link was a great guy. He and Jo then started doing honeymoon things in the office.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nJo started helping Alex out a bit at work because the workload made him grumpy all the time. Jo and Bailey revived a liver with a perfusion system, but Alex ordered them to shut it down because it could risk their standing with UNOS. He later operated with Meredith on [[Flor Medina]] and they discussed Meredith's father's impending death from AML. He advised her to go see him, because he found it had been good for him to be able to say goodbye to his own father. After the surgery, he found out that Jo and Bailey had gone against his orders and were performing a transplant with the revived liver. While angry at first, the transplant worked, so he then took Jo into his office and admitted to being turned on by her genius. They closed the blinds in his office when they wer spotted kissing by [[Frankie Shavelson|nurse Frankie]]. That night, they invited Link to the loft so Jo could properly cut his hair and Meredith came over, too, when she found herself in need of company. She took over from Jo and Alex and Jo agreed that Meredith and Link looked good together.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWhen nurse Frankie got in distress, Alex found that the entire nursing staff was worried about her and assisted Richard in surgery. Alex delivered the baby and took care of him himself so as to provide the best possible care. Alex himself had to call time on death on Frankie as Richard wouldn't give up. Her baby survived and was watched closely by a group of nurses.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nAlex and Jo overslept on the day that a wind storm hit Seattle. They jumped out of bed to leave for work, but found that the storm made it unsafe to leave their house. Alex then had Bailey cover him. He found out how understaffed the hospital was, making him feel like a crappy leader. To cheer him up, Jo decided they could have a second honeymoon while staying in. Alex struggled to get reception so he had a hard time staying up to date with business at the hospital. He and Jo discovered neither of them had mailed in their marriage license, meaning their marriage wasn't official yet. They then went through all their wedding gifts. April had registered for them so they ended up with a bunch of stuff they didn't need. They agreed to return most of it and buy a bigger television with the money they'd get back. They then resorted to drink beer out of fancy glasses and making out.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nAs soon as he heard the bridge had been re-opened, Alex left for work. He caught Levi and Nico getting dressed after sex in an ambulance and was ordered by Bailey to step in for her in harvesting [[Phoebe Moss|Phoebe Moss']] organs so she could go take care of the hospital. He later confronted her about the way she had spoken to him. Bailey admitted that she was in crisis back then and didn't trust herself to finish the surgery. She told him she still needed more time to work on herself and asked him not to quit. He agreed not to and help her out in any way she needed. He later called out Nico and Levi for what they did and directed them to rooms with doors that lock.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAlex settled in the Chief job and got the hang of it. When Teddy was looking for a job, Bailey referred her to Alex, who made her audition for Maggie. Jo had been treating [[Natasha Deon]] all day and thanked Alex for being alive and having married her. Alex heard about Andrew stepping up and performing a solo surgery when Owen was accidentally paralyzed in the OR and congratulated him on pulling it off.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex and Jo get in a festive mood.]]\nWith the holidays approaching, Alex chose to gift everyone on staff a ham. He and Jo organized a navy blue scrubs only NYE party at their loft. The two of them handed out beers before the countdown and kissed at midnight. At work, Alex came up with an idea to give Natasha and [[Garrett Boland]] the wedding under the stars they had always wanted. Meredith officiated with all doctors holding up their phones with images of stars on display.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nAs Chief, Alex decided to initiate a weekly free breakfast for the interns in the cafeteria. At the same time, a gallery with pictures of all past and present Chiefs was installed there. Jo made him pose next to his photo and sent a picture to [[Helen Karev]] to show her how far her son had come. Bailey found herself bugged by Alex's picture on there and reminded him of the time he wanted to step down but she still needed time. Now, she felt ready to return. However, Alex told her he had gotten good at the job and that he wanted to keep the job till the end of the six-month contract they had agreed to. Begrudgingly, she told him she was proud of him for standing up for himself.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith was breaking her longest surgery record, Alex had to navigate a flood of overdose patients. He and Jo treated a woman who lost her kid in the chaos at the park where the overdoses originated, only to later discover that she had taken her kid to the park so she could score some drugs. Reminding him of the time his father left him in a parking lot when he was six, Alex had a strong reaction to the situation and told the kid's father to do whatever he needed to to protect his son, even if it meant keeping him away from his mother. Jo later brought Alex a cup of hot chocolate to comfort him and he told her he loved her.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex is surprised by his mother's visit.]]\nOn the day of Catherine's party, Meredith told Alex about her and Andrew dating. After mocking her a bit, as a friend, he was happy for her, and as Chief, he told her to inform HR. He then got ready to leave. Taryn came in to tell him that \"Mrs. Karev\" wanted to see it. He thought she was talking about Jo and told her to tell Jo to meet him at the party. Alex was the first to arrive at the party and indulged in appetizers and ping-pong while mocking Jackson about his ridiculously huge and luxurious penthouse. Having ignored his phone, Alex was surprised when Jo showed up at the party with his mother, who claimed she just came by for a visit. While he and Jo discussed their suspicion of a psychotic break and planned to her back to their loft, Helen disappeared into the crowd. They eventually found her and Helen showed Alex a bag of scarfs she had knitted as a wedding present. He picked the green one as it was his favorite color as a child.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex introduces Helen to Meredith.]]\nHe then tried to reach his mom's doctor, but he couldn't reach them. He hated that a mere visit could be a sign of a split from reality. Now that she was doing fine, he didn't know what the warning signs were anymore, unlike in his childhood. He and Jo watched Helen knit and decided to wait until tomorrow to find out what was going on. He later went to tell her that her visit threw him, but it meant a lot to him. Helen was the first to detect the smell of smoke. Alex thought it was another sign and tried to keep her calm while she urged everyone to get out, disturbing the celebratory toast. However, she turned out to be right and they evacuated the penthouse with the other characters. Out on the street, Alex introduced his mother to Meredith, who confirmed she and Alex were each other's best friend. Alex and Jo then took Helen home and helped her get settled on their couch. Despite her being right about the fire, they still were not convinced she was okay.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex has doubts about approving Vincenzo's research.]]\nJo and Alex took Helen with them to the hospital to show her around. She had been knitting baby hats ever since Alex told her they wanted kids. Before heading into back-to-back meetings, he asked Bailey to cover the ER. She commented she was counting down the  days before she could stop taking orders from him. His first meeting was with [[Vincenzo DeLuca]], Andrew, and Carina. Vincenzo wanted to start research about gestational sacks. Seeing potential, Alex asked for two days to consider, although he was inclined to say. However, Meredith warned him to dig into Vincenzo's past, though she kept his mental illness a secret so as to not break Andrew's trust.\n\nAlex took Helen to a park for lunch. He hated that he didn't come up with Vincenzo's idea of his own. They talked about his childhood. As a -year-old, he once asked her what the inside of a doorknob looked like. She took one apart to show and he wouldn't let her put it back together until he one day did it himself. So, she thought he would be an engineer. He said he was more of a fixer than an innovator, but she disagreed. She had always been in awe of his brain. Alex then brought up the baby hats that freaked out Jo. Helen says she only meant to give Jo a little nudge. Carina eventually informed Alex about her father's mental illness. He didn't want to say no because of that given his experience with his mother, so he approved to provide funding for the research. Later, Jo told him she freaked out not because of him but because she didn't know anything about her genome and her biological parents' medical history, so she decided to have her genome examined.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Alex was hopeful about the DeLuca research, Bailey thought he had stared a moral slippery slope that she would have to handle soon. When a lamb died in one of the sacks, Carina thought it best to remove her father, who downplayed the death, from the research as it as too important to let it be screwed up by him, but Andrew disagreed. After a talk with Helen, Bailey came to tell Alex that Helen had been sticking around longer than planned because she was too scared to go home by herself and she didn't dare to ask for help. Teddy then paged Alex to tell him Vincenzo had pitched his research to help out a pregnant couple at risk of losing their baby. Alex, Carina, and Teddy had to deliver the news to the hopeful parents that they could not approve that procedure on humans yet and instead had to deliver the baby while doing the hysterectomy so it could pass away in its father's arms. Alex then called the DeLucas into his office and told them Vincenzo's major breach of protocol and reckless behavior had convinced him to stop the research. Furious, Vincenzo took his research back to Italy. While attending a fish fry hosted by Richard on the roof, Alex asked Bailey to cover for him while he flew back to Iowa with his mother. He and Helen said goodbye to Jo and left for the airport.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\n\nJo decided to seek out her biological family in Pittsburgh. Once she got there, she stopped answering his calls, worrying him. He spent the day working with Andrew, who was shutting Meredith out ever since the failed research project with his father. They were to perform a total pancreatectomy. Andrew thought Meredith had asked Alex to put him on the case to cheer him up and said he didn't need any favors. The patient, [[Nora Hillridge]], was sabotaging her own surgery by drinking juice to increase her glycemia so that she could stay in the hospital and wouldn't have to go back to school. The doctors found out and Andrew went a bit overboard in his attempts to convince Nora's mother to make her daughter get the surgery. Alex then threw Andrew off the case, but Andrew went to talk to Nora behind his back and convinced her to consent to the surgery by talking about how he overcame being bullied. Alex then performed the surgery behind Andrew's back to punish him for not obeying his orders. Andrew later confronted him about that move and Alex told him that he was letting the stuff with his father interfere with his job and relationship. He told Andrew not to bite people's hand when they reach out because then they stop reaching out. Alex then went home and found Jo in bed. He told her he missed her and got ready for bed, not noticing in the dark that she was crying and only pretending to be asleep.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nShe didn't talk to him about what had happened and started to avoid him, leaving for work while he was in the shower. It was his last day of Chief and he confronted her about not telling him what happened, but she gave some vague answer about needing Bailey for a fellowship grant and left. At the end of the day, he asked her to go out to celebrate his no longer being Chief, but she wanted to crawl into bed after the rough day she had. He wanted to join, but she needed to be alone and told him to go celebrate with Meredith. He once again told her she could tell him anything as he wouldn't judge given his own family history. She firmly stated she did not want and could not talk about it. She then went home by herself.<ref>[[Silent All These Years]], x</ref>\n\nFor a week, Jo pretended to be sick and did not go back to work. He knew she was lying, but she continued to completely shut him out and lie in bed all day. He went to work in a suit, something he had grown to like as Chief. Bailey paged him to ask about the compliance reports due tomorrow, but he had no idea what she was talking about. Alex took the case of [[Gus Carter]], a kid with autism that the doctors had to communicate with through LEGO blocks. Alex then reached out to Link to find out if he knew anything, but Link didn't even know she had looked up her birth mother. Alex then asked him to go over to his loft and distract her. The doctors diagnosed Gus with a thymoma, which was compromising his immune system, but they couldn't operate until they had transfused him to cure his anemia. However, the transfusion went badly and they discovered he had the extremely rare Rh blood type, meaning he could only receive blood from the exact same type. That meant that they had to put off the surgery until they found a match. Alex then received a text from Link. He rushed to the loft and found Jo laughing hysterically at a cartoon. Alex thought she was doing better, but Link told her she was in a rough shape, unlike anything he'd ever seen before. He was sure she needed help, but he did not know how to do that.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nAlex managed to get Jo to agree to come back to work. He urged all of his colleagues not to make a big deal out of it. Meredith found him and told him she tried with [[Cristina Yang]] and [[Marie Cerone]] if they could help out for Gus's blood, but to no avail. Alex then told her Jo still wasn't talking. He was afraid Jo had finally broken and would leave him, like all his previous lovers had done. Meredith assured him that she wouldn't. She just wasn't ready to talk yet. Later, he heard she came to work drunk and confronted her about it at home. Angrily, he told her he was done being told to leave her alone if he loved her and he threatened to go to Pittsburgh himself to find out what had happened. She told him she would talk when she was ready to and that she'd leave him if he threatened to go Pittsburgh ever again. They then made a deal that he would report her to Bailey if she came to work drunk again, so she promised she wouldn't.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nJo was assigned to monitor Gus while Alex and Meredith took on the case of [[Gabriella Rivera]], a kid with an obstruction that required surgery. Gabriella's father was an immigrant cleaning offices for a living and he made too much money to qualify for state coverage for the surgery, which was too expensive for Luis to pay. Meredith then put Ellis's name down on the paperwork. Before they headed into surgery, Jo found Alex and told him she had found a donor for Gus. He called her a good luck charm and gave her instructions to prepare Gus for surgery. After Gabriella's surgery, during which they found cancer, Alex found Jo sobbing in [[Lori Carter|Lori Carter's]] arms. Alex took Jo away and found out she had mistaken a phone call from someone calling to see if Gus could donate blood as someone responding to their needing a donor. Alex met with Bailey in her office and vented his despair over the situation, not knowing what to do with Jo.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAlex then made arrangements with Meredith so that she could stay at the loft to get through to Jo while he helped out Amelia and Maggie with her kids. They finally found a donor for Gus from London. Alex sent Levi to go pick up the donor, who was severely agoraphobic, at the airport. However, when her therapist was arrested by customs for a problem with his visa, [[Frances Pinfield]] fled back onto the plane and refused to leave. Alex then sent Owen to help Levi out. Gus's parents grew frustrated while waiting. In between, Alex checked in on Gabby, who was doing well and spending time Andrew. Soon after, Gus had a heart attack and they managed to pull him through, but the need for transfusion only increased. While in the room, Owen FaceTimed Alex so Frances could meet Gus and his parents to convince her to get off the plane. That worked, but the car got stuck on the highway due to fog covering the city. With Gus's number rapidly worsening to the point of impending organ failure, Alex decided to took Gus to the hyperbaric chamber to guarantee maximum oxygen. Meredith, having reached a breakthrough with Jo, joined him in the chamber so they could talk.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith informs Alex on what has been going on with Jo.]]\nMeredith told him that Jo was the product of rape and that she had been told she looked just like her father, which sent her into a depression. Meredith had convinced her to get a proper leave of absence so she could ge the help she needed. The news made Alex think about the day she left for Pittsburgh. He was worried about what she'd find, but she told him that the worst that could happen was that her mother did not want to see her and then she'd just come home to him and at least she'd know. He thought he should have stopped her, but Meredith told him he couldn't have. She also told him he had tried to help her as best as he could, but she needed professional help. While in there, they were informed that the insurance company had found out about Meredith's insurance fraud and that Andrew was taking the fall for her. Meredith couldn't stop him since she was stuck in the chamber, where Gus started coding again. Alex started CPR and started to lose it, saying Jo had disappeared and now Meredith would be going to jail, leaving him all alone. Meredith told him he wasn't alone yet and took over. They pulled Gus through and Jo arrived with the blood right when the chamber was decompressed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex is fired along with Richard and Meredith for covering up the latter's insurance fraud.]]\nWhile Meredith took Gus away, Jo finally told Alex that she was not okay. She knew how to rise when she had to, but she needed help. Alex promised her they would figure it out. Richard then came to get Alex for Meredith's problems. The two of them went to back her in the meeting with Bailey and Catherine, which led to all three of them being fired by Bailey. Afterwards, Alex went to make sure Gus was fine, and then took Jo to the in-patient psychiatry ward. He said goodbye to her with a kiss and watched her check herself in. Bailey stood by him and as they left, he asked if he was really fired. She said it hurt her more than it did him.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAfter dropping Jo off at the psychiatric department, Alex went out for drinks with Link to inform him about Jo. Alex confessed he was scared that the treatment wouldn't work, as it had failed to help many other people in his life with psychiatric problems. Link told him Jo was a fighter and that she would come out stronger. However, when she did come out a week later, they decided to commit her to a -day program at a psychiatric facility. Alex dropped her off. Before heading in, she said she didn't want to be another name on his list of crazy people. He was convinced she would come out fine, but she reminded him that they weren't legally married and that she would understand if he were to take that out. He didn't reply and she headed into the facility.\n\nTwo weeks later, they met with Jo's doctor present. She told him that when he tried to talk to her in her depressive episode, she felt fear, shame, and pain. She was ashamed that she was unable to receive the love that he was giving her. She pushed him away and feared that she would never be able to regain his trust. Alex admitted he was scared, too. She knew he had had enough crazy for a lifetime and that he deserved more than someone weak who breaks like glass. The doctor said she was actually stronger than most for coming to the facility, but Alex didn't answer.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n\nA week later, Richard came by for a visit and noticed that Alex's life had fallen apart with Jo gone. He suggested Alex apply for the Chief of Surgery job at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] so he could hire him. Alex was hesitant, but Richard pointed out his life was a mess and that he needed to give Jo a reason to come back home. Alex then gathered himself and applied for the job, which he got. He then went to pick up Jo at the facility. He got down on knee and admitted he had thought about leaving because he was scared, but he had realized he was stronger with her by his side. He didn't care that she wasn't magically cured and proposed to her again, which she accepted.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOn Jo's first day back to work, Alex offered Jo a job at Pac-North so she could start with a clean slate, even allowing her to run her own fellowship. On Richard's first day at Pac-North as director of the general surgery program, he came to complain to Alex about the two only residents being terrible and to demand an office. Alex reminded him of the hospital's terrible rankings and the need to turn the place around. While the hospital's CT was down, the ER was flooded, including patients from Meredith's work crew. He called her to tell her to stop doing that and then checked in with Jo, who told him that Bailey made her the exact same offer as him. He then countered with an offer to make her general surgeon as he needed the extra hands. Alex was pulled onto an emergent case with Richard of a man who nearly died in the ER's waiting room. During surgery, Richard talked about missing working at Grey Sloan as he had imagined himself dropping dead one day in OR , which made him happy. They managed to save the patient. Afterwards, Alex told Richard that he had dreaded working at Pac-North, too, given the legacy he inherited at Grey Sloan from Bailey and Richard himself. However, he was convinced that they would be able to turn this place around so that failure was no longer the culture there and made Richard see that it could provide him with a new legacy other than dropping dead in Grey Sloan's OR. He came home to Jo, who told him she had used his offer to demand the attending position at Grey Sloan. Alex understood it was the better move for her and congratulated her.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nTogether, they started turning the place around. Alex arranged a new MRI machine for the hospital but they had to wait for the right software in order to be able to use it. A tough situation arose for Alex when Richard accidentally took a misidentified patient off of life support.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref> Alex was amused when Meredith's article came out, inadvertently trashing Grey Sloan specifically instead of the medical system itself. With the basics at Pac-North set straight, Alex and Richard started teaching the two residents at the hospital. He ran into Owen, who delivered a patient who had refused to be treated at Grey Sloan because of the article, and offered to give him a tour after learning he had taken up paternity leave to avoid having to work under [[Tom Koracick]]. During their tour, they came across a woman shouting for help from the ICU as one of the residents failed to deliver adequate help to her hemorrhaging husband. Alex and Owen jumped in and took the man to the OR, where they talked about the situation at Grey Sloan. Alex acknowledged that Bailey, like everyone else there, didn't deserve to work under Tom and inquired if Owen was tired of sitting at home yet. Alex then offered him the position of Head of Trauma Surgery, allowing him to structure the department as he saw fit. Owen accepted the position.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOne day after work, Alex came home and learned Jo had had a rough day. She didn't want to talk about it. He didn't want her to keep it inside like before. Instead, she started to throw toys at the wall to calm herself down, which she had learned worked for her while being treated for her depressive episode. She invited Alex to join her and he admitted it felt satisfying.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Jo tried to scare Alex while he was getting ready for work but he was too occupied with his meeting with investors that day. Alex and Richard led the group around the hospital. To distract them from a chaotic ER, Alex wanted to take them to the construction site of the new research wing, which was on budget and ahead of schedule, but a construction worker came to get him for something he had to see first. Alex left the group in Richard's hands and went with the worker, who showed him they had come across skeletal remains while digging. They discovered it was a mass grave, a remnant of the hospital's past as a psychiatric facility, and decided to stop construction. Alex informed Richard, who took it upon himself to keep the investors busy while Alex handled the administrative load. Jo showed up with fake blood in another attempt to scare Alex but he was informed that multiple patients were crashing in the ICU. Jo suggested the hospital was haunted, which started a rumor amongst the nurses. Alex and Owen traced the source of the problem back to a broken fridge in the ICU's blood supply. He issued an order to only use Central Blood Supply from that point forward. Afterwards, Alex overheard the gossip and loudly announced the authorities had been informed about the mass grave while assuring everyone the hospital was not haunted. His announcement came right when Richard walked in the with the investors. Alex took the investors to his office and explained the situation properly. They were impressed with his ability to handle chaos and approved more funding. Jo dropped by his office and he wanted to celebrate the good news with her. He thought it was a good time to get legally married and they went to the courthouse. During her vows, she finally managed to scare him by claiming she was pregnant. She set the record straight and the ceremony continued.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, Maggie arrived at Pac-North with Richard's brother and niece, who needed surgery to remove a myxoma. Alex granted Maggie privileges so she could perform the surgery there and introduced her the stuff, expressing his hopes that she might decide to come work there, which had worked before. Maggie lost the patient and panicked as she had convinced the family to let her operate against their initial wishes. Alex comforted her and let her vent her feelings before they went to inform Richard and his brother together.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nAlex took the day off for Meredith's hearing before the medical commission and was one of the few people to follow the entire hearing. He testified that Meredith made him a better surgeon and person. When the prosecutor brought up the delay in Zola's adoption, Alex refrained from mentioning her kidnapping but the prosecutor pressed him and asked if it had anything to do with her brief firing at the time. Alex hesitated and wondered why Meredith's family was relevant to the hearing. [[Paul Castello]] pointed out she seemed pretty cavalier about the law in both her professional and personal life. Meredith then saved Alex from having to answer by lashing out at Paul, the man who had killed Derek, for not remembering her and thus not having the right to judge her. Paul then had a seizure and was taken away. The judge wanted to postpone the hearing but Alex loudly objected. He had brought together a whole group of people who had been treated by Meredith and had all come from all over the country to testify on her behalf. He had also gathered letters of support from Cristina, Addison, April, Callie, and Arizona. He read Cristina's out loud and offered to keep going but the judge had heard enough. The panel voted to dismiss the entire case, meaning Meredith would get to keep her license. Alex congratulated Meredith with the rest of the staff who had come out to support her.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nShortly afterwards, Alex\uatraveled to Iowa to visit his mother.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref> He remained in Iowa for a while and worked out a deal for Richard to hire Maggie at Pac-North from there.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref><ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref>\n[[File:xAlexMeetsKids.png|thumb|Alex meets his kids.]]\nHe started to ignore Jo and Meredith's calls and texts, which prompted Jo to call\uaAlex's mother, who revealed that Alex had never been in Iowa. Soon afterwards, Meredith, Jo, Bailey, and Richard all received letters from Alex, who explained that he had reconciled with Izzie during Meredith's trial. He said that he felt like him and Izzie were \"frozen in time\" and that they felt unfinished. He also\uafound out that she gave birth to his kids with the embryos they froze years ago due to the cancer having nuked her eggs. Alex said that he was staying with Izzie and their two children (Alexis and Eli)\uain Kansas and wouldn't be coming back to Seattle, because he wanted\uato ensure his kids\uadidn't grow up like he did, without a father, along with the fact that he loved Izzie.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite the callous image he projects, Alex is particularly affected when he treats addicts and abused children because of his childhood background. He initially refused to install a central line for a Demerol addict because he did not want to feed his habit. He was also able to connect with a teenage boy whose abusive father hit his mother.<ref>[[Enough is Enough]], x</ref>\n\nHe hides his pain behind a mask of aggression and bad attitude. For a while, he pushed everyone away, but since going into peds, he's showed more of who he really is. After Cristina left, he acted as Meredith's person, which shows a different side of his personality, which shows him as sweet, caring, and compassionate.\n\n\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nIzzie realized that Alex was not as insensitive and cruel as he portrayed himself to be. She began a tentative friendship with him, to the shock of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[George O'Malley|George]]. Later, Meredith's opinion of Alex changed for the better when he offered to listen to her problems with her mother, [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]].\n\nWhen Alex found out that Izzie was an ex-lingerie model, he obtained a copy of her advertisement and proceeded to paste copies all over Seattle Grace. Although he succeeded in humiliating her, she turned things on him by stripping to her underwear in front of him and several other interns, reminding him that her modeling is the reason why she is debt-free while he is \ucsitting on two hundred grand of student loans\ud.\n\nAlex eventually asked Izzie out on a date. However on that very day, he found out from the Chief that he failed his medical board exams. This caused him to suffer from a crisis of confidence, leading him to treat her shabbily during their date. His confidence took another blow when he froze up during a makeshift emergency surgery in an elevator during a power outage, and George had to operate on the patient himself. Izzie, still furious from the horrendous date, refused to speak to him. Afterwards, in Joe's bar, he went up to her and kissed her, rekindling their budding relationship. However, their sex life hit a bump when Alex had difficulties performing. Meanwhile, his confidence in his medical skills further deteriorated after he accidentally administered a wrong dosage saline solution, paralyzing the patient. In a moment of vulnerability, he slept with Olivia and was caught in the act by Izzie, effectively ending their relationship.\n\nIzzie subsequently found out about it and blew up at her friends for helping Alex. She eventually forgave him but ruled out getting back together with him. Alex passed his re-test and became a full-fledged doctor. During the code black, the dire situation of a bomb scare caused Izzie to realize that she should act on her feelings. She accosted Alex and the two proceeded to have sex in a linen closet. They continued to sleep together several times over the course of the day.\n\nIzzie's patient, Denny Duquette, was re-admitted after he suffered a heart failure. Alex was jealous of Izzie's concern for Denny, and tried to get Denny to back off by telling him that he was with Izzie and there is a good chance that he would die from his failing heart anyway. She confronted him, and he told her that she cannot get involved with her patients. However, Izzie realized that she didn't have to settle for Alex. Offended when Alex referred to the still-living Denny as a \"corpse\", she dumped him saying, \"Just so we're clear, we're over. On your very best day, that 'corpse' is twice the man you will ever be. You're not good enough for me, Alex. You're not good enough for anyone.\"\n\nWhen Denny died from a stroke, Alex picked up a devastated Izzie and told her that the dead man was no longer Denny, the man she once loved. Alex realized that his feelings for Izzie had not diminished since she dumped him, and impulsively kissed her in the stairwell. Izzie had yet to get over Denny and told him she cannot commit in a relationship with him just yet, and he understood. However, Alex claimed his lack of interest in Izzie and has appeared to have gotten over her.\n\nHis feelings for Izzie eventually came back and when she gave him an ultimatum (to pick between the nice Alex and the jerk Alex) he chooses nice and they begin to go out again. He starts dating Izzie exclusively and after winning his solo-surgery he tells her he loves her.\n\nFollowing the revelation of her cancer, Alex ''[[Snooching|snooches]]'' in a cup as they harvest Izzie's eggs in case they ever want a child. When Izzie is discovered to have an inoperable tumor, Meredith and Derek gave their wedding to Alex and Izzie and the two marry.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Alex and Izzie get married.]]\n\nAfter the death of [[George O'Malley]], and the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]], Izzie was fired partly because Alex told Chief Webber she couldn't handle the pressure of working because she was still recovering. He meant to protect her but Izzie didn't think so and she left Seattle, leaving Alex with unpaid medical bills and no ideas of where she was.\n\nAlex remained worried for weeks trying to join her because she had to treat her cancer and she didn't show up to her round of chemo. When she finally got back, to get some help for an old teacher, they didn't manage to work their problems out and Izzie left once again.\n\nIzzie eventually sent Alex divorce papers, and while Alex signed them and had committed to Lexie, Alex still loved her. He called out for Izzie while he was delirious after getting shot. Alex, thinking Lexie was Izzie, expressed his glee that she returned and begged her to stay with him.\n\nOver time, he started dating other girls and his love for Izzie faded. A couple of years after Izzie's departure, Alex entered a committed relationship with Jo Wilson. When a patient showed up that reminded Alex of Izzie, Jo told him to call Izzie to find out how she was doing. He stated he didn't need to, as he had made up a new life for\ualzzie in his head, in which she was married and working as a surgeon. He preferred not to call her and instead held onto\uathat imagined life for her, in which she's always smiling as she's as happy with her husband as Alex is with Jo.\n\nBefore Meredith's medical trial, Alex called Izzie to see if she would help out, and during the conversation, he found out she had given birth to twins and he was the father as a result of the frozen embyos. He decided to go meet them, which reignited his romance with Izzie. They are currently raising their son and daughter together in Kansas.\n\n[[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia Harper]]\n[[File:xAlexandOlivia.png|thumb|xpx|Izzie finds Alex cheating on her with Olivia]]\nGeorge contracted [[Medical Glossary#S|syphilis]] from Alex through [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]]. It was revealed that Olivia was already dating Alex when George asked her out. Olivia subsequently broke up with Alex after realizing how much she liked George. Furious at the revelation that Alex was the cause of his syphilis, George punched Alex in the face. That night, [[Joe]], the owner of [[Emerald City Bar]] was admitted to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], and in discussions with Joe, it was revealed that Alex was a regular at Joe's bar every night and that he and Joe had become close friends. When George finds a way to pay for Joe's hospital bills, the animosity between George and Alex is dissolved after Alex gives George a hug.\n\nA mixer was held for the new interns, and it was at this mixer that he met and presumably hit it off with Nurse Olivia Harper, as he is shown leaving the event with an arm around her.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nAddison discovered Alex's better side and found herself attracted to him. To some degree, Alex was also attracted to Addison as they subsequently shared frequent meaningful looks. This culminated in an actual kiss in Joe's bar. Later, during the -day trial with [[Mark Sloan]], Addison sleeps with Alex, breaking the deal. However, he later told her that he only wants to work with her professionally, and is not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her. It was his work with her that led Alex to no longer pursue [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]] as a [[Specialties|specialty]] but spark an interest in [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]].\n\n[[Rebecca Pope]]\nDuring a ferry accident, Alex found a severely injured pregnant woman crushed under a pylon. He rescued her from the debris and encouraged her to stay alive. The pregnant Jane Doe subsequently became hysterical after realizing she could not remember anything, and turned to Alex for support, thinking that he was her husband. Alex showed much concern for her and constantly checked on her progress, bonding with her in the process. He also helped her pick out a new face for reconstruction, as well as a new name \"Ava\". As Alex spent more time with Ava, he became increasingly attached to her, spending most of his time checking on her progress and doing research. This led Addison to accuse him of being too emotionally involved with a patient, but he countered saying that he was just being prepared. In the heat of the argument, Addison kissed him and pushed him into an on-call room, where the two had sex. However, Alex rebuffed Addison's subsequent advances, after learning she wanted a committed man to have kids with, something which he was not ready for.\n\nAfter Addison left, Ava returned\uaa couple times and they slept together. The last time she came, she told him that she was pregnant, which caused\uaAlex to ask whether she was keeping it. After that, he became more sensitive and had\uaher move in. After a couple days, Izzie confronted\uaAlex and rold him that Ava was not really pregnant and never was. Alex refused\uato believe it and so did Ava. Izzie showed\uahim the charts though, and he couldn't dispute that, so he told Ava, and she thought she had a miscarriage even though he told her there was no baby. She couldn't take care of herself and so he did everything for her, insisting that she was\uafine. Finally, she cut herself and Izzie admitted\uaher and forced\uaher to get a psych consult. Alex called\uaher husband, who told him that he left Ava and went with the child. He also said\uathat she'd already been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. She was taken to a psychiatric ward and Alex was forced to move on.\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nAlex decided to not wait for her and he slept with [[Lexie Grey]] just before Izzie came back home. She tried to convince him that they could start over but he had moved on and he decided to break up with Izzie. So Izzie left Seattle for apparently the last time, telling she couldn't stand it.\n\nLater, she sent the divorce paper to Alex, with her name signed on it. Alex then signed his name, kissed Lexie and they walked out of the hospital, hand-in-hand.\n\nAlex was shot in the hospital by a grieving deceased patient's husband, but survived with the help of Lexie and Mark. While undergoing treatment, he mistook Lexie for Izzie. He apologized to her and continued by telling her \"[she] came back\" and tearfully begging her never to leave him again; Lexie, declining to correct him, assured him that she never would. Following the shooting, Lexie had a mental breakdown in front of Alex. Mark asked Alex to help her but he refused and walks away. He returned to being very promiscuous and refused to have the bullet in his chest removed, saying that it was his \"war wound.\" After insulting Lexie, she cut him down to size, stating that he was not \"badass\" for living because she was the reason that he survived and that while he was dying, he cried out for the wife who left him, that is, Izzie. Alex is left speechless.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nAlex and Callie slept together after a big surgery involving reconstruction of a man's legs was successful. No one knew at the time, but the relationship was later revealed when Callie gave her speech on Lecture Day.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n\n[[Lucy Fields]]\nAlex had a brief romantic relationship with the attending OB/GYN Lucy Fields. At first, Lucy strongly disliked Alex after he called her patient a turnip, but after discovering they shared an equal enthusiasm for college basketball, she liked him slightly more. Eventually, they began a romantic and sexual relationship.\ua[[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]]\uaoffered Alex the proposal to go to Africa to tend to and check up on the patients who visited and received medical attention at Seattle Grace. Lucy was disappointed because as Alex was considering that opportunity, he didn't even think about Lucy. She shook it off by saying it didn't matter what she thought. Arizona approached Alex and asks him if he wasn't taking the job because of Lucy, as she didn't want him to do the same thing she did and run back to Lucy once in Africa. Alex told Lucy he was not taking the job in Africa because she was \"a factor.\" She told him to stop and said he was right when he said career comes first. She told him she took the job -- not at Baylor, but Alex's proposed job in Africa. She assured him it wasn't personal. Not long after that, she walked into Joe's and said to Alex, \"tell me not to go to Africa.\" He told her to go to hell.\n\nInterns\nWhile still planning to go to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], Alex was known as a \"player\" amongst the new interns and also as the attending who sleeps around with all of the interns because he didn't plan to stay at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nOne of the interns, [[Jo Wilson]], started up a close friendship with Alex. They bonded at Bailey's wedding as they talked about their hard upbringings. They saw\uaeach other as just friends. However, after some time, Alex began\uato see Jo in a different way. This was seen when he got\uajealous of her going on a date with an OB/GYN resident, [[Jason Myers]]. Jo and Alex began to separate as she and Jason became a couple and Alex tried to avoid his feelings for her. After Alex told Jason about Jo's past, Jo yelled at Alex and told him that she shouldn't have trusted him. Alex admitted his love for her to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] not long after that.\n\nThe two avoided each other almost entirely after their fight. One night, Alex witnesses Jo and Jason fighting. Not long after, she shows up at his doorstep and he begins to argue with her for being unavoidable. She turns her face toward him and it's clear that she has been hit by Jason. Alex takes her up to his bed and tucks her in.\n\n[[Perfect Storm|During the superstorm]], he finally admitted\uato Jo that he loves her and the couple shared\uaa kiss.\n\nAfter that, they began dating. They hit a bit of a rocky patch when Alex's dad came into the hospital from a car crash related to drugs. Alex asked Jo to do a paternity test, and he said he didn't want to know at the same time she said, \"he's your father.\" Alex then proceeded to stalk his father at bars where he was performing. When Alex didn't come home for  nights in a row,\uaJo got worried. He then told her what was happening and they worked it out.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Alex proposes marriage to Jo.]]\n\nAfter his dad returned to the hospital trying to get clean, Alex said goodbye for a final time. At [[April Kepner|April's]] wedding, Alex proposed to Jo, without actually saying that he wanted to marry her. When Jo realized that he proposed to her, she declined. However, they stayed together. Although Jo didn't accept Alex's proposal, he still knows that he will eventually marry her.\n\nAlex proposed to Jo for the second time two years later. At the same time, Jo was trying to dump Alex for spending too much time with Meredith. Alex asked Meredith to keep Jo's ring until the day he would propose to her. Jo unfortunately didn't know that Meredith was only trying to pass Jo's ring to Alex without her seeing.\n\nAfter Jo not answering the proposal, they broke up and after spending some time apart, they got back together. The unanswered proposal caused some strain on their relationship. She eventually told Alex that she didn't want the ring yet, but she also didn't want it gone and that he should keep in in the drawer.\n\nAfter a few months, Alex asked Jo if they would ever get married. He said it didn't have to be today or tomorrow but he wanted to know that it would happen. She said she couldn't, but Alex was adamant that she could. She said no.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\ua\n\nThey fought. She said she loved him and that they should make a baby, but he wanted to get married. He wanted to know why and as she went to tell him, he cut her off and stormed out. Later, she told Andrew the reason why she couldn't marry Alex was because she was already married to an abusive man and feared if she filed for divorce, he would find her. Alex didn't know this because she worried about him going after her abusive ex. Alex walked into the loft and found Jo giggling while half-naked and DeLuca on top of her in bed. He jumped to the wrong conclusion and began to punch him.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Alex told Jo that he'd found her husband and gone to see him, Jo locked the door and started kissing him, surprised that he'd seen her husband without killing him, which proved to her that Alex wasn't a violent guy.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\uaThey got back together and eventually got engaged. Their wedding ceremony was held on a ferryboat and was officiated by Meredith.\n\nAfter Jo visited her birth mom and entered a depressive episode, Alex stayed by her side and helped her recover. Jo felt bad for being another one of his crazy women and offered him an out, but instead, later on,\uaAlex proposed to her again. Jo accepted.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\uaThe two got married on Halloween.\n\nAfter Meredith's trial, Alex supposedly went to Iowa to tend to his sick mother, but after failing to return Jo's calls, she found out from his mom that he was never in Iowa. A few days later, Jo received a letter from him, saying he was living in Kansas with Izzie and their two kids. He explained that it felt like him and Izzie were \"frozen in time\" which caused him to want to stay with her.\uaHe said he loved Jo, and he meant it when he wanted to marry her, and also told her she would find a better man than him. He also sent her divorce papers.\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nInitially, Meredith disliked Alex. Meredith thought that Alex was a bad person, who just had sex with everyone in the hospital. He was not nice to anyone, especially fellow intern and Meredith's close friend\ua[[George O'Malley]]. Eventually,\ua[[Izzie Stevens]]\uabefriended Alex and Meredith accepted him as well. They maintained a close friendship throughout the years and Alex even made Meredith his best man at his wedding to Izzie.\ua\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Meredith and Alex talk about Derek]]\nWhen Izzie left the hospital after being fired, Meredith became a source of support for Alex. They maintained a very close friendship until Alex informed\ua[[Owen Hunt]]\uain a drunken state\uaof Meredith's tampering with the Alzheimer's trial. Meredith became furious with Alex, especially since this led to Zola being taken away. Alex worked hard for Meredith's forgiveness, however, and even went to the judge responsible for Zola's adoption case. He apologized to Meredith lots of times but she refused to forgive him at first. When [[Cristina Yang]] got Alex to get up and help Meredith to keep Zola, after yelling at him, he replied with, \"I don't have anyone! You guys are all I have! You're supposed to have my back! You have to forgive me!\" With his help, Meredith and\ua[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]\uagot Zola back. Since this, Meredith and Alex have recovered and maintain a close friendship. Alex also bought\ua[[Meredith's House|Meredith's house]]\uafrom her after he chose to remain in [[Seattle]].\n\nMeredith even went so far to help Alex come up with a lie to tell the police since his hand was bruised from attacking Andrew DeLuca, and she helped him calm down.\n\nThere has never been any sexual attraction between Alex and Meredith. When they lived together, Meredith would often sit in the bathroom while Alex showered and vent to him as they have a brother/sister relationship.\n\nWith Cristina's departure, Alex has become Meredith's new \"person\".\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nCristina and Alex have a love-hate relationship as they often make fun of each other but no matter what Alex, Cristina, and Meredith are there for each other. They are from the same intern class, so naturally, they are close as they have spent so many years together.\n\nWhen Alex buys Meredith's house, Cristina moves in.\n\nCristina told Alex on her last day in Seattle that she was surprised by how good he became as a surgeon. This was one of the very few compliments Alex has ever gotten from her. She also told Meredith that Alex needs to be mocked at least once a day or he'll be insufferable.\n\nAfter Cristina left Seattle for Z\ufcrich, Alex found an envelope in his bed that informed him that Cristina had left her shares of the hospital to him.\n\n[[Morgan Peterson]]\nMorgan was a surgical intern at Seattle Grace Mercy West. She was Alex's intern and was helping him study to pass his boards when she passed out. She had heart complications and needed an emergency c-section. She had a boyfriend, Chris, who worked at the [[Cleveland Clinic]]. The baby was born at  weeks, and Chris left a little while after the baby was born because he thought the baby was going to die and that it was pointless because the pregnancy was accidental anyway. Morgan decided to call the baby Tommy after her father. Alex was very attached to Tommy. Alex and Morgan got close, but Arizona scared Alex off of Morgan by telling Alex that Morgan was into him. Alex avoided her and Tommy for weeks. Alex tried to get back into the case later. He almost missed his flight to San Francisco to take his boards because he was taking care of Tommy. He then flew back to Seattle the night before his boards to take care of Tommy and helped Morgan when Tommy died.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nEver since the start of their internship, Alex has disliked George. On their first day as interns, George was given the name  (when he froze in his first surgery) by Alex and it was the start of their mutual dislike for each other. Later on, George learned that he had contracted syphilis from his girlfriend Olivia. George was given the name \"Syph-boy\" by Cristina but soon learned that Alex was the person that gave syphilis to Olivia, which lead to Alex being punched by George. And on a different occasion, when Alex told George that Callie had slept with Mark Sloan, George went into denial and got into another fight with him.\n\nAlex repeatedly and frequently pointed out George's flaws - calling him weak and pathetic more than once - but Alex later revealed that he actually respected George and that if he were still alive then he would have beaten all the other residents at each milestone (st solo surgery, chief resident, etc.). Professionally, George had beaten Alex during important situations, even though Alex was better at poaching surgeries, George would have been better at dealing with emergency cases while Alex would just have frozen (e.g. heart in the elevator). Later, when George's mother returned, which brings back memories of George, Alex revealed to Cristina and Meredith that he didn't like to think of George because it reminded him of Izzie (his ex-wife) which brought pain.\n\nOver the years, Alex's views on George softened. When Meredith, Callie, and Alex were discussing all of the different doctors that lived in Meredith's house, George was brought up and Alex made a somber toast in his honor, showing that he truly did see him as a friend.\n\n\nDuring his intern year, Alex notably had a reputation for getting on the bad side of his attendings and other staff. and laissez-faire in dealing with patients, earning him the reprimand of Chief Webber. Dr. Shepherd once kicked him out of the O.R. for asking if their critically ill patient who had to be taken back for surgery could count as his second surgery and Dr. Hunt called him out several times for his lack of bedside manners.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nArizona is Alex's mentor and the two have maintained a close relationship because of that. Arizona is one of the only people who fully believes in Alex's surgical abilities. When Alex had decided to take the fellowship at Johns Hopkins, Arizona was hurt and upset. As a result of this, she decided to take Alex's spot on the [[Flight|plane]] that eventually crashed. As a result of this plane crash, Arizona lost her leg. At first, Alex worried that she blamed him as he was supposed to be in her spot. But this was not the case and Arizona and Alex continued to work well together.\n\nArizona also supported his decision to work for [[Oliver Lebackes]] and helped him after he ran into problems there.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhen acclaimed plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan took up a position at Seattle Grace, Alex leapt at the chance to pursue his interest in plastics. He wanted Addison to release him from her service, and she did. It becomes clear that Mark is a poor teacher, only delegating menial tasks to Alex. Alex gradually developed distaste for plastics after serving as Mark's intern, and found himself drawn back to Addison's surgeries.\n\nDuring the shooting, Mark, along with the help of Lexie, saved Alex's life after he was shot.\n\n\nAlex Karev is a former wrestler at [[University of Iowa]], and attended college on a wrestling scholarship.\n\nAlex prides himself on his honesty, which often lacks tact and can verge on being crude, brutal, and insensitive. This contributes to his poor bedside manner. However, Alex does have a moral code and is the only doctor who tells the truth to patients who make bad decisions about their health, at the risk of offending patients and getting kicked out of surgical cases.\n\nAlex is also the first intern to decide on his specialty \u [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]]. While it seemed at first that he chose that specialty due to \"frat-boy\" superficiality, the real reason was that plastic surgery patients \ucsign up for the pain they get\ud. He has unwittingly been drawn to [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|obstetrics and gynecology]] and [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]], after having several bad experiences in plastics, under Mark Sloan. Alex seems to have some talent in OB/GYN after serving as Addison's intern for a while.\n\nAlex Karev secured a position in the surgical residency program at Seattle Grace after graduating from medical school. Although first he was an intern of Jeremy, Alex was reassigned to a new resident [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]], to the disdain of the other interns under her. His frequent sexist remarks and overt come-ons made him even more disliked by the interns, who proceeded to dub him \ucevil spawn\ud. He became even more hated when he hijacked an open-heart surgery that rightfully belonged to the other interns. After which, he proceeded to taunt a furious Meredith, who attacked him in retaliation, calling him a \ucfrat boy bitch\ud.\n\nAlex confided in Meredith about his failed medical boards and she decided to help him study, roping in Cristina and George to help as well.\n\nAlex's streak of brutal honesty caused Addison to be on the receiving end of legal action, when he persuaded a patient's husband to sue the hospital for Addison's \ucmistake\ud in \ucBlue's for Sister Someone\ud. Furious, she informs a stunned Alex that he would be placed permanently under her service. Despite his lack of interest in obstetrics and gynecology, he has exhibited some flair for it as he managed to deliver a premature baby by himself.\n\nWhen acclaimed [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgeon]] Dr. [[Mark Sloan]] took up a position at Seattle Grace, Alex leapt at the chance to pursue his interest in plastics. He wanted Addison to release him from her service, and she did, but not before telling him that he would miss her. It becomes clear that Mark is a poor teacher, only delegating menial tasks to Alex. Alex gradually developed distaste for plastics after serving as Mark's intern, and found himself drawn back to Addison's surgeries. Addison left Seattle Grace and Alex found himself without any preferences for any specialty.\n\nWhen Rebecca Pope returned to Seattle Grace and revealed she was pregnant, Alex took up some shifts at the [[Emerald City Bar]].\n\nWhen Cristina was chosen to pick the first resident to perform a solo surgery, she chose Alex who performed a below the knee amputation.\n\nIt was during Alex's third year of residency that he heavily considered [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]] as a specialty. Given his time as Addison's intern, and with Bailey's recommendation, [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Pediatric Surgery [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]] mentored Alex for the remainder of his residency; he officially declared his specialty during his fifth year, paving the way for his [[Fellow|fellowships]] after his residency.\n\nAlex was [[Owen Hunt|Owen's]] original choice for chief resident but after he sold out\ua[[Meredith Grey|Meredith]]\uawhen she tampered with the Alzheimer's trial,\ua[[Owen Hunt|Owen]]\uachose\ua[[April Kepner]]\uainstead.\n\nAlex passed his [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|oral boards]] and is a [[Board Certification|board certified surgeon]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|general surgery]] and completed a pediatric surgical fellowship at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] after turning down a fellowship at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]]. He then joined [[Lebackes Pediatric Surgery Clinic]], a private practice, as a new partner under practice director [[Oliver Lebackes|Dr. Oliver Lebackes]].\n\nWhen Cristina transferred her hospital shares to Alex, he considered sitting on the board of [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Unfortunately, the board unanimously voted for Bailey to take Cristina's seat, but hired Alex as an attending pediatric surgeon, especially as [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] needed to focus on her new fellowship in [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]].\n\nSometime after Robbins was promoted to the head of fetal surgery and Bailey was promoted to [[Chief of Surgery]], Alex was promoted to Robbins' old position as department head of pediatric surgery. Alex was then temporarily demoted to staff physician at the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]] when he was suspended. When his charges were dropped sometime later, Bailey reinstated Alex back to the surgical staff as the pediatric surgery head.\n\nAfter being fired by Bailey for his part in Meredith's insurance fraud, Alex was hired as Chief of Staff and Chief of Surgery at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]].\n\n\n*Alex Karev was not in the original pilot script. He wasn't added until after the pilot was shot. Therefore, scenes with him were either reshoots or digitally altered to include him.\n*His uncle is a rodeo cowboy.<ref>[[Superstition]], x</ref>\n*When discussing medical proxies, Alex told Cristina she could be his proxy.

He is married to [[Miranda Bailey]]. Ben was previously a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and was initially an [[Attending|attending]] [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] prior to changing his career to surgery, and later to a firefighter.\n\n\n\nBen grew into an adrenalin-chasing teenager. One day, he went on a joyride with his friends Michael and Danny with the latter's father's car. While out driving, Michael asked Danny to let him ride for once. Danny was hesitant but Ben dared him to allow it, which lead to Danny giving in. While Michael was speeding, Danny stood up in the backseat to experience that feeling that the other two had described as amazing. Out of nowhere, a deer crossed the road right in front of them. The car swerved and slammed into a tree. Danny was thrown out and Ben and Michael found him unconscious with an open skull fracture. Michael drove him to the hospital while Ben tried to get him to wake up in the backseat. Danny ended up in a persistent vegetative state. Guilt-ridden, Ben sat by Danny's beside for days until Danny's mother told him that she hoped that this accident had made him start thinking about his actions and that he would never do anything to make his mother go through what she was going through now.<ref>[[Indoor Fireworks]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAs a result, Ben changed himself to get rid of his adrenalin-chasing habits and learned to like crosswords. He got into med school and ended up choosing anesthesiology so he would be able to wake people up, unlike Danny.\n\n\nBen initially was an attending anesthesiologist at [[Mercy West Medical Center]] and transferred to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital when the two hospitals merged. During a surgery performed by [[Meredith Grey]] and [[Miranda Bailey]], [[Leslie Wilson|the patient]] woke up on the table and Bailey yelled at Ben to put her back under. Bailey put all the blame on Ben and said that at Seattle Grace, they could always trust the \"gas man\" to keep the patients under while the surgeons did the real work. He set out to investigate and discovered she had a condition that caused her to metabolize the anesthetics more rapidly than normal, which is why she woke up. He found Bailey and asked for an apology, though he let that go when he noticed how rattled Bailey was about the patient refusing to let Bailey touch her again. Leslie had be operated on again as she had a rebleed so Meredith took over from Bailey. During the surgery, Ben knew how to properly keep her under. He brought up Bailey's speech about anesthesiologists being lazy and she told him that she yells at people when she gets scared, which was the closest he'd get to an apology.<ref>[[State of Love and Trust]], x</ref>\n\nBen became interested in Bailey and asked her out to dinner on Valentine's Day to make up for the fact that one of their surgeries was pushed because of a massive trauma. She told him she was too busy with surgery. Callie and Arizona got involved playing Cupid and they got Ben re-assigned to Bailey's new surgery. Arizona joined them in the OR and steered the conversation towards dating. She told Ben that Bailey had almost become a pediatric surgeon until she changed her mind, hinting that Bailey could be persuaded to change her mind about the date. After surgery, Ben congratulated Bailey on her saving the patient. She then told him she didn't want to talk to him because she liked him and his being around her made her go stupid. However, she did agree to go out to dinner with him the next day.<ref>[[Valentine's Day Massacre]], x</ref> The first date went well. A few days later, he found her preparing for a speech at lecture day. He complimented her and although she told him to go away, she enjoyed being flattered.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, he told her she was having dinner with him that night for their third date. She had a yoga class scheduled but he convinced her to let that go. Callie got into her head about the third date meaning sex, so while at his apartment, she started lecturing him about her not doing things on a timeline. He interrupted her lecture and said lecturing wouldn't work on him because he wasn't too scared to interrupt her like the people at work. He told her they would have a nice dinner with conversation and swore that he didn't expect sex, because he, too, found the third date early for that. She confessed she hadn't had sex with anyone other than her ex-husband. He didn't mind and appreciated that she, like him, didn't get into that too fast. She asked him what he thought was the right time. While he thought they would know when they were there, he suspected somewhere between date  and . She cautiously asked if he was afraid they'd end up just being friends. He was confident that wouldn't happen since none of them started this looking for friends. He then kissed her and they had a nice evening.<ref>[[Push]], x</ref>\n\nThey continued to date for months. While back at his apartment, she started lecturing him about what he couldn't do to her at the hospital in order to keep her personal and professional lives separated. He got undressed in front of her and told her she could either lecture him or let him take her to his bedroom. She chose the second option. The next day, Mark and Derek found out because of the two of them were humming the same song on the elevator. Bailey later caught Ben flirting with a nurse and spent the day being cold towards him. He found her at the end of the day and told her that he flirted with Liz so she would do him little favors, which made his job more fun. Also, he brought his lazy flirting for Liz so he could save the good flirting for Bailey. She told him she was going through a tough divorce and didn't have time for games. He assured her he was in it for real and they left the hospital holding hands.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the shooting at the hospital, Ben was out playing golf with his phone turned off, so he didn't find out about the shooting until after it was over. Bailey was heavily traumatized from her experience and packed up to go visit her mother with her son. Ben came by her house and found her getting into a cab. She ignored his question about when she'd be back and left. She returned after a month. He tried to talk to her after her work day and she told him that while he was a perfect man, she was too busy holding herself together with tape and glue to be with him now. Since he missed the shooting, he couldn't understand what she was going through and that made it too much for her to be with him. He understood and told her to take care of herself.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\n\nFor the rest of the year, Ben stayed out of Bailey's way by bringing a guy named Pierre coffees so he wouldn't assign Ben to Bailey's surgeries.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\nAt one point, [[Eli Lloyd|nurse Eli]] and Ben got into a conflict because Eli yelled at one of Ben's residents for messing up a routine epidural. Derek broke up the fight and told Ben that they should fight over Bailey on his own time but Ben didn't even know Bailey was dating Eli. In surgery, Ben told Derek the news had upset him so much that he couldn't concentrate during a meeting. Derek then invited him to take out his anger by helping him build the deck at his house. While doing that, Ben vented his anger to Owen about Bailey blowing him off over not being ready for a relationship only to start dating Eli months later. The next day, Ben saw Eli and Bailey together with Tuck. He and Derek agreed they looked happy so Ben let them be. He came out to Derek's deck to blow off steam again in the evening.<ref>[[What is It About Men]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Ben decided he wouldn't avoid her anymore and they soon ended up on the same surgery again. He approached her and asked her if that would be a problem. She said no. He was happy to hear that because he was done paying off Pierre with lattes if she was now being held together by a male nurse rather than tape and glue. After the surgery, Ben couldn't fully hide his anger about her sleeping with Eli after she basically told him to wait for her. Bailey said a relationship like they had was too much for her to handle and added that what she was doing with Eli was nothing like what they had. Ben asked her what she was doing with Eli then but she ignored the question and told him to take it up with Pierre if he had a problem working with her. After work, Ben shortly greeted Bailey as he walked past her on his way to his car. She came after him and told him he would soon hear things about her breaking up with Eli. She wanted to clarify that that didn't have anything to do with him. He saw right through her lie and smiled as he said he'd see her tomorrow.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, Ben ended up in Bailey's OR again. He had heard about [[Henry Burton]] dying and brought that up, but she snapped that she'd rather talk about her living patients. Ben diagnosed malignant hyperthermia when Bailey's patient on the table started to deteriorate. He acted quickly to get the patient to cool down, which saved the kid's life. Bailey and Ben waited for the patient's temperature to decline sufficiently for the procedure to continue, during which Bailey complimented Ben's quick diagnosis. Afterward, they ended up in an empty cafeteria and she apologized for being rude to him when he mentioned Henry earlier. He was already used to her lashing out, which is what she does when bad things happen to her. It meant she needed space, which is why he sat down at a different table. She said she didn't just lose a patient, she lost a friend. He was sorry to hear that. She then told him she wouldn't mind if he didn't give her quite so much space, after which he moved to her table and held her hand while he finished his crossword puzzle.<ref>[[Suddenly]], x</ref>\n\nThey started their relationship again and after two weeks, Ben asked her to move in. She didn't give him an answer so he maneuvered himself onto her surgery so he could talk to her about it. Bailey recruited Meredith to flood her with questions so she could teach instead of talking to Ben about moving in. Ben saw through that trick and steered the conversation towards living together, citing Meredith and Derek as an example. Bailey pointed out that Meredith's tampering with Derek's trial nearly destroyed both her professional and personal life, which got her to admit that she wanted to keep her personal and professional lives separated. Ben commented he would just like for her to be the first thing he would see in the morning and then let it go. When Meredith left for lunch, Bailey told Ben that she didn't want to complicate what they had by rushing it. He told her his life was happening right now and that he wanted to share all of it with her, every day. If she didn't want that, he thought they weren't right for each other. She still didn't agree, which he took as his answer. After the break, Ben again pointed out Meredith had a perfect balance between her professional and personal life. The patient made it through and Ben joked they could go have a drink to celebrate if only she were to let joy into her life. She snapped and said she wanted to focus at work in order not to make mistakes. After the surgery, Bailey told Ben her whole life fell apart when she got divorced and she had worked hard to get back on her feet. She was scared of her relationship with him blowing up again, which would cause her to get knocked off her feet again. He said they could be scared together in the same house and take it one step at a time, starting with her bringing her toothbrush over. She reminded him she had a son. Ben liked him and assured her that he wanted the whole package. She then agreed to take it one step at a time.<ref>[[This Magic Moment]], x</ref>\n\nBen set up an elegant dinner for her them on Valentine's Day. That morning, he checked if they were still on for tonight as she had a habit of cancelling for a surgery. She told him she had rearranged her entire schedule to be out on time and even brought heels in the back of her car. However, she got drawn in when her patient was found to have a second tumor in a yet-to-be-discovered location. She had Ben push the reservation to  PM but by the time she made it out of the OR, it was :. She ran into Ben, not having realized the time until then, and apologized for ruining their Valentine's Day. She started a lecture about how he couldn't fault her for saving lives. She then noticed he was in a suit. He told her Valentine's Day wasn't over yet and took her to the cafeteria, where he had set up a romantic dinner for the two of them. He had been planning it for weeks as he knew they would never make their reservation. He told her he was very good at romance. She agreed and they shared a toast.<ref>[[All You Need is Love]], x</ref>\n\nAfter working on opposite schedules for weeks, Ben and Bailey agreed to watch a game together, though Ben hadn't planned on actually watching the game since Tuck was at his father's. However, Bailey had to cancel because Callie and Arizona asked her to come to girls' night to cheer up Teddy after Henry's death and her falling out with Owen. Bailey initially wanted to ditch the women for her evening with Ben but she showed up anyway.<ref>[[Support System]], x</ref>\n\n\nBen got offered an internship at UCLA. He accepted and moved to Los Angeles to start. At the beginning, Ben and Bailey weren't sure it would work out, but both Miranda and Ben kept their relationship alive only seeing each other every now and then.\n\n\nBen quit his job at UCLA because he felt he never saw Miranda or his stepson, so he came back and surprised her, saying he quit his job. Miranda was not so thrilled right away because she did approve of him giving up surgery, but, it was later revealed that he did not want to give up surgery and he became a surgical resident again at GSM.\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of whom had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Ben opened up a man in the psych ward and operated on a pregnant lady without proper consent and surgical equipment, he was put on probation for  months. He attained privileges as an attending anesthesiologist during his probation.\n\n\nBen was one of the many doctors who helped evacuate patients amidst the hospital explosion. When asked about [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie Edwards']] whereabouts, he recalled seeing her before the explosion and led a team of firefighters inside the actively burning hospital to find her. After searching, he found a trace of blood on the stairs leading up to the roof of the hospital, where they were able to locate and save Stephanie and [[Erin Miller|Erin]].\n\n\nBen claimed he was happy with surgery but wanted something more. Later he admited to Miranda that he had been accepted into the Seattle Fire Academy. Miranda was not amused but later supported Ben in his decision.\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. Having extinguished the fire, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean and Ben responded to an Aid call at The Langham. They found [[JJ Lau|JJ]] on her floor after she fell off a ladder. Her smoke alarm was still going off, so Dean broke through the ceiling and released smoke into the apartment. He picked up JJ and carried her out of her apartment.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop. They later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital. At the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she had developed a fear of fire since the tanker incident. The team decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. After the fire burned itself out, Ben was put on cleanup.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over. Afterward, Ben was interviewed by Ripley as part of the process to decide who would be captain of Station . He asked Ben about the situation with Peter and the party bus crash. At the end of Ben's explanation, Ripley applauded Ben's honesty in the situation.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. Outside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount. The trapped were freed when they used the water heater to cause an explosion and compromise the door just enough to give them access.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen came into work one day and learned that he'd reached an important milestone. He'd walked into and out of fifty fires. He was given a key to the aid car and permission to drive it. Station  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. Ben and Travis treated patients with minor burns at triage and sent them out. When Jack and Dean found combustibles on a floor above the fire, a rapid evacuation was started. In order to release the civilians from the top floor, Ripley sent Ben and Travis to clear the black smoke out of the stairwells so they could walk down. They did so, but when the fire jumped floors and broke out the window, Travis became impaled on a shard of glass. With the radios not working, Ben dragged Travis down the stairs. On the stairs, they ran into Molly, who had been trampled by a panicked mob. Her lung was collapsed. Travis told Ben to take Molly downstairs and save the life he could save. Then there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen dragged Molly down the stairs toward the bottom. She suddenly started struggling to breathe even more than before, so Ben put her down. He then used the needle from the EpiPen in her first aid kit to re-inflate her lung. He then started to carry her down the stairs to keep the needle stable. Once she was outside, he put her on a gurney and took her to the aid car and took her to the hospital. He handed her off to Bailey, who took her into surgery. Travis arrived with Vic and Dean moments later, but when he asked about Travis, Vic angrily brushed him off. They all went to the waiting room to see how Molly and Travis would come out. When [[Grant (Station )|Grant]] arrived, he was also upset to learn that Ben had left Travis alone. They continued to wait and were told that Travis's repair would be extremely difficult. Ben also learned that Molly didn't survive her surgery, which upset him. In the end, Travis pulled through and spent the next several weeks recovering.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away by the water. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis, Dean, and Ben responded to the call when [[Hannah Sherwood]] got her hand caught in her garbage disposal. She'd reached down there when her wedding ring had fallen in and got her hand caught. She turned it off quickly, but then decided to wait for help instead of trying to pull her hand out. Travis said he'd disconnect it and then take it apart to release her hand. While they were work, Hannah noticed that her daughter had gotten a tattoo and asked one of them to check it out to see if it was infected. Dean did and put antibiotic ointment on it. Travis was finally able to free Hannah's hand and they told her to follow up with the hospital in a few days.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor. At the party, Ben told Dean he was happy to be home with his wife, and prepared to make changes to keep her happy, which may include quitting firefighting.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter months of rehab, Sullivan was finally ready to go back to work. He met with Pruitt, who had acted as interim captain, and received reports from Pruitt. Pruitt criticized him for missing Jack's PTSD and not seeing that regular drop-ins weren't coming in anymore. This inspired Sullivan to take Ben and Jack for a wellness check on a drop-in Pruitt specifically mentioned. They went to his house and did an exam. He revealed that Sullivan was the reason he stopped checking in. His car was busted, leaving him unable to pick up his medications. Ben then heard regurgitation in his heart. He didn't want to go to the hospital, but he collapsed trying to fight them off. Sullivan distracted him with a game of chess as they worked to get him stable while they waited for an aid car. He stabilized, then checkmated Sullivan. After they sent him to the hospital, they remembered that he mentioned his car wasn't working, so they went to his garage and fixed it.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen, Dean, and Travis had planned to work together to repaint Travis's place. As they prepared to leave, Sullivan talked his way into an invitation to join them. With Sullivan there, they painted in virtual silence. When Sullivan started dancing while painting, they were disturbed, but he explained that when a month ago, you couldn't move your legs, you dance when a song comes on that makes you want to dance. The rest of them started to dance as well.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. While they worked on her, Andy took Ellie to the conference room to talk to her and keep her calm. As her mom was ready to be moved, she said she didn't want to go to the hospital with her because she felt she was always messing things up. Shortly afterward, she collapsed from low blood sugar. She was given glucose and quickly woke up, but still worried about her mom having another seizure and her not being able to help. Andy then sent Ellie to the hospital to be with her mom, while they dealt with the damage to the station caused by the crash and subsequent explosion.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen Ripley passed out on a sidewalk and was taken to the hospital, Sullivan, Ben, and Andy came to the hospital to check on his condition. Andy and Ben were surprised to learn that he'd been buying flowers for Vic when he passed out. After being banished from his room, they waited in the hospital waiting area. They were shocked when his lab results came back, showing his condition was much worse than previously believed and he had fled the hospital in search of Vic.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter reuniting with Bailey, he decided he wanted to try something that would be less stressful for her and thought it might be time to move on from being a firefighter.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref> When Pruitt heard about this, he suggested that Ben try out for Medic One, an elite paramedic team.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> Despite his medical training, Ben wasn't sure he'd be good enough to make it.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nBailey unexpectedly became pregnant, but then sadly lost the pregnancy.\n\n\nAfter months of quarantining mostly separately, Ben and Bailey finally got some alone time when [[Rosalind Warren|Roz]] took the boys out for a hike. They had sex and while cuddling afterward, Bailey felt a mass in Ben's testicle. She demanded they go see a urologist right away. Since he refused to go to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], she did some research and got them an appointment at [[Clark Kabir|Kabir Urology Clinic]]. Based on the labs and ultrasound, Dr. Kabir strongly suspected a mixed germ cell tumor, for which Ben's job put him at an increased risk. He proposed to perform an orchiectomy and analyze the tissue afterward rather than a biopsy, since that type of tumor could quickly metastasize. On the drive home, Ben revealed he wasn't sure what to tell the boys. Bailey was firm about telling them the truth, which would show them it is okay to be vulnerable. Ben confessed he wasn't ready to have the surgery yet, but Bailey reminded him of the mortality rate for Black men with cancer and said she couldn't handle any more loss after the year she had had. After his conversation with the boys, Joey joined him in the kitchen and asked him questions about the procedure. Ben picked up on his interest in medicine and said he and Bailey would help cover the cost if he were to decide to go to med school, much to Joey's delight.<ref>[[I Guess I'm Floating]], x (S)</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, news about George Floyd's death spread across the country. Ben found out on his phone at the station and joined his crew-mates in the lounge as they watched the news report on television in horror. Maya brought in [[Diane Lewis]] to grief counsel her team. Ben was the first to seek her out and opened up his fears as a Black man in America and the struggles of raising Black sons in the current political climate.\n\nBen along with Dean, Vic, and Robert attended the annual Black Firefighters Coalition where [[Battalion Chief Gregory]] gave a speech about working his way up to create lasting equity from within. Ben and Vic criticized him for being all talk and no actual change. Later, Ben witnessed how Dean jumped into the ocean after Gregory, who had fallen over the railing after clutching his chest. Ben grabbed a life vest and throw ring and jumped after Dean. Together, they tried to perform CPR on Gregory to no avail while the boat sailed off into the distance. Ben concluded there was nothing they could do for Gregory anymore. They realized they had drifted about a mile from where they had gone overboard, meaning they would be hard to find, and neither of them had a working phone on them to contact people on the boat. Dean refused to let go of Gregory's corpse and they floated around aimlessly waiting for help to arrive. As they drifted around, Ben urged Dean to fight so he could push through with his lawsuit and make the world a better place for Pru. He then revealed his cancer diagnosis and Dean found he was hesitant to have the surgery, which he called Ben out for. Dean freaked about dying again, which would mean that he would die without telling the one woman he wanted to be Pru's mother how he felt about her. Ben was shocked to find out he was in love with Vic. They held hands to float together like sea otters do. As the hypothermia set in, Dean asked Ben to raise Pru with Bailey if he were to die. Ben agreed to do so and reminded Dean that he was not alone in anything, that his village was also Dean's and that they would always support him and fight his fight alongside him. A boat then approached but it sailed past them without noticing them. The waves it created forced Dean to let go of Gregory's body, after which Ben helped Dean to stay afloat. Ben then envisioned Joey graduating from med school and thanking Ben, who couldn't be there but without whom he could never have done it. As they watched a plane fly over, Dean reminded Ben of their deal and said he couldn't use his legs anymore, which Ben attributed to the hypothermia. Dean was glad Ben had jumped into the water after him, even though it was stupid, so he didn't have to do this alone. He then said he needed to let go of Ben to give him a chance to survive. The two of them then finally passed out. Their bodies washed ashore, where the coast guard found them. Vic, Sullivan, and Bailey arrived at the scene just as the two men regained consciousness. As they were carried to the aid cars, they held hands.<ref>[[I Guess I'm Floating]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nHe initially clashed with Bailey when their patient woke up on the table while Bailey was operating, which she blamed him for. He later came to Bailey with medical proof and said that it wasn't his fault that the patient woke up. In the second surgery, Bailey said that when she is scared she yells, and that is why she was so mad at him. Ben thought of it as an apology and accepted it.\n\nThey dated for nine months, but after the shooting, Bailey broke up with him, saying she needed to put herself back together. They started dating again after [[Eli Lloyd]] broke things off with her because he was well aware she still loved her ex. They later got engaged and eventually were supposed to get married, but on the way to the wedding Adele Webber was rushed to the ER, and Miranda and Richard went to the hospital. Later they got married. They honeymooned in the Bahamas.\n\nDuring a day off, Miranda told Ben she needed to talk to him. She told him about how even with stepping down temporarily as Chief and changing her diet and exercise, her blood pressure was still too high. She asked him for a sabbatical from their marriage, saying she needed time to get her health in order. He left their home after giving her a last kiss.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter getting back in check with her mental health, Bailey went to Ben and told him that she realized it was her mental health that was the problem, not her physical and she wanted him to come home. He said that she had hurt him really bad, but eventually, he forgave her and showed her this by starting to build the treehouse he promised her after her heart attack. They agreed that they were in it together.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Rosalind Warren]]\nBen was very close to his brother growing up. They shared rooms for most of their lives, even into adulthood. The relationship was strained when Rosalind came out as transgender. Ben didn't really mind that his brother would soon be his sister and accepted her, but he hated the fact that she had kept it from him all those years while they shared basically everything else.\n\n\nDr. Ben Warren was a fifth-year [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] before he decided to be a firefighter at [[SFD Station ]].\n\nHe originally worked as an [[Attending|attending]] [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] at [[Mercy West Medical Center]] prior to the merger with [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. He kept his position as an attending anesthesiologist when he transferred to the merged [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. During his tenure at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Dr. Warren was the anesthesiologist on most of [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey's]] surgical cases and a few on [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd's]] cases. He also supervised [[Resident|anesthesiology residents]].\n\nAfter the events of the hospital shooting, Dr. Warren considered a [[Specialties|specialty]] change into [[Surgery|surgery]] and applied to [[UCLA Medical Center|UCLA's]] [[General Surgery|surgical program]]. At the end of the [[Timeline#Grey's Anatomy Season |- residency year]], Dr. Warren was accepted and soon after, relocated to Los Angeles and began his surgical career as an [[Internship|intern]]. Throughout his intern year, Dr. Warren commuted between Los Angeles and Seattle to spend time with his [[Miranda Bailey|wife]] and [[William George Bailey Jones|step-son]]. During his visits, he was granted privileges at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] by [[Chief of Surgery]] [[Owen Hunt]] and acted as a [[Attending|consulting]] anesthesiologist.\n\nDuring his second-year, Dr. Warren resigned UCLA's [[Resident|surgical residency program]] to move back to Seattle and be closer to his family. He then returned to his former position on the staff as an attending anesthesiologist at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. However, he missed surgery so much that he decided to continue his residency at Grey Sloan Memorial, taking [[Heather Brooks|Heather Brooks']] place in the program.\n\nHe took an interest in [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]] with [[Jackson Avery]] as his mentor, unwillingly forming the new Plastics Posse. However, when he was on Arizona's service due to Richard's switching around, she noticed his talent and requested him on her service.\n\nDuring his fourth year, Dr. Warren was suspended for six months from the surgical residency program by the chief of surgery. His suspension was due to performing unsupervised surgery beyond his scope of authority exacerbated by a perceived error in judgment leading to the death of two patients. He practiced his former specialty of anesthesiology while being suspended. His suspension was lifted by Bailey after he saved April and her daughter.\n\nNearing the end of his fourth year, Ben decided to apply for the Fire Training Academy and started working out every chance he could get. He was accepted and enrolled in the Medic One Program to become a qualified EMT, a requirement for Seattle firefighters. The Medic One Program allowed for his career change to be branded a fellowship in order not to completely disrupt his career as a surgeon, allowing him to return to the hospital at any moment if he sees fit. As part of the Program, Ben did ride-alongs with paramedics.\n\n\n*During [[What is It About Men]], [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] asks Ben about his time as a fifth-year [[Resident|resident]]. This is an error as the [[Resident|residency program]] for [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiology]] is only four years.\n*While a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at UCLA, Dr. Warren retained privileges as an [[Attending|attending]] [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] whenever he visited Seattle.\n*Ben appears to make it a point to try and stay out of his colleagues' personal lives.\n*He has a self-proclaimed impressive running whip stitch technique.\n*His family is \"all about Halloween.\"<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n*He snores and occasionally talks in his sleep.<ref>[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]], x</ref>\n*He had a crush on Thalia Hall in th grade.<ref>[[The Great Pretender]], x</ref>\n*He was the first prominent anesthesiologist in Grey's Anatomy.\n*When he was a surgical resident, the other residents made fun of him for being older than most residents.\n*Before [[Carina DeLuca|Carina]] joined the main cast of Station-, Ben was the only doctor to be the main cast.\n*He had a fear of fires. After going inside a burning building to locate and save [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] and [[Erin Miller|Erin]], he got over his fear and became a firefighter.\n*When he was a surgical resident, his lab coat had Ben Warren embroidered on it, while his official name is Benjamin. Other characters with shortened names, such as Jo and Callie, have their official name embroidered on their lab coats.\n**This is also the case with [[Lexie Grey|Lexie Grey's]] lab coat and later [[Tom Koracick|Tom Koracick's]].\n*Ben is one of the handful of characters that has a [[Specialties|dual-specialty]]: [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiology]] and [[General Surgery|general surgery]]. He joins other characters with dual-specialties such as [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Montgomery]], [[Mark Sloan]], [[Jackson Avery]], [[Sam Bennett]], [[Jake Reilly]], and [[Arizona Robbins]].\n*He loves fantasy basketball.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n*His email password is hothotmiranda.\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxBenWarren.png\nxBenWarren.png\nxBenWarren.png\nSxBenWarren.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Ben-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[The Great Pretender]]\n*[[There's a Fine, Fine Line]]\n*[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\n*[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\n*[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\n*[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]]\n*[[Indoor Fireworks]]\n*[[I Guess I'm Floating]]\n*[[Comfortably Numb]]\n\n\n:'''Ben (to [[Miranda Bailey|Miranda]]): '''Now, woman, I am naked and I look good.

He developed a romantic relationship with [[Meredith Grey]]. He was the younger brother of [[Carina DeLuca]].\n\n\n\nAndrew was born and raised in Italy. His father, also a surgeon, used to take him and his sister Carina out fishing. While in a manic episode, his father operated on seven people in a row without food or sleep and lost four of his patients. Because of his connections, he got away with it, but Andrew's mother left him over it. She then took a young Andrew with her and moved to the United States, while his father and Carina stayed in Italy.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref> At some point, his mother went back to visit his sister in Italy. While she was there, he received a call from Carina that their mother had gotten sick and that he needed to get there as soon as possible. When he arrived, he learned his mother had died even before the call, but Carina couldn't handle telling him that over the phone as she wanted to be able to hug him after delivering the bad news.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nRight after high school, Andrew worked as an EMT. He said he loved it and it's what made him decide to go to medical school. His second call out was an MVC. He arrived to find a woman in the front seat bleeding from her neck. He was trying to stop the bleeding, but she was wailing, holding her dead toddler in her arms. That's when he decided not to go into peds.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\nWhile living on the East Coast, he met [[Sam Bello]] and they had a tumultuous, on-and-off-again relationship. When they broke up, she wouldn't return his calls. In an attempt to get her attention, he kidnapped her dog, so she broke into his apartment to get it back. He then moved across the country to the West Coast without telling her goodbye, so she blocked him on all social media and they didn't hear from each other for years.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn his way to his first day as an intern, Andrew came across the tunnel collapse. When [[Joan Paulson]] was extracted, he rode in with her in the ambulance. When they ran out of splints, he used his tie to stabilize her wrist. After Joan was taken into the hospital, he asked if he needed to fill out paperwork, but Owen, not knowing Andrew is an intern, said that he could do it later if he was okay jumping in and continuing to help.\n\nAndrew was forced to admit that he was only an intern when Joan's neck dislocated and he didn't know how to help Stephanie fix it.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the doctors realized they'd need to get [[Keith Gardner]] to an OR quickly so he wouldn't bleed to death, Andrew, along with the other interns, was posted along the path to clear the way. He then rounded out his first day by rounding on [[Joan Paulson]], who was by then stable and expected to make a full recovery.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nBecause the other interns believed he had posed as an attending on purpose, they didn't want to live with him or be friends with him, so when [[Arizona Robbins]] posted about having a room available to rent, he jumped at the chance. She was initially suspicious, but said they could work it out, and they eventually became friends shortly after.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew attended [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] anatomy class.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Jade Bell collapsed and came to the hospital, Andrew wanted to page neuro after they stitched up her head. Later, when she collapsed in the hospital, Andrew was quick to take a door off its hinges to use as a backboard.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\n\nSeeing that the interns weren't well-trained in delivering bad news to patient families, [[Owen Hunt]] insisted that they all be trained. He taught them the four Ls (Location, language, body language, and leave) and informed them that they'd be telling the families of the people who died in the ER that day.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Andrew was helping Jo get into bed after a night of drinking, Alex walked in and saw Andrew on top of her. Assuming that Andrew was sexually assaulting her, Alex violently physically assaulted Andrew, leading to the former temporarily injuring his hand and the latter sustaining several critical injuries.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew decided to press charges, Alex and his attorney thought it was for a misdemeanor, but quickly learned that the state had upped the charge to felony assault. Alex pled not guilty.\n\nLater, Alex went to the District Attorney's office to take a plea deal, but Andrew unexpectedly walked in and tried to drop all charges against Alex. When he was told that since the case belonged to the state, he could not do that, he threatened to sabotage the case, which the attorney said was \"a slam dunk.\" Andrew walked out before Alex could understand why he decided to drop the charges. The two eventually had a conversation outside of the hospital in which Andrew says that he did it to protect Jo, and expressed frustration that Alex never apologized when he had the chance.\n\n\nAndrew grew concerned over Amelia when he witnessed her diving into [[Beau Martinez|Beau Martinez']] case and ignoring Owen and Megan. He tried to voice those concerns to Jo at Joe's, but she thought he wanted to talk about the two of them dating. He then left the bar and went home, where he found his sister about to have sex with Arizona.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref> After arguing in Italian, Andrew decided he would sleep at the hospital. Carina, knowing that Andrew worked for a female chief of surgery, asked him to introduce her to Bailey and got permission from her to conduct research for her study involving scanning the female orgasm using an MRI at Grey Sloan. Andrew tried to talk Amelia out of operating on Beau given the fact that it could cause more harm, but she persisted.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Carina show Amelia her tumor.]]\nDuring the surgery, Amelia made Andrew get Jackson, forcing him to help despite his refusal to participate in the risky surgery earlier. Afterwards, Jackson told them they got lucky when the surgery turned out successful. Later, when Andrew went to talk to Carina about conducting her research at the hospital he worked at, they found that the current study subject had a brain tumor in her frontal lobe. It was Amelia's.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew has to keep Amelia's tumor a secret while she and Tom plan its removal.]]\nFor a week, Amelia told Andrew to keep her tumor a secret, which he felt uncomfortable about doing. Amelia called her old teacher, [[Tom Koracick]], to come and perform the surgery. While Amelia had another scan, she directed Andrew to gather all of her recent case files for her to go over in case any mistakes were made on her part. Later, Andrew tried to tell Maggie about the tumor by talking to her about their failed relationship in a room with Amelia's brain scans shown throughout the room, hoping Maggie would notice, but she did not. Later, Amelia told her herself.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nDuring Amelia's surgery, Andrew assisted Koracick with the removal of the tumor. Prior to the surgery, Andrew, Amelia, and Tom did the superhero pose together. He tried to ask questions about the procedure, which Amelia had suggested to make Koracick work faster, but he was ignored by Koracick, who was singing to music while operating and told Andrew to either sing or shut up. The surgery was successful and during her recovery, Andrew used early ambulation on Amelia.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew checks on Amelia as she recovers.]]\nKoracick tried to order Andrew to stop as he witnessed her struggle, but Andrew continued, saying that this was Amelia's treatment and that she had ordered him to do it no matter what and to ignore Koracick if he told him to stop. Koracick told Andrew that if anything happened, it was his fault. After Amelia recovered, she asked Andrew to run more scans, because she felt that there was something wrong. To ease her concerns, Andrew brought Amelia the removed tumor and showed it to her. He told her that the reason why she felt something was wrong was because for a long time, there was in fact something wrong, but now there wasn't anymore and that, for her, could feel wrong. She realized he was right and hugged him.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew joins the other men to hang out on Jackson's boat.]]\nJackson invited Andrew to come hang with him and the other men on his newly purchased boat. He asked Andrew to pick up food since they would be grilling. Andrew met them on the boat with several big fish. Jackson organized a fish filleting contest, which Andrew turned out to be good, as he had learned it from his father when he took him and Carina fishing. When Jackson brought up his new apartment, Andrew said he would be looking for a place soon with Sofia moving back to Seattle. Owen then invited him to come live with him for a while. Soon after, the attendings were paged for the intern mixer, leaving Andrew to clean up their mess. Afterwards, he went to the hospital and found Arizona. He told her he would be staying with Owen, after which they saw Carina and Owen kiss. He couldn't believe she was sleeping with another friend of his and opted against moving in with Owen. Later, he came across the new batch of interns and learned that his ex-girlfriend [[Sam Bello]] was one of them.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nGiven their tumultuous history, Andrew ignored her at work. When she confronted him about it, he reminded her of their history and said they only hurt each other when they get together. He thought she followed him to Seattle, but she denied that. Sam had to get burn supplies but she didn't know where to get them, so Ben made Andrew show her. They diverted and ended up having sex in the skills lab. They were caught by Bailey and Webber. When Carina found out, she reminded Andrew that he and Sam were not healthy together. He later ran into her in an on-call room. She went to leave, but he stopped her and asked her to swear she hadn't followed him to Seattle. She told him they were bad for each other. However, they ended up making out again.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nThey had sex everywhere in the hospital all the time, so everybody knew. When the hospital was hacked, Richard taught Andrew some old-school tricks to treat his patients without modern technology.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> Sam started to spiral when the hackers turned up the heat in the hospital. Richard asked Andrew to keep her away from patients. Andrew tried to recuse himself, so Richard revealed he knew about their sexual relationship. He offered to have sex to calm her down, but she told him he was not a person who calmed her down. She said his distracting her didn't make her feel like the brilliant intern she could be, so she decided no more sex. Later, Amelia invited Andrew to be the new Edwards and she also put Sam on her team when she found out that Sam had written a paper that had impressed Amelia.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nShe had them do viability research on five proposed projects for the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. While left alone in the lab, he became distracted by her tongue as she was eating chips, so he retaliated by playing their song. She told him to stop seducing her and quickly left. The next day, they continued and Sam took off her scrub top because reading about neuroscience made her overheat, a fact he remembered well. Amelia then came in and told them to stop the viability studies and instead look into ways to remove gliomas without cutting, as she was looking to cure [[Kimmie Park]]. They found nothing, but Amelia herself came up with the idea to use ultrasound ablation, something that had never been done before in brains. They submitted it as a proposal for the Contest, but it didn't make it to round . They resorted to drinking at Joe's to deal with the disappointment.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Alex decided to continue the research, but their approach only led to frying tissue. [[Tom Koracick]] joined the project and commented on Sam being hot. Tom wondered why Amelia was in such a rush to get results. Unaware that Amelia was keeping Tom away from Kimmie, Andrew showed Tom the scans and introduced him to Kimmie. They later adjusted to using multiple beams to come at the tumor from different angles, which still wasn't perfect but seemed to be the right direction to further explore.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working in the ER, Andrew slipped on a sliced-off ear and hit his head. Amelia had his head scanned and diagnosed a grade  concussion, meaning he had to rest with limited stimuli in a patient room. He was only concerned that Sam saw him fall. His peace and quiet was disturbed when Carina and Arizona came to discuss their maternal mortality project in his room. After encouragement from Amelia, Sam went to his room. Before she could confess her love, he told her they were young before, but now they weren't. They were there together and she was never just sex to him. They confessed their mutual love and decided to try to make it work. She climbed into bed with him and they snuggled there, which was witnessed by Amelia as she walked by.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nApril fetched Andrew to help her out on trauma certification day. At one point, she made him pretend to be dying. Sam had to work on reviving him and they started arguing. April had been spiraling, so intern Casey sent her on a wild goose chase with fake pages as she was the thing that was endangering his patients the most. In an attempt to keep her calm, Andrew brought up that he heard she cheated on her trauma certification, too. She said she did and then lost a patient mere months later because she didn't know what to do. She then fully lost control of herself. She said you can do everything right and people still die and frantically started to perform CPR on a dummy. Andrew checked if she was okay. Distraught, she called off the exercise and went inside.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the time came to test their perfected ultrasound ablation project on [[Noah Brosniak]], the team was very nervous as they were unsure if it would work as they hoped. To calm Amelia down, Andrew initiated the superhero pose. The procedure took a long time because heat built up inside Noah's skull with nowhere to disperse, so they had to wait regularly to let it all cool down. After finishing, Amelia went to throw up and Andrew checked on her. While waiting for Noah to wake up, Andrew and Sam went to sleep in an on-call room. Upon waking up, they realized they had spent their night together again and she wondered about his place. She looked around and discovered a box of his stuff. She realized he was living there. He said he was in between places and she invited him to come live with her.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew thinks Carina called ICE on Sam.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew comforts Sam as she faces deportation.]]\nHe did move in with her. As they arrived at the hospital together, Carina mocked them for playing house, but he bounced back that he was in a monogamous relationship that had lasted longer than any of hers. Later, Taryn came to get Andrew for Meredith. He was told that ICE was looking for Sam to deport her back to El Salvador despite her not having been there since she was one year old and not knowing anyone there. She was there under DACA, but she was caught running a red light, which was apparently reason enough for her to be deported. Meredith suggested a greencard marriage. Andrew was open to the idea, but Sam remembered it wouldn't get her legal status, so they thought about other options. Andrew thought Carina had called ICE on Sam and went to confront her, but she said she would never do that to him or Sam. Andrew returned to the OR where they making plans for Sam and suggested they run away to Canada, but Meredith said ICE was treating her as if she snuck into the country illegally and that they couldn't let her become what they were trying to make her be.\n\nMeredith came up with the idea to send Sam to Switzerland to work under [[Cristina Yang]] as Sam's level of medical training would transfer and provided her with a fake application dated back a year. Sam accepted. They said goodbye as the cab arrived at the hospital. He wanted to follow her to Switzerland as soon as he could, but she didn't want him to throw his life away just because she had to. She then confessed she had in fact followed him to Seattle. She told him they didn't work even if they did. After a last kiss, she left for the airport. Maggie came out to comfort Andrew, but he ignored her and went back inside.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was one of the doctors who ate weed cookies. Arizona took him and Maggie into a skills lab so they could wait for the weed to wear off. He lied down on the ground and hallucinated Sam lying with him. After he spent the better part of the day smiling at the hallucination, he tried to reach out, but his hand went right through her. He started sobbing. Maggie took pity on him and took him back to her house. He got comfortable on the couch and she covered him up with a blanket.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref> He stayed at the house and called in sick to work. He just played some guitar, sang songs he made up, and neglected to shower. He slept while Maggie cooked for them. Meredith tried to get Arizona to talk some sense into him, but Arizona got Carina to do it. Carina accompanied Meredith to her house and yelled at him about his behavior, which would make their father ashamed.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref> On his first day back, he was acting tough with the interns, so Maggie invited him on her case to cheer him up. He assisted her and Arizona as they performed a spina bifida surgery on an exteriorized uterus.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Nicole Herman]] returned to the hospital with headaches, Andrew assisted Amelia to find the cause. Amelia was afraid she would have to tell Nicole about her own tumor if Nicole's tumor had grown back. Since the scans were clear, Andrew performed a spinal tap, which led them to diagnose a spinal fluid leak. They only needed to place a shunt to fix that.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew got drunk at Jo and Alex's wedding with the interns. While the guests were waiting for the officiant, the wedding planner tried to fill up the time with a toast. She passed the mic to Andrew, who talked about how he viewed Jo and Alex as family since blood had been spilled between them. He talked about how have to celebrate true love before it's ripped from your claws. Meredith noticed he was spiraling and cut in to take him for a walk. She told him she knew what it was like to lose your love, but he was young and handsome, so he would find love again. She reminded him to look forward. He then leaned in and kissed her. She stopped it and said she was not seducing him. He thought he would be fired, but she was just flattered. They then found Alex and Jo trapped in a shed and freed them.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew is among the guests for Jo and Alex's impromptu ferry wedding.]]\nThe ceremony was called off because of all the things that had gone wrong, including the wedding planner having an allergic reaction, so all guests boarded the ferry back to the city. Meredith officiated an impromptu wedding for the couple on the ferry.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew slept off his hangover on Maggie and Jackson's couch. He wanted to call in sick, but Jackson made him walk to work with them. While walking, Andrew remembered he had kissed Meredith and he felt horrified. He noticed a car speeding towards the crosswalk and he pulled Maggie and Jackson out of harm's way. The car did hit [[Nisha]]. Andrew called an ambulance and Jackson thanked him for saving their lives. At the hospital, he went to Meredith and apologized for kissing her. He promised it wouldn't happen again, but unbeknownst to him, she had been having sex dreams about him. In the OR, Vik made a bottle of hair product stuck inside a man's rectum explode by cauterizing a bleeding in the area around it. The bottle shot around the OR and hit Vik, whose sleeve caught on fire. Andrew reacted quickly and extinguished the flames. Vik thanked him for saving his life. Andrew and Richard failed to resuscitate the patient.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> The high of saving three lives in one day got Andrew out the slump he'd been in since Sam's departure and he wanted to get back at saving lives. His renewed lust for life led him to buy a motorcycle from a patient after he had had an accident with it. After testing it out, he offered Richard to take a ride.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew's motorcycle attracts attention from the sisters.]]\nHis motorcycle attracted attention from Maggie, Meredith, and Amelia. Maggie tried to set him up with Amelia in an attempt to get her to leave Owen before Teddy could drop her pregnancy bomb on them, but Amelia wasn't interested. Andrew was surprised she would do that given his history with Maggie, but she said their history was ancient. Meredith then caught his eye, as she had been lingering in his mind since the kiss. That night, Andrew took Link and Richard to Joe's bar.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nCarina informed Andrew she would be returning to Italy because there was something going on with their father. She only told him he was not dying, but didn't elaborate further. They came across Meredith, who was dressed up for a date, and Andrew was stunned by her beauty. Andrew, Maggie, and Bailey treated [[Natalie Forrester]], who was rapidly declining. [[Evan Forrester]] tried to keep her impending death from their son [[Max Forrester|Max]], but he had noticed that she wasn't doing well. Andrew took him to the helipad to distract him. Andrew shared with him the story of his mother's death to illustrate that the truth can be scary, but Max only took away from it that his father was lying to him about his mother's death. Max then ran off. Andrew chased after him. While he was looking for Max around the hospital, he came across Carina and told her she was a good sister.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref> Andrew and Maggie joined Station 's search efforts and he was impressed with their work. When the rescue was over, he gave a firefighter's number to Vic, who had been quite hostile towards him for tagging along against protocol.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Owen was out for the day, Richard took charge in the ER and presented Andrew with the opportunity to watch over the interns there. Richard checked in on them stitching up several lacerations and pointed out that Levi needed some pointers, which Andrew then provided. Richard told him he should have noticed that himself and told him to take initiative. Later, a patient needed to be intubated. Levi went to get Richard, but Andrew had done it himself without accepting any help from Taryn by the time he arrived. Richard reminded him they were a teaching hospital. Andrew thought Richard had a problem with him, but Richard said it was the contrary. He needed doctors who not only give the best care but also teach others to do the same, and he saw potential for that in Andrew. After work, Andrew, Link, and Richard went to Joe's again to play guitar and sing.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was supposed to operate on [[Flor Medina]] with Meredith and Alex, but when he discovered that Flor had a little crush on him and preferred he didn't operate on her, he decided to sit the surgery out. He told Meredith he really wanted to work with her, but she said there would be more chances for that in the future. Andrew checked in on Flor after the surgery and sat with her. She asked about some of his favorite things and if he had a girlfriend. He told her he did not have one.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Link both express interest in Meredith.]]\nAfterwards, he ran into Meredith and complimented her on the flower tucked behind her ear. They exchanged some banter about his post-op \"date\" with Flor and he asked about her date, which had been set up by [[Cece Colvin]]. She told him she had scared the guy off. The elevator then arrived and both Andrew and Link held the doors open for her. Confused by their sudden chivalry, she decided to take the stairs.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was put on Cece's case as she started to deteriorate. A patient who got injured in the windstorm proved a perfect match for her. They went to tell Cece and Andrew told her she was only getting this organ because the storm was preventing UNOS from sending the organ anywhere else. He stressed that she was in a bad condition and the chances were real that she would not make it off the table. Nevertheless, Cece accepted the organs and urged Meredith to squeeze all the joy she could out of the life she had been given. Afterwards, Andrew overheard that Meredith accepted Link's invitation for drinks that night. Andrew then found Meredith in the scan room and apologized for having been so blunt with Cece. She called him brave for doing that. He then told her that she had been on his mind since the kiss and that he wanted her to know he was one of her options. He said he was a senior resident, so it wouldn't be an abuse of power, and added that Maggie didn't mind, either. She could make up all the excuses, but he said there was something undeniable between them. They almost kissed, but Meredith said she didn't trust herself. She promised to think about what he had said and left. They later ended up on an elevator together on their way to the OR for Cece. A power outage had the elevator trapped between floors and left them stuck together.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith bond while stuck in an elevator.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Link both ask Meredith out on a date.]]\nNeither of them had a signal. He likened their situation to being in the TARDIS, where time and space and the rules don't apply, but she said the rules still applied. They sat down and she asked him about moving to Italy, promising it would stay between them. In Italian, he shared the story of why his mother and father split up. He then tried to lift her up to the trap door, but she couldn't reach it. She dropped back into his arms and their lips nearly touched. He asked why them kissing would be so bad. She repeated she was his superior and that she was trying to learn from her past mistakes. In Italian, he told her about how badly he wanted to kiss her. She revealed she had taken Italian in college and had therefor understood every word. As they leaned in and nearly kissed, the elevator started working again. The doors opened and she rushed to the OR. She lost Cece in the OR and ran into Andrew after getting off the elevator. He joked she didn't seem to learn from her mistakes as she still used the elevator. She commented on his cocky behavior and he asked her out on a date. Link then came up to ask her the same question. She felt haunted by Cece's ghost and went home to her children without giving an answer to either of them.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nWhenever they operated together, Andrew would observe Meredith closely and try to seduce her. On another case, Andrew had to step up to perform an emergent subtotal colectomy when Owen was accidentally paralyzed by the anesthesiologist. Alex later checked in and told him he had done a great job. On a high, Andrew sent Meredith a text to come celebrate his flying solo with him, but she was getting to know Link at her son's birthday party and ignored him.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew again tried his luck on Christmas Eve and asked Meredith out for a drink, but she was heading home to put her kids to bed so Santa could come. She did, however, invite him to join her to Jo and Alex's NYE party. After they checked on [[Natasha Deon]] and witnessed Meredith talk to Link, Andrew asked her when she was going to stop stringing Link along and giving him false hope. Meredith wasn't sure it was false hope. Andrew was growing tired of wasting time not being with her. He thought she wasn't brave enough to choose him and asked if the NYE party was a date or if she'd ignore him there. She confirmed it was a date. However, she chose to stay with Natasha and [[Garrett Boland|Garrett]] and stood up both Andrew and Link.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew confronts Meredith with her behavior towards him.]]\nHe was angry with her and she apologized but said she had a patient. He told her she also had a phone and that she was just rude to treat him like a doormat. While doing another surgery on Natasha, Levi came out as gay and said he had found someone who made him happy. Andrew said life's too short not to share it with someone who lights up your world, not so subtly hinting at Meredith that he wanted to be with her. On Valentine's Day, Natasha's condition had become dire, but Meredith urged Garrett not to give up. Andrew later questioned how she could tell Garrett that if she herself kept running away from love. He used to think she was so beyond him, but he had changed his mind about that. He called her a kid hiding behind excuses like her job and her family. Meredith then turned around and asked Link out on a date. Andrew was later present when Meredith officiated a wedding between a dying Natasha and Garrett. Afterwards, Andrew took Meredith up the roof for a spontaneous date with champagne. They made a toast to Garrett and Natasha. She decided not to go on her date with Link and shared her first real kiss with Andrew.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith refused to let Andrew take her on a real date until she had cleared it with Maggie, so he resorted to buying her coffee and staring at her longingly at work. She took him aside and told him to quit the staring as it was distracting her. At the end of the day, Meredith paged Andrew to a lounge. She had been given Maggie's blessing and decided she would take him out as she didn't want to sit on the back of his motorcycle. He agreed to the plan but only if it could be his treat. They shared a kiss and left holding hands.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew assisted Meredith while she was breaking the hospital's longest surgery record. He distracted her when she needed him to by telling a story of the time when, as a kid, he believed that he had broken the record of most rollercoaster rides in one day. After the surgery, Andrew found her sleeping on a gurney in a hallway. He transferred her to a bed in an empty room and left her to sleep.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith kiss before heading into the party.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and Andrew realized they caused the \"fire.\"]]\nOn the day of Catherine's party, Meredith informed Chief Karev of their relationship. They went to the party together, but as they had her house to themselves, they didn't plan on staying long. However, Meredith got sucked into Amelia's drama with Owen, preventing them from leaving soon. As Amelia was planning to come sleep at the house, Meredith and Andrew resorted to making out in the guest room. He got a call from Carina, but he declined it to keep on kissing his girlfriend. They were caught by Richard, who awkwardly left. They went back downstairs to the party and, in an attempt to act normal, took over from the catering staff. They put a tray of egg rolls in the oven. The tray was made out of plastic and caused the entire apartment to fill with smoke. Everyone was evacuated. While out on the street, they decided to go to Andrew's place to avoid any further distractions. However, as they arrived there, so did Carina and Vincenzo, their father. He greeted his son and Andrew introduced Meredith to him.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nThe siblings caught up and Andrew found out that his father had come here to pitch medical research. He seemed stable to him while Carina insisted he was bipolar. He briefly visited Meredith in her lab for a kiss and then joined his family for the research pitch to Alex. Vincenzo was looking for funding for external gestational research, which he had already gotten to the stage of animal trials. After  days, a healthy sheep was born. Alex asked for some time to consider. Andrew and Vincenzo then got coffee. Vincenzo told him he was hoping they could make up for the time they had lost because his controlling mother had come between them. He assured Andrew that the research would put him on the map so that Meredith wouldn't be beyond him anymore.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew asks Meredith to trust his judgment about his father.]]\nLater, Meredith found Andrew and Carina arguing. Andrew had decided to sign on for the research, while Carina insisted their father wasn't well. She stated she knew their father better than Andrew did and that their father knew how to manipulate Andrew into doing his bidding. Meredith had her doubts, knowing full well how clouded one's judgment can get, but Andrew was sure on the matter and asked her to trust him on it. Alex decided to fund the research. Before helping their father set up in the lab, the siblings met outside. Still on the fence about it herself, Carina hoped Andrew was right about this.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew wakes up in the lab.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Carina and her father have a fight.]]\nAndrew spent all his time on the research and even spent nights in the lab to monitor the lambs. Meredith brought him coffee as a peace offering to apologize for her suspicions about his dad. He appreciated that and invited her to spend a night at his place if were to spend it there himself. She accepted and went to work. That morning, a lamb died and an argument erupted between Carina and Vincenzo, who threw the former off the study. Alex had them write a report on the matter so he could review it. Carina pleaded with Andrew to see their father's illness, but Andrew insisted he was fine. Carina thought the project was too important to let it be ruined by their father. Andrew insisted she didn't have the right degree to diagnose him and that she always butted heads with their father like this. While continuing the work, Andrew told his father to control his tantrums because they didn't help their credibility. They discussed Carina backing out and Vincenzo wanted to reach out to make peace, but Andrew told him that she was occupied with a trauma patient who might lose her baby. Vincenzo went behind everyone's backs and pitched his research as a solution to the couple. He was scolded by Alex, but Vincenzo couldn't understand that it was way too soon for human trials.\n\nAndrew then finally saw the truth, but Vincenzo remained unbothered, stating he was the only one willing to do what it took to save that baby. Andrew realized it was just like that night when he insisted on saving those seven people by himself. Andrew told him that letting the baby die now was merciful compared to letting it die in a bag by the hands of a mad scientist who didn't know what he was doing, but Vincenzo did not agree. Alex then gathered the DeLucas in his office and announced he was pulling the funding. Infuriated and unwilling to let someone take over, Vincenzo packed up his stuff and moved his research back to Italy. Meredith visited Andrew as he was cleaning out the lab and he lashed out at her. She stated she would never tell she had been right. He apologized and said he shouldn't be around people. She told him to let her know if he needed anything and left.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew continued to keep his distance from Meredith. Andrew got put on Alex's service for a total pancreatectomy. The surgery was cancelled because the girl's labs showed a high glycemia. Alex told Andrew he was sorry about the cancellation. Suspecting Meredith had pulled strings to cheer him up, Andrew yelled that he didn't need any favors from him. Later, the doctors discovered that the girl had sabotaged her surgery by drinking juice. They found out she didn't want the surgery because then she would have to go back to school, where she was bullied. Andrew pushed the mother too hard to convince her daughter to get the surgery, so Alex threw him off the case. Andrew then went to talk to the girl behind Alex's back and shared how he had survived being bullied himself. Alex then performed the surgery without Andrew to punish him for disobeying him. Later, Andrew yelled at Alex for being unprofessional, but Alex told him that he was the unprofessional. He should have talked to Nora first before going at her mother like he did. Alex understood parents can do a number on their kids, but Andrew let it interfere with his job and his relationship today. Alex also told him not to bite people's hand when they reach out, because then they stop doing so. That night, Meredith visited him at home and told him she was past the time of wondering if her boyfriend was ignoring her. Andrew understood and said it hurt him that he was unable to help his father, so he needed some time to hurt and he didn't want to drag her down with him. Now he was ready to let her back in. He cooked them dinner and they enjoyed each other's company.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nRichard scheduled a solo lap appy for Andrew. Andrew examined the patient, who complimented him on his looks in front of Richard. She then asked Andrew to check out her Instagram. Richard told him it was part of the job so Andrew complied and listened to the patient talk about crossfit. In surgery, Richard asked about the long-term plan. Andrew thought he was talking about his relationship with Meredith and said they hadn't discussed it yet. He said he respected where Meredith came from and that she was amazing to him. Richard then said he meant Andrew's career. Andrew said he was attracted to general surgery. The surgery had to be converted to an open procedure when they came across dead bowel. Richard wanted to take over, but Andrew knew the steps of an ileocecectomy and pulled it off. Once Andrew was done, Richard complimented Andrew and said he'd put in a good word with the head of general surgery. That night, Meredith and Andrew had dinner at his place again and he talked her through his day.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nAs their relationship progressed, they also had sex at Meredith's house, but she wouldn't allow him to sleep over yet. One night, when he was sneaking out, he ran into Zola as she was getting some water from the kitchen. He returned to Meredith to tell her about it. She hated that her plan on how to tell them was now ruined, but he was just glad she had been planning to do so. She then checked if the coast was clear before sending him out again. Later at work, Meredith told him Zola appeared to be fine and she asked if he liked kids. He did, citing his  first cousins whom he all adored. Later, Meredith and Andrew had to deliver a baby of a woman who didn't know she was pregnant. Meredith later watched Andrew hold the baby in the woman's room, which convinced her to tell her kids about him.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile working in the clinic, Andrew encountered [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabriella]] and her father [[Luis Rivera]]. Luis had come to the U.S. on a visa and applied for asylum. He sent for his family once he had an apartment, but they were detained and separated at the border. Gabby had just arrived in Seattle with severe abdominal pain, having received little medical care while in detention. She was diagnosed with an obstruction and required surgery, for which Luis couldn't pay. Andrew took him to fill out forms to apply for state coverage, but it was denied because he made too much money cleaning offices. Meredith, who had joined the case, promised that she had a plan, which turned out to be filling out Ellis's name on the paperwork so they could benefit from her insurance. She knew it was wrong, but insisted that she was trying to remedy something even more wrong. However, in surgery, it was discovered that the obstruction was caused by a lymphoma, meaning the case wouldn't be over with just the one surgery. Andrew stood by as Meredith and Richard decided to make Gabby sicker on paper and keep her hospitalized for  days so that a new state policy would kick in, which was regardless of income. Throughout the day, Andrew had been quiet, so Meredith assumed he disapproved of her actions. However, he was actually in awe of her. He told her he could have been Gabby when he had come here from Italy and he loved that she didn't look away from the situation like so many people do. He had been quiet because he was afraid he'd tell her that he loved her if he opened his mouth. Taken aback, she told him she was glad they had cleared that up and quickly left.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew spent the night in a chair next to Gabby's bed. She woke him up by throwing her stuffed animals at him. Later, when she admitted to being scared of the MRI, he took her there to take a scan of one of her stuffed animals to show her how it worked. Alex walked in as he was doing so and hinted to a career in peds. Later, Andrew met Jo and Meredith outside of the conference room where Bailey and Catherine had been holed up all day. Meredith asked him to look after Jo while she went off to look for Alex. Jo brought up his love confession to Meredith, but he was soon paged to the room by Bailey.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew takes the fall for Meredith.]]\nInside, he was informed that the insurance company had discovered the insurance fraud. Andrew took the fall for Meredith. Before he was arrested, he was allowed to go inform Meredith, who was stuck inside the pressurized hyperbaric chamber, of what he had done. He told her he had lied to her about Gabby having insurance and he apologized for using her daughter's name. He said what he did wasn't fair to her or her kids, who needed her. Meredith realized what he was doing and begged him not to, but his mind was made up and he was taken away by Catherine.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was arrested and escorted out of the hospital. Meredith later visited him in jail and told him his move was stupid, stating he would lose his license. He said he was called into a room and asked for details and he couldn't bring himself to turn her in. She told him that he needed to develop some instincts for self-preservation if they were going to be together. She wanted to clean up her own messes and live in her truth, because what she was trying to remedy was so much more wrong than what she did. Meredith then told him she was going to turn herself in to get it out. She admitted she felt terrified. She stated she loved him, too, and then walked out to go turn herself in.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith came clean and the charges against Andrew were dismissed. He sat in her corner during her meeting, where she confessed to not really regretting her actions, instead blaming the system, which landed her with court-ordered community service to pick up trash on the streets. He then returned to work with a cocky attitude to Bailey, knowing she was in need of help. He was put on the case of [[Jai Prishna]]. He convinced Jai's wife Mari not to give up hope just yet despite Jai living his worst nightmare of being hooked to machines. He promised to tell her when it was time to give up hope, but a week later, Jai recovered without deficits. After a few weeks of community service, Meredith ate ice cream with Andrew and told him that word of her community service got out at Zola's school, but she didn't care because she and her kids were healthy and she had found some sense of accomplishment in the work. As he joked about robbing a store to get some roadside vacation himself, her happiness disappeared when she found out that the medical board was pursuing action against her license.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was dropping Meredith off for her community service when she found out that her medical license hearing was in three months. With the other residents, Andrew partook in Bailey's skills lab on the axillary-bifemoral bypass for [[Wade Foltz]], where he pointed out she was using different grafts than Meredith. He finished first in the skills lab but while Bailey had promised that the first one to finish would get to do the anastomosis, she chose Taryn instead, who had finished mere seconds after him. She did allow him to scrub in with them. When there was a bleeding from Taryn's suture line, Bailey had Andrew step in to fix it. Wade was fine in post-op. Andrew confronted Bailey with her choosing Taryn while he should have been the one to do that part of the surgery. He suggested she had sidelined him because of his relationship with Meredith. She warned him not to question her methods, as Taryn needed to experience the adrenaline and fear that makes you a surgeon, and told him not to make this personal. She suggested he started thinking about his career and let go of certain loyalties. After work at Meredith's, he was told by Meredith that she was going to write an article about the brokenness of the medical system after all the problems she had seen while on community service.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nWhile dropping Meredith off again, she told him she had gotten in touch with a website that was interested in publishing her article on the medical system. She listed some ideas she had, all of which would rub the medical community the wrong way. She didn't care since they were already in a fight anyway. At work, Andrew had to take responsibility and face Bailey's anger when Levi let a catheter guide wire slip into a patient under his supervision. They managed to save the patient in the cath lab. Afterwards, Andrew had Levi tell the patient's family but he had to take over as Levi was being too elaborate with needless details. At home, he told Meredith about it while having Link and Amelia over. The pair came to share the news that she was pregnant. Andrew congratulated them.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nMuch to her surprise, the website had pulled all of Meredith's ideas into one article that trashed Grey Sloan instead of the medical system itself. Andrew noticed the residents were panicking about the effect that would have on their future careers but they tried to shut him out because of his involvement with Meredith. He went to see Bailey and told him there were also some scheduling conflicts, which the Chief Resident couldn't resolve since she quit over the article. Bailey then appointed him Chief Resident and told him to go fix the mess his girlfriend had made. Andrew let Meredith know how mad Bailey was. In the evening, he came across Meredith in the hospital and learned she had tried to explain the situation to Bailey, which didn't go well, and that she got a summons to court since her supervisor had informed the judge that she had walked out on work crew. Andrew hated that she made a choice that could land her in jail and was actively adding to the threat of her losing her license. He wanted her to lay low, do her hours, and return to work to change the system from within. She pointed out nothing she wrote was a lie and refused to sit on her mountain of privilege and let other people fight their own battles. She grew upset and told him that if he really expected her to sit back and let people be hurt and killed by the broken system, he didn't know her at all.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nTom put Andrew on his service to get him to make Meredith make things right with Grey Sloan. He suggested withholding sex but Andrew said that wouldn't work on her. Meredith then appeared with a sick Zola and asked Tom to do a head CT. The CT revealed her shunt needed to be revised. Since she was supposed to appear before the judge that day, Andrew told Meredith he would keep an eye out for Zola so she could go, which angered her. He also offered to sit with Meredith during the surgery but she also hated that he was offering to skip out on surgeries in his residency just to be her human tissue. The surgery went well and Meredith had him to stay with Zola in post-op. In the evening, she ran into him when she went out to look for Jello for her daughter. Andrew had anticipated that request and handed her a cup. Meredith's lawyer then came up and informed them that she would have to make up the hours she skipped out on community service in jail.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, while Meredith was in jail, Andrew came to pick up the kids to drive them to school. He wanted to help Zola out with her costume wings but she rejected his help, telling him he was not her father. While working together with Jackson, Jackson inquired about Meredith. Andrew admitted he didn't really know how she was doing as her eight allowed minutes of phone time mostly went to him telling her about her kids. He explained he was helping out and told him about Zola's reaction. Jackson said that with kids, there's almost always a reason for such behavior. During rounds, Maggie came to drop off Zola with him as she had a surgery and Zola was refusing to go to daycare. Zola read her book while Andrew rounded on his patients but eventually discovered that she has disappeared from her chair. He found her in the gallery and asked her if he did anything wrong that morning. She didn't like it when people touched her wings because her dad fixed them before he died. She admitted she was scared she was going to forget him. Andrew assured her that wouldn't happen as Derek was such a legend that people would keep talking about him, which is how Andrew himself learned a lot about him. He told her the story of how her father had saved [[Isaac (Season )|Isaac]], which made Zola warm up to him again. They went trick-or-treating together. While they were sorting out the candy, Meredith came home from jail. He shortly greeted her while she hugged her kids, whom he took back to sorting the candy while Meredith spoke to her sisters.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew accompanied Meredith, her sisters, and Alex to the hotel for her hearing before the medical commission. Andrew was called to testify and questioned about when he had found out about the fraud. He said he hadn't until Richard did. The panel knew about his and Meredith's relationship through documentation from HR. Andrew assured them that the relationship was consensual and that Meredith hadn't forced him to keep the fraud quiet. He was also questioned about paperwork that detailed his being mistreated by attendings, including Meredith, after being assaulted by Alex. Andrew said that was ancient history and apologized to Meredith for hurting her case but she told him it was okay. During a short recess, Andrew and Meredith sat down and she told him their relationship wouldn't survive if she were to lose her license while he would still get to cut. Andrew followed the hearing, which ended with Meredith getting to keep her license. Andrew briefly hugged her but then disappeared as she turned to her other colleagues. He visited her at home and asked to talk. She apologized to him for what she had said but he knew she had meant it. He told her he stood up for her in court and the hospital and went to jail for her because he loved her. The whole experience made him realize that she didn't see him as her partner. When she talked about Derek in that hearing, he finally understood a feeling he had been having for a while, which was that she loved Derek but respected him, too. Meredith said she respected Andrew as well but he knew some part of her wasn't sure if he would ever be on her level. He told her to take some time to figure out what she wanted and whether he was part of that or not.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nOn her first day back, Andrew was surprised to see her. She told him she had wanted to tell him Bailey had re-hired her but he had been too busy dumping her. He said he didn't dump her but she said it was all the same to her. Together with all the other residents, they started rounds, during which they met [[Cormac Hayes]], the new Head of Pediatric Surgery. While scrubbing in, Andrew told Link and Nico about his inadvertent dumping of Meredith. They pointed out he wasn't her equal and might never be but, given their own relationships, they knew that that didn't mean she didn't respect him. They advised him to go find Meredith and undo what he did. He eventually found her but after watching her for a bit, he just walked off without talking to her.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nDespite multiple traumas coming in due to the car crash at Joe's bar, Tom tasked Andrew with babysitting [[Elliott Calhoun]] in the ICU. While doing that, Andrew texted Meredith asking if they could talk later. Elliott's heart then started beating again. Andrew went to find Teddy, who told him to prep Elliott and then she'd join him to take Elliott off ECMO. That went well and Elliott's wife thanked Andrew for saving her husband, though Andrew acknowledged it wasn't actually his doing. Andrew then visited Maggie at home to let her know that Elliott had made it through. She was relieved to hear that. Andrew then asked her for advice on how to deal with issues with Meredith as he meant some of the things of he had said but he realized that asking her to take time was wrong. Maggie only said he had hurt a woman who had been hurt more than enough for a lifetime. Andrew then stood there as she was served with a lawsuit over Sabi's death.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith came to find Andrew at work and told him she missed him. He reminded her he hadn't broken up with her so she didn't have to miss him. He then told her that [[Suzanne Britland]], his post-op appy patient was inexplicably running fevers. She told him she'd think about it but advised him to take it up to Bailey. They did scans that confirmed Andrew didn't make a mistake during his surgery but didn't give them any pointers as to why Suzanne had also suddenly developed a cardiac tamponade. As they were clueless, Bailey instructed Andrew to create a war room and gather all the people who could help them. Meredith found him there and had him talk her through the entire case.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThey reconciled while working together closely and Andrew spent the night at her place. Whilst making out with her in the morning, Andrew was paged because Suzanne had been transferred to the CCU. He told her he had used her name to lure [[Lauren Riley]], a diagnostics genius from San Francisco, to help them on the case. Andrew wanted to talk about the status of their relationship but Meredith wanted him to get to Suzanne first. Andrew pressured the residents to work on the case and visited Suzanne, who had found Meredith's hospital from hell article. After Andrew explained the situation, Lauren Riley arrived and explained her method of starting over from the beginning. Outside, Lauren asked Andrew to get Meredith. He claimed she was in surgery but Maggie pointed out she was standing nearby. Meredith's puzzled reaction made Lauren realize that she had been lied to. Andrew begged her to stay, which worked. He watched closely as Maggie, on her first day back, operated on Suzanne. After the surgery, Lauren recommended withdrawing all medication to see if certain symptoms had been masked. She and Andrew presented their idea to Suzanne whilst underlining that Lauren was the best at what she does, with Lauren sharing a story of her own three sisters to ease Hadley and Suzanne's concerns about the hospital. Suzanne then consented. Outside the room, Lauren confessed to Andrew that she was an only child and had lied with ease to get Suzanne to consent.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nAs Suzanne's condition worsened over the next three days, Andrew began to question the approach but Lauren insisted. Determined to end Suzanne's suffering, Andrew rudely interrupted a conversation between Meredith and Cormac to ask her about a certain patient from the past with some similar symptoms to Suzanne's. Cormac pointed out his rudeness and left. Both Carina and Meredith noticed how fast Andrew was talking as he explained his query. Concerned, they asked when he had slept last, which he refused to answer to. Lauren then came to inform him the pericardial biopsy came back negative for carcinomatosis. Meredith questioned their progress but Lauren said every diagnosis ruled out was progress. Meredith then pointed out that Andrew was fried and appeared obsessed. Lauren said he knew the case inside out and she was relying on his being obsessed. Suzanne began bleeding from her mouth and Andrew saw that all her blood cell counts had gone down. While performing a bone marrow biopsy, Lauren asked Andrew if he was still sleeping with Meredith. She had observed the way they argued, which made her figure it out. He confessed that he wasn't sure but Lauren said it explained her concern over his wellbeing. Soon after, Bailey called Andrew into her office to inform him that Meredith was taking over Suzanne's case, with the first step being putting her back on her meds. Andrew began objecting, stating he hadn't made any mistakes, but Bailey cut him off before he could say something he would regret later. Just as Lauren was packing up her stuff, with all of her progress being undone, the results of the biopsy came back, which made Lauren diagnose Still's disease. They rushed to her room and injected steroids into Suzanne's IV without informing Meredith of what they were doing. Meredith asked Andrew for a word outside but he ignored her and left.\n\nIt turned out they were right and Suzanne soon felt better. Meredith told Andrew to go into her room so they could thank him, but he snapped that she could go in and take the credit for her patient. He said he saved Suzanne's life no thanks to her. Meredith pointed out his career would have been over if he had been wrong after what he pulled. He asked if she would have given permission. She admitted she would have asked some questions because she didn't think he was in the right state of mind to make life-or-death decision. Andrew insisted it was the right decision. As she said he wasn't acting like himself, he yelled that she was a hypocrite as she never followed rules herself. Having overheard his outburst, Cormac stepped in to stand up for Meredith. Andrew went on to say how he had saved Suzanne's life against all odds. Meredith pointed out he was sounding like his father and told him to get some sleep. Andrew then said he didn't need any of this nor Meredith, so they were done. He walked off to go watch Suzanne being reunited with her kids.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAs a blizzard raged over Seattle, Andrew overheard that one of Cormac's patients couldn't get their liver transplant because the liver couldn't be transferred from Seattle Pres to Grey Sloan. Andrew said he would personally get the liver. Meredith tried to talk him out of it, pointing out people were freezing to death, but he brushed it off, saying he was used to the cold. He expected her to bring up his father again and left, going out into the cold to retrieve the liver. He eventually returned with the liver, which he delivered straight to the OR, with frostbitten fingers. Against his wishes, Andrew was brought to a treatment room where Jackson started working on his hands while Andrew and Carina argued over his careless behavior. Andrew wanted to go treat patients but Jackson pointed out he would lose his hands and career if he didn't stay for treatment. Jackson did his best and said the next twelve hours were critical. Carina and Meredith came to his room. Meredith said the child made it. He aggressively said she would be dead if Meredith had had things her way. Carina said they were worried about him. Carina said this was just like when their father started showing symptoms, at the same age as Andrew was now. Andrew's response was throwing Meredith out of his room.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nAt odds with Meredith yet again, Andrew had to sit through mandatory therapy with [[Cynthia Cole]], who had to sign off on him before he could operate again. During the session, he insisted he didn't need to be there and denied having experienced any symptoms of mania. He claimed he had just had a stressful couple of weeks but that his behavior had only saved patients' lives. After the session, he went to the ER and fixed the overflow. With Richard having given up his service, he thought that he could help out, but Bailey still forbade him from treating patients. After work, Andrew ran into Jo at the bar and offered her a drink. He suggested that since they were both single now, they could have sex. She threw her drink in his face and told him to get help.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew examined a teenage patient who came into the clinic under the name [[Erin Banks|Cindy Wright]] with her aunt [[Opal]]. He began to suspect that the \"aunt\" was really a human trafficker due to her always answering questions for the girl and never leaving her side. He brought his concerns to Dr. Bailey who doubted him due to his deteriorating mental health but she still visited the patient herself. She didn't find any cause for concern and took Andrew off the case, telling him to meet her in her office the next morning. However, Andrew was not convinced and took \"Cindy\" up to the surgical floor, where family members are not allowed.\n\nEventually, Andrew and the unsuspecting patient made their way to the waiting room, where a crowd formed as he stood between Opal and Cindy to keep them apart. He frantically asked for security to detain Opal but Dr. Bailey stopped them and Carina begged for him to stop his behavior. He called for everyone to follow protocol and make a human chain around Opal, but instead they exchanged sad looks and formed the chain around him. Opal and Cindy rushed together and comforted each other as Andrew stood on a chair and yelled that Opal was selling people and their affection was a trauma bond, not love. Dr. Bailey tells Andrew to go with security or he will be banned from the hospital, causing him to break down as he realized that no one supported his belief. He went with them and quit his job instead of accepting the suspension that Bailey gave him. Meredith followed him into a stairwell after seeing Dr. Bailey chase after him. He told Meredith that the more he tries to accomplish the impossible and change people's lives, the more he's judged and called crazy. She comforted him and begged for him to take the suspension instead of quitting. They made an agreement that he would as long as Dr. Bailey would call the national trafficking hotline to have them investigate Opal.\n\nShortly afterward, Opal forcefully escorted Cindy out of the emergency room undetected. She thought Cindy said something to Andrew, but Cindy insisted she didn't. Unaware of the pair being gone, Dr. Bailey called the hotline and they told her not to scare Opal off. However, since she had already left, all Dr. Bailey and Meredith could do was hope that Andrew wasn't right.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nDespite being placed on leave, Andrew returned unofficially to help diagnose Richard after his public meltdown at a conference. Andrew barely slept during the weeks he researched possible causes with Meredith. He prevented Catherine from her attempt to take Richard home and rushed into the OR when Dr. Bailey was preparing to conduct Richard's nerve biopsy. She tried to kick him out of the room but he knocked over her instrument tray and convinced her to test Richard's blood for cobalt poisoning because of a past hip replacement that could be deteriorating. Andrew's diagnosis was correct and he was allowed to scrub in (but not touch Richard) after Meredith reminded Dr. Bailey that the major save was because of him.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Andrew entered a severe depressive state. Despite this, he managed to visit Cindy when she came back to the hospital in a worse condition, this time without Opal. He was right about her being a victim of human trafficking and he was the only one she would trust. Andrew comforted her and stayed with her, eventually learning that her real name is Erin Banks. The doctors called the police and informed them. Andrew's depressive episode continued and Richard, Meredith, Bailey, and Carina staged an intervention with the support of his psychiatrist. After being defensive for a moment, he broke down and said his one goal in life was to not end up like his father. He admitted he was not okay but did not know what to do and the group got him to agree to going on medication to help manage his condition.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> He worked on his mental health after the intervention and his relationships with the group improved, eventually getting involved with Meredith's COVID- treatment and supporting Dr. Bailey after her mother's death.\n\nOpal returned to the hospital during the pandemic to check on an accomplice of hers who had been arrested and brought to the hospital after a botched trafficking scheme. Unaware of who she was, Levi noticed her and examined her when she claimed she had been mugged. He brought a police officer to take her statement on the mugging so she made up a story. She left shortly afterward due to the risk of being at Grey-Sloan. Andrew spotted her in the parking lot and enlisted the help of Carina in following Opal so he would not lose her again.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nWhile trailing Opal through Seattle,  Andrew was stabbed by an unknown assailant. Opal and the attacker were arrested as Andrew was rushed to Grey-Sloan, where he was treated in surgery by Hunt, Altman, and [[Reza Khan|Khan]]. During this time, Andrew was on the beach with Meredith in her dream sequence, where they were able to share some moments together. He told her that he didn't regret following Opal because we go through life ignoring atrocities all the time, but it makes sense to fight for people. Back in the real world, he woke up and Carina told him that the traffickers were arrested so he saved a lot of kids but she was still mad at him. Though the initial surgery was a success, Andrew later suffered a cardiac tamponade and went into DIC, resulting in the need for him to return to surgery. Meanwhile, Meredith and Andrew saw a woman calling to Andrew on the beach: his deceased mother. Andrew said he needed to go and Meredith told him that she would miss him. He ran off to reunite with his mother. At the same time, Khan told Altman, Hunt, and the rest of the surgical team that Andrew\us heart would not restart as he had already been down for forty minutes. They reluctantly stopped and Andrew flatlined. Khan asked if anyone was going to call time of death but was met only with silence and heartbroken looks. He called time of death as :, and Andrew and his mother walked away on the beach, arm in arm.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew was very confident and easygoing. He had a strong emotional and soft side, especially when it came to romantic relationships. Sometimes he could make very irrational decisions.\n\n\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nAfter not being able to save one of the twins, Andrew ended up at the bar getting drunk with Maggie. She kissed him, and they ended up sleeping together.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref> The next day, she avoided him and then told him that it wouldn't be happening again. Despite this, they began kissing and had sex again.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie and Andrew at Joe's bar]]After they had sex, Maggie had the repeated, urgent need to urinate, so she came back to the hospital. Because OB was understaffed, Andrew came in to examine her. She believed he may have given her an STI. After her exam, she and Andrew talked about how he didn't automatically assume that she gave him something, so she shouldn't automatically assume he gave her something and he said that she could get the test results later, but if she wanted to know anything about his history, she could ask or she could just trust him.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew touched her affectionately while working on a case, Maggie told him he couldn't do that anymore. They needed to keep it professional at work. She admitted to having feelings for him and asked if he could keep it professional at work. He said he could.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen an ambulance exploded in the ER, Maggie repeatedly paged Andrew. He found her and told her she needed to stop paging him so much, but she admitted she was worried about him, believing he'd been in the blast.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after they went public, Andrew became uncomfortable with the way things changed when people knew he was seeing an attending and he started to avoid her. When she confronted him, he ended things with her.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Sam Bello]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Sam and Andrew at a hospital party]]While the details of Andrew and Sam's relationship are unknown, it is known that they had a very complicated, on-and-off relationship for years. The first time they broke up, he stayed on his sister Carina's couch for weeks. He seemed to dislike having Sam in Seattle and tried his best to ignore and avoid her. After she assured him that she didn't come to Seattle for him, they ended up having sex in an on-call room, despite knowing their relationship wasn't good for either of them.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref> [[Jo Wilson]] and [[Alex Karev]] discuss that Andrew and Sam continued to do this every day.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> \n\nThey eventually moved in together as their relationship grew more serious. However, when Sam was discovered by ICE and was in risk of deportation, she decided to continue her medical career in Switzerland under [[Cristina Yang]] and left the country.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref> After Andrew and Sam broke up, Andrew went to Meredith Grey's house and stayed on the couch, not able to get over Sam. At Jo and Alex's wedding, he got drunk out of misery, leading him to kiss Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew drunkenly kissed Meredith, and she rejected his advances, though she said she was flattered. The next day, Andrew remembered what he did and apologized to Meredith, who, unbeknownst to Andrew, was having sex dreams about him. Andrew soon realized he had feelings for Meredith and tried to keep them in tact while she began dating other people with the help of her matchmaker patient. However, during the superstorm, when Andrew saw that Meredith might start dating [[Atticus Lincoln]], he confessed his feelings for her. Meredith told him she had to think about it, but that same day, they got trapped in the elevator, where they learn more about each other, such as that they both speak Italian. They almost kissed until the elevator began working again.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith and Andrew at Catherine's party]]Now that Meredith was fully aware of Andrew's feelings for her, Andrew began to pursue Meredith in competition with her other suitor, Link. Though Meredith initially tried to resist her interest in Andrew by setting up a date with Link, she eventually chose Andrew to be with, and they shared their first kiss on the hospital roof on Valentine's Day. After getting Maggie's approval, Meredith allowed Andrew to take her out on a date, starting their relationship officially.\n\nWhen operating with Richard on a woman's appendectomy, Andrew told him that, while he and Meredith hadn't had any serious conversations about their future yet, she makes him so happy, earning him Richard's approval on the relationship. After Zola caught Andrew trying to sneak out of Meredith's room in the middle of the night, Meredith asked Andrew if he even liked kids, to which he responded that he has sixteen cousins and that her kids might like him more than her. That night, Meredith told her kids about her relationship with Andrew, which they warmly welcomed.\n\nAfter watching Meredith commit insurance fraud for Gabby Rivera's case, Andrew didn't say anything, but looked like he disapproved as they operated on Gabby. Later that day, Meredith told him that she could not apologize for her actions, as she did them to save a family. Andrew told Meredith that she had it all wrong; he was silent because he was in awe of what she did and that he was worried he would accidentally blurt out that he loves her. Though Meredith didn't say it back at first, she eventually told him she loves him too after he took the fall for the insurance fraud and landed himself in jail.\n\nAfter Meredith's trial, he told her that he saw the way she talked about Derek, and said that she didn't just love Derek, she respected him. Meredith said he couldn't compare the two, but Andrew told her to take some time.\n\nWhen Andrew drove himself sleepless from a patient, Suzanne, Carina voiced her concerns to Meredith that he might have the same mania as their father. Meredith took over Suzanne's case and didn't agree with Andrew's course of treatment. However, his treatment led to the discovery of Suzanne having Still's disease. Andrew was angry with Meredith, since if they had followed her idea, they'd never have diagnosed Suzanne. During their fight, Meredith told him he was acting like his father. This only angered Andrew further, and he ended up breaking up with Meredith completely.\n\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nAt a young age, he and his mother moved to the United States while his sister, Carina, stayed behind in Italy with their father. Carina came to Seattle to do research about the female orgasm and discovered Amelia's brain tumor. While in Seattle, Carina also served as OB/GYN when needed.\n\n[[Vincenzo DeLuca]]\nAndrew and his father have a complicated relationship. Vincenzo took him and his sister out on fishing trips, took him on trips on the back of his motorcycle, and taught him how to play soccer and the names of the stars. However, Vincenzo also killed four people while operating in a manic state and never took responsibility for it as he got away with it because of his connections.\n\nAfter Catherine's party, just as Andrew was about to show Meredith his apartment, Carina returned to America with Vincenzo, who was here to propose research for an external womb to the hospital. While Carina didn't trust their father's mental state, Andrew signed on to work on the project after Vincenzo told him this would put him on the map. However, Vincenzo's manic symptoms started to show when the project started failing, leading him to offer the incomplete research to a hospital patient. Andrew had an emotional confrontation with Vincenzo, the project was shut down, and Vincenzo returned to Italy.\n\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nOne evening, Jo was drunk and Andrew took her home. Jo confessed that she couldn't marry Alex because she was already married. When Alex came home, he saw Andrew on top of Jo and thought Andrew was attempting to assault her. Andrew tried to defend himself, but Alex repeatedly punched Andrew. Shortly afterward, Alex was arrested for the assault while Andrew was treated at the hospital. In the aftermath of Alex's arrest, Andrew and Jo bonded because they weren't allowed to speak to others about the trial. When Jo learned that she had to testify, she worried that she would have to talk about her husband. Not wanting to put her through that trouble, Andrew told the DA he'd refuse to cooperate, forcing them to drop the charges against Alex.\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nHe got off to a bad start with Alex, who mistakenly believed Andrew hated kids because he didn't want to work in peds.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref> He was later attacked by Alex at Alex and Jo's apartment because Alex saw him on top of Jo when she was drunk.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> While Alex awaited trial for assault, the two avoided each other. The night before Alex's trial, he decided to take a plea deal to get two years, but before he could do so, Andrew came in and told the DA he wanted to drop the charges. When the DA said it wasn't his case to drop, Andrew said he'd say that it was all a misunderstanding that got out of hand, tanking the DA's case.<ref>[[Jukebox Hero]], x</ref> Alex later apologized to Andrew for what happened, which is what Andrew wanted in the first place.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref> When they had to work together, Alex asked if they were cool and Andrew assured him that they were.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew was an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\nHe was chosen as the new [[Resident#Chief Resident|Chief Resident]] after there was a walkout of doctors in support of [[Meredith Grey]]. He decided to go to medical school after working as an EMT after high school. After a year as a surgical intern, he passed his intern exam and became a [[Resident|resident]]. Subsequently, he has been described by his superiors as one of the star residents of the hospital.\n\n\n*He played the guitar.\n*He said he had a lot of trouble getting to the second date because his first dates usually ended in sex and then women seemed to assume he had moved on.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n*Andrew didn't know baseball.\n*Andrew was Italian and spoke Italian, like [[Giacomo Gianniotti]] himself.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n*Andrew's given name is Andrea.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n*During his hospitalization for his assault, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] said his mother knew her and that she was probably at work. This is contradicted by later events that tell us his mother [[Lucia DeLuca]] has been dead since he was young. [[Krista Vernoff]] said it could be amended to be his stepmother.  \n*His favorite type of food was barbecue.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n*His favorite color was blue.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n*The Beatles were his favorite band.

They decided not to know the sexes of the babies. Laurie went into labor while her OB was on vacation, so [[Arizona Robbins]] stepped in to deliver the babies, but before delivery, she noticed something odd on the ultrasound. She had [[Alex Karev]] paged urgently and delivered the babies, who were both severely jaundiced. The babies were then taken to CT, where it was revealed that each of them had a large liver tumor.\n\nThe doctors informed Mason and Laurie of the situation and they decided to be tested to see if either of them was a match and could donate. Mason was a match, but Laurie was not, meaning they could only save one baby. They worried about how they would choose until Alex stepped in and said that they wouldn't have to choose; he'd be making the choice. He ran tests and compared their conditions, but the twins came out tied, so he decided that he needed to open both of them up and look directly at their tumors before he could make the choice. After the twins were opened, he evaluated each of them again and decided that Emma had a better chance, so she received the liver, while he tried resecting Daniel's tumor. Emma immediately started to improve after her surgery, but Daniel unfortunately died during his.\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Mason Kiefer]]. Together, they have two children.\n\n\nHer twin children, Emma and Daniel, were both born with aggressive liver tumors. Her husband matched as a donor, but was only able to give enough of his liver to save one. Emma received a portion of his liver and Daniel died.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kiefer, Laurie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}]}}}}
