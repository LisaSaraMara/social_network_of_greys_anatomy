She was taken to the ER, where she was only worried about Nisha and repeatedly claimed that she was fine. She'd had two previous heart transplants and said even if she died, she'd have far outlived what she should have. Her EKG was negative, so they ran more tests to figure out why she had passed out. The tests showed that her anti-rejection meds had caused her kidneys to fail and she'd need peritoneal dialysis until she could get a new kidney. She was taken in for a procedure to allow that. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\nThat night, Cece crashed, but was able to be resuscitated. They put her on amiodarone to improve her heart function and ran more tests. Her heart was barely pumping blood, so she had a heart biopsy, which showed congestive heart failure. They placed an internal defibrillator and she was put on the transplant list for a third time. When she learned that Nisha had died, she felt guilty and said she didn't want a new heart because she didn't want to live. Meredith talked to her and said she deserved to live and Nisha would want her to get a new heart. Also, Meredith wanted Cece to find her new love. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\nOn her eighth day of dialysis, Cece developed an infection in her peritoneum, meaning they couldn't use that for dialysis anymore. Since her other access sites were closed from prior surgeries, they searched for another way to get access. Meredith finally figured out they could due a translunar catheter and do dialysis through her back. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\nWhile she continued to wait, she furthered her matchmaking tendencies by trying to get up [[Casey Parker]] until he told her he already had a girlfriend, and talking to Maggie about her relationship with Jackson and her feelings about him suddenly leaving town. At the end of the day, she got Maggie to admit that she was upset about what Jackson had done and was too focused on other people to answer her own questions. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\nCece's condition continued to decline and she developed pleural effusions. She was taken for pleurocentesis, which relieved some of the pressure. During the wind storm, organs became available for Cece when [[Phoebe Moss]] was declared brain dead. She decided to go forward with the transplant despite the significant risks. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nCece was taken to the OR for surgery, but the power was knocked out by the wind storm, trapping Phoebe in the elevator. Cece realized something had gone wrong and her surgery was delayed because of it. When they finally got Phoebe out of the elevator, the transplant went forward as planned. Her heart was transplanted easily, but during her kidney transplant, she coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Andrew confessed his love to Meredith, she had a dream, which included Cece not feeling that Meredith kept her promise to find and accept love. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe said that she spent  years falling in love with straight women. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\n\nAfter hitting [[Nisha]] with her car, Cece refused to leave her side, wanting her to have someone to be with while she waited for her parents. She also promised to find Nisha love after she was recovered. When Nisha died, she was distraught and blamed herself.\n\n\nAfter Meredith hired Cece to find her love, Cece started asking Meredith questions about her life, which Meredith found frustrating and time-consuming.

The scan confirmed her pituitary tumor and also revealed a fractured vertebra in her spine. Despite this, Jade said she wanted to leave the hospital and didn't want anyone cutting into her brain. When Bailey insisted, Jade agreed to give them four hours to come up with a plan, but said her company was launching a new project in one week and she needed to be there for it.\n\n\nAfter the four hours were up, Jade tried to leave the hospital over the objections of the doctors. However, before she made it out the door, she collapsed, crushing [[Jo Wilson]], who also caught her head so it wouldn't hit the ground.

And you go from there.|'''[[Mark Sloan]]'''}}\n\n'''Mark Sloan''' was the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Plastic Surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. He is the father of [[Sloan Riley]] and [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]]. After his death, the hospital was renamed after him and [[Lexie Grey]], the two fatal casualties after the plane crash. \n\n\n\nMark was born in  to upper-class, but emotionally distant parents in [[New York|New York City]]. While working on a case involving a man's sleepwalking and his daughter's subsequent insomnia, Mark revealed that his own parents would often go out at night, leaving him to care for himself. As a result, he would turn on all the TVs and every light in the house, even those in the closets, but still couldn't sleep.\n\nLater, he revealed that he and [[Derek Shepherd]] were childhood friends and when Derek's mother, [[Carolyn Shepherd|Carolyn]], saw how lonely he was, she encouraged Derek to bring him home. This led Mark to develop a family relationship with the Shepherds, and become like a brother to Derek. When Derek's mother visited, she revealed that a -year-old Mark once put Derek's favorite frog into the microwave, to which Mark replied that he never pressed start.\n\nMark was an athlete in high school and played on the football team.\n\n\nShortly before Derek's move to Seattle, Mark and Addison were caught having sex in Derek's bedroom. According to Mark, Derek merely walked out, packed his things, and left. Derek later learned that they continued to see each other after he left. Part of the reason Mark moved to Seattle was to try to continue his relationship with Addison. Addison gave him an ultimatum: If he could go sixty days without sleeping with anyone else, she would consider dating him. However, when Mark saw Addison and [[Alex Karev]] coming out of an on-call room together, he realized that they had had sex, and lied to Addison that he had slept with someone to break the -day contract. He never revealed to Addison that he caught her.\n\n\nMark first visited Seattle to bring Addison back to New York. Shortly after arriving at Seattle Grace, Derek punched him, it is later revealed, while Meredith is cleaning his facial wound, that it was due to his even stronger feelings for Meredith rather than Addison.<ref>[[Yesterday]], x</ref>\uaMeredith and Mark only spoke to each other and Mark got punched,\uaMark and Addison had sex and Derek simply walked away and did not look back.\uaMark slept with Addison again before he intended to leave, but he stayed and became the Head of Plastic Surgery.\n\n\nMark was in the running for Chief of Surgery, along with Derek, Burke, and Addison. He got a idea from Bailey mentioning the hospital needs a \"right now\" plan, not a ten-year plan. Richard Webber told the other  that the board was eating up the \"right now\" plan, and suggested that they should do the same.<ref>[[My Favorite Mistake]], x</ref>\n\n\nMark had a sexual relationship with Callie Torres.<ref>[[What I Am]], x</ref><ref>[[Oh, the Guilt]], x</ref> Mark started flirting with Erica Hahn, which she rejected. Mark suggested having a threesome between him, Callie, and Erica. Erica said he would be intimidated by her and Callie's relationship, and kissed Callie before stepping off the elevator.<ref>[[Losing My Mind]], x</ref>\n\n\nMark and Lexie started their relationship off with Lexie going to his apartment, taking off her clothes and telling him to \"teach her.\" They then had sex. After that, Mark wanted to resist\uaLexie because of his promise to Derek but it proved futile. He and Callie tried to make a pact to not sleep with the hot surgical interns, but it falls through. At the end of the day Callie and Mark are side by side at the bar at Joe's. Mark decides he's going to pursue Lexie, but Callie still holds back from flirting with [[Sadie Harris]].\n\ua\nMark has reservations about Lexie's relative age and inexperience, but more so about breaking his promise to Derek. Especially when Derek is gearing up to propose to Meredith; Mark questions maybe breaking up with Lexie because\uahe can't sleep with any more of Derek's sisters.\n\nWhen Mark fractures his penis during sex, Lexie comforts him in the aftermath. Mark is initially humiliated and asks Lexie to leave, but after surgery they cuddle.\nLexie confronts Mark about keeping their relationship a secret. She's tired\uaof lying to the people close to her and says they need to go public.\ua\n\n\nDuring the hospital shooting, Mark and Lexie were at the nurses' station, where shots were fired by Gary Clark. Mark ran Lexie to the elevator, which had an unconscious and bloody Alex Karev in it. They brought Alex to a conference room, where they treated him until the SWAT team evacuated them.\n\n\nShortly after Arizona moved to Africa, Callie started sleeping with Mark. Callie got pregnant with Mark's baby and Mark decided he wanted to be part of this baby's life, because he didn't have the chance with his other daughter, Sloan. When Arizona came back to Seattle Grace Mercy West, she and Callie got into a car accident. Callie was badly injured. She had to have an emergency c-section at  weeks. She gave birth to a premature baby and named her Sofia. Sofia and Callie both survived. Mark helped raise Sofia with Callie and Arizona until his death.\n\n\nMark began dating an eye surgeon named Julia who worked at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]]. Once Lexie learned of this, she became jealous of their relationship. During a softball game, Julie began to taunt Lexie about her softball skills, causing Lexie to throw the softball at Julia, which injured\uaher.<ref>[[Put Me In, Coach]], x</ref>\n\nMark began taking an interest in Jackson because he wanted Jackson to choose plastic surgery as his specialty. Mark noted that Jackson was very good-looking like him, which is helpful in that field. Mark called the two of them the \"Plastics Posse.\"\n\n\nIn , while traveling to Boise, Idaho to perform a separation surgery of conjoined twins, Mark was in a [[Flight|plane crash]]. He, along with Meredith, Lexie, Cristina, Arizona, and Derek became stranded in the woods. Mark seemed to have escaped with only minor injuries at first, though after the death of Lexie, he became unresponsive. Cristina examined his chest to find major bruising. Cristina realized that he had a cardiac tamponade, fluid surrounding his heart. Meredith used a tube from a bottle that Derek and Cristina found to drain the fluid. Cristina, Meredith, and Derek were able to get Mark to the front of the plane where Arizona and the pilot were. Mark woke up and told Arizona that Lexie was dead, and that she was waiting for him. Mark tried to tell Arizona he would be okay when he died, but she told him that she, Sofia, and Callie were waiting for him, too.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nMark was airlifted to Idaho, then sedated and moved to Seattle Grace Mercy West. He spent two months declining until he woke up briefly. After that day, he fell into a coma. After thirty days, they turned the life support machines off and Derek and Callie sat with him while he died.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n\nDay of the Dead\nMark was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith's Beach\nDuring Meredith's COVID-induced coma, Mark appeared on her 'beach', alongside Lexie.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:Old-friends-again.jpg|thumb|left|px|Best friends.]]His friendship with Derek lasted throughout childhood and into their adult years and Mark was Derek's best man at his wedding to [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. He once joked that Derek is his \"better half, but not better looking half\". Their friendship was strained due to Addison's affair with Mark and the latter's relationship with [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]]. They are polar opposite personalities: Mark is usually happy-go-lucky and forgives Derek easily while Derek tends to brood and hold grudges.\n\nAs Derek and Addison's marriage became strained, Mark and Addison grew closer, and eventually Mark slept with Addison, only for Derek to catch them in the act. Derek subsequently left New York and later Addison followed suit, leaving Mark behind. He moved to Seattle to try to win them both back and in the end, he became good friends with both.\n\nAccording to his \"-dollar-an-hour shrink\", \"behind his rugged and confident exterior, he is self-destructive and self-loathing to an almost pathological degree.\" Mark has commitment issues, likely stemming from his emotionally challenged relationship with his parents, and his friendship with Derek was his single longest non-sexual relationship. He has a long history of womanizing and one-night stands, and is somewhat indiscriminate about his partners, admitting to affairs with not only Addison but also his tennis partner's wife. He has also slept with all of Derek's sisters at some point. However he generally keeps a distance from [[Meredith Grey]] out of respect for Derek, once even comforting her following her first break-up with Derek by telling her that they're now both members of the \"Dirty Mistresses\" club.\n\nMark is impatient and shows disdain for the responsibility of training interns, and \"berates and humiliates\", as described by [[Erica Hahn]]. He often had interns pick up his dry cleaning or get him coffee and mainly looked out for himself, ignoring Addison when she told him SGH was a teaching hospital. He is also intelligent and conniving, and not above using others to advance his own agenda.\n\n[[File:hugging.jpg|thumb|right|px|Mark congratulates Derek.]]\n\nMark first appeared in Seattle shortly after the bomb scare at the hospital with the sole intention of bringing Addison back to New York. During this visit, Meredith, Cristina, and Izzie discussed a nickname for Mark. They came up with such names as \"McSexy\" and \"McYummy\". Meredith was the one who came up with the name \"[[\"Mc\" Labeling|McSteamy]]\". From that moment on, the interns regularly used the nickname behind Sloan's back. He eventually found out about the nickname when Meredith, who was under the influence of painkillers, called to him ''\"McSteamy! Woo hoo!\"'' to which he replied, ''\"Is that what you're calling me now? McSteamy?\" ''She responded by saying, ''\"Yeah, but I don't think you're supposed to know that.\"''\n\nAddison rejected Mark's offer to bring her back to New York and Derek rejected his apology, leaving Mark to return empty-handed to New York.\n\nUpon his return, he was not warmly welcomed by Addison or Derek, although he desperately wanted to repair his relationships with both. He carried on a brief fling with [[Callie Torres]] before she reconciled with [[George O'Malley]], and developed a friendship with Meredith, although he hit on her before she and Derek resumed their relationship. Mark disliked Seattle, annoyed by the weather and the perceived inadequacies of the city in comparison to Manhattan, and was also discouraged by the continued strife among himself, Derek, and Addison.\n\nMark\us focus remains on repairing his relationships with Addison and Derek. In an effort to stray from the sexual nature of their past attempts, Mark entered a sixty-day abstinence pact with Addison with the agreement that if at the end of two months\u time they had remained celibate, Addison would agree to give a relationship with Mark another chance. However, thirty-two days into the pact, Mark witnessed Addison and Alex leaving an on-call room together, and realized what had happened between them. Hurt, he lied to Addison about breaking the pact. Mark and Derek remained estranged, but their relationship greatly mended, after Mark showed support and strength, while Meredith was fighting for her life.<ref>[[Some Kind of Miracle]], x</ref> After Addison left for Los Angeles, Mark and Derek have mended their relationship, and although the subject of Mark's infidelity is occasionally brought up, they have shown mutual respect for each other, and their respective surgical skills.\n\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Mark and Addison.]]\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nAddison, Mark and Derek were best friends. However, Addison felt that Derek was absent at home, and therefore slept with Mark, supposedly as a way of getting attention. After catching them in the act, Derek left New York for Seattle.\n\nAfter Derek declared his marriage to Addison and friendship with Mark over and left town, Mark and Addison lived together for two months. During this time, Addison became pregnant with Mark's baby. He was initially excited about the pregnancy, but Addison had an abortion after discovering that Mark had cheated on her and after a call from Richard Webber she left Mark to follow Derek to Seattle. Mark, however, remained sensitive to the date of Addison's abortion, but later admitted that he was not ready to become a father, and probably wouldn't have made a very good one at the time.\n\nLater, Mark followed them to Seattle to win them both back and tried to convince Addison that he loved her and her marriage was over because Derek was in love with Meredith. He went home without Addison, but after Addison found Meredith's panties in Derek's tuxedo, she called Mark for a \"transcontinental booty-call\". Derek came to apologize to Addison and found Mark coming out of the shower, at which point both Addison and Derek knew their marriage was over. After a quick trip back to New York to sublet his apartment and sell his practice, Mark took over the plastics program at Seattle Grace.\n\nMark tried to prove himself to Addison by abstaining from sex for sixty days. After discovering that Addison slept with Alex, Mark lied and said that he had slept with someone, thereby taking responsibility, and effectively ending their romance. They did, however, remain friends.\ua\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Mark and Lexie]]\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nMark decided to change his ways after the nurses started a campaign called ''Nurses against Mark Sloan'' and Miranda Bailey's defense was \"''He's a manwhore''\". He was single for a substantial amount of time, occasionally sleeping with Callie. Meredith started to worry that Mark was flirting with [[Lexie Grey]]. Derek told Mark to \"''keep little Sloan out of little Grey''\". However, Mark started to notice her and they began dating secretly with only Callie, Sadie, and Derek's mother aware of their relationship. When Addison came back to Seattle for a visit, she realized but Mark managed to keep her quiet. Their relationship continued, even after Lexie gave him a fractured penis.\n\nLexie soon grew tired of keeping secrets and told him she wasn't going to be his girlfriend until he told Derek. He confessed to Derek who eventually accepted it. Their relationship continued but things got awkward when Mark suggested they move in together, the subject moved to marriage and awkwardly they started to avoid each other. Mark decided to move on anyway and started looking for a house but Lexie told him he couldn't make her feel guilty.\n\nSometime after George O'Malley's death they moved in together. Later, however, Mark discovered he had a daughter, [[Sloan Riley]], who arrives seeking his support after becoming pregnant and being evicted by her mother. Mark permits her to move in with him, which angers Lexie. When Lexie makes it clear that she knew that Mark would choose his own daughter over her, she puts an end to their relationship. Sloan experiences difficulties in her pregnancy, so Mark takes her to LA to be treated. He and Addison once again sleep together, but when he comes back he tells Lexie because he doesn't want to lie to her and wants them to get back together, but when she tells him she slept with [[Alex Karev|Alex]], it puts an end to their relationship.\n\nDuring the hospital shooting, Mark helped Lexie save Alex, her new boyfriend. In the aftermath of the shooting, Lexie had a psychiatric episode and Mark had her committed to the psychiatric unit. Their friendship was strained. However, Lexie softened towards him when she learned that he was still in love with her. As Lexie went to talk to Mark about him still being in love with her, she saw Mark entering his apartment with Derek's sister [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], kissing her and ultimately having sex with her. When Callie's girlfriend, pediatric surgeon [[Arizona Robbins]], broke up with her, she and Mark had a drunken one-night-stand.\n\nShortly thereafter, he reconciled with Lexie, and the two got back together. Callie discovered she was pregnant with his child, and Mark was delighted, although he was conflicted because he knew Lexie did not want a child. When Mark revealed the news, she was ultimately dismayed and left Mark.\n\nAfter [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] and Lexie got into a relationship, initially Mark was jealous. He later gave them his blessing and told Lexie he would let her go. Lexie replied that she still loved him, but right now she needed Jackson to be happy. Mark only repeated that he would let her go.\n\nWhen Mark finally started dating again, Lexie was jealous. This even resulted in Lexie throwing a ball at Mark's [[Julia Canner|new girlfriend]] and mistakenly saying that she wished she could be in the OR with him when he was talking to his girlfriend on the phone.\n\nLater, Lexie finally told Mark that she was still in love with him. Mark told Derek that he was torn between Lexie, the woman he loved but who didn't want anything that he wanted, and [[Julia Canner|Julia]], who could give him everything he wanted. Mark and Lexie boarded the plane to Idaho with their feelings unresolved. After the plane crashed, Lexie was stuck under debris from the plane. Mark told Lexie that he loved her and that they were going to get married and have children, because they were meant to be. Lexie then died with a smile on her face. Mark broke down and held her hand for several hours after. He later suffered from a cardiac tamponade, which [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] (with [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]'s help) was able to resolve temporarily with some personal items that survived the crash. He fought for his life throughout the rest of their time in the woods, though he considered letting himself die, saying that he'll, \"''be okay. Lexie is waiting for [him].''\" Arizona reminded him that [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] was waiting for him to return home and that he had to survive for her sake.\n\nAfter they were rescued, Julia came to the hospital. She told him that she loved him, but he replied that he loved Lexie, therefore ending their relationship. Mark spent two months fighting to recover before falling into a coma.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nCallie and Derek watched over him. Before falling into a coma, Mark had signed paperwork stating that he wanted to be removed from life support if there were no signs of improvement after  days. When that time came, they took him off life support and he died.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nAfter Mark and Lexie's relationship fell apart, he began a sexual relationship with cardiothoracic surgeon [[Teddy Altman]], despite the fact she was in love with their SGH's [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]], [[Owen Hunt]]. They had a few weeks of dating, which seemed to be going well. Mark later slept with [[Reed Adamson]], as he and Teddy were not exclusively dating. There was no official breakup but they both stopped seeing each other.\n\n[[Julia Canner]]\nAfter Lexie and Mark's breakup and [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia's]]\uabirth, Mark hit a dry spell for a little while. He was so focused on being a new father that he didn't actively pursue romance. After he picked up an obsession with cooking,\ua[[Callie Torres|Callie]]\uasuggested that he find a new girlfriend. Julia works at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] and was part of the softball game between the two hospitals. She and Mark dated for several months, however it was quite obvious Mark was still not over Lexie, especially when she and Jackson broke up. In spite of this, Mark and Julia were quite serious.\uaThey even discussed having a child together. However, before that could happen, Lexie professed her love for Mark. Shortly after, Mark and Lexie\ua[[Flight|were in a plane crash]], in which Lexie died from her injuries, leaving Mark devastated. When Julia visited him in the hospital after the crash, he broke up with her, saying that he loved\ua[[Lexie Grey|Lexie]].\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nWhen Amelia came to Seattle to make good with her brother after he was shot, she slept with Mark Sloan the day before she left.\n\n\nMark attended medical school at [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], completed his residency in [[otolaryngology]], a fellowship in plastic surgery, and quickly became one of the most highly-regarded [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgeons]] on the East Coast with a thriving private practice.\n\nDuring a surgery with Mark Sloan, [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Erica Hahn]] commented on a technique that he was performing. Instead of using wires, he was using cables to repair his patient. He said that he learned this \"Tension banding\" technique back in New York after Columbia, when he studied under [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Crash Into Me, Part |John Seever]].<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref> \n\nProfessionally, Mark was regarded as a very successful and renowned surgeon and one of New York's finest plastic surgeons. [[Alex Karev]] referred to him as the \"go-to-guy\" for plastics on the East Coast, and Richard Webber proposed that the addition of Mark to Seattle Grace's plastics program would double the revenue of other departments. He is skilled at delicate and complex reconstructive procedures, but also performs cosmetic procedures. Of his personal philosophy, he says: \"People don't come to me to fix what's on the outside. They come to me to fix what's on the inside.\"\n\nBefore moving to Seattle, he owned a private practice with Addison Montgomery and Derek Shepherd. However, when they moved away he decided to win them back and sold the practice.\n\nAfter some time working at SGH, he considered terminating his verbal contract with Richard and moving back to sunny New York but he decided to stay after Meredith let it slip that Richard was retiring. Mark entered the race for the chief position and quickly gained the advantage when the others prepared ten year plans and he prepared a right-now plan (taking the words from Bailey). The board members and the chief applauded him, but in the end he failed to become chief. However, he stayed at Seattle Grace to work on his relationship with Derek and Seattle itself started to appeal to him too.\n\nMark began to take an interest in mentoring [[Jackson Avery]]. Derek surmised that his \"sudden interest in education\" was a result of him not being in a sexual relationship at that time. Jackson had initially been interested in neurosurgery, but later switched to plastics, much to his [[Catherine Fox|mother's]] chagrin. After Mark's death, Jackson took over their work.\n\n\n*To French viewers, Mark is known as Dr. Glamour, not McSteamy. To German viewers, he is known as McTraumprinz (Traumprinz roughly means \"Dream Prince\") or McSexy, and to Swedish viewers, he is known as Dr. Hot. In the Italian version, he is called Dr. Bollore (which means hot). In the Czech version, viewers know him as Mc\udhav\ufd (which also means hot). In Brazil, he's known as Gostos\ueo (which means super hot). In Finland, he's known as Kuumatohtori (which means hot doctor).\n*He didn't think arena football was real football.\n*His choice of coffee was a bone dry cappuccino.\n*He was not opposed to physician-assisted suicide.<ref>[[Suicide is Painless]], x</ref>\n*He shared his first and last name with the character Dick van Dyke played on \"Diagnosis: Murder\".\n*He had Chicken Pox when he was six.\n*Mark was \"[[Board Certification|double-board certified]]\" in [[Board Certification#American Board of Otolaryngology|ENT]] and [[Board Certification#American Board of Plastic Surgery|plastics]].\n**In the real world, this would mean that Mark had completed a five year residency in [[Otolaryngology]] and then a six year residency in [[Plastic Surgery]] because facial reconstructive surgery exists as a fellowship of [[Otolaryngology]], and not the other way around.\n*Mark was the interim [[Chief of Surgery|chief of surgery]] during [[Support System]].\n*He put [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] frog in the microwave when he was ten, but never turned it on.\n*He started to learn Spanish so that [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] could grow up knowing her heritage and culture.\n*He was on his high school football team.\n*He thought surprise parties were too hostile.\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nMarkSloan.png\nMarkSloan.png\nxMarkSloan.png\nxMarkSloan.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Mark-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Yesterday]]\n*[[In the Midnight Hour]]\n*[[Flight]]\n*[[Going, Going, Gone]]\n*[[Remember the Time]]\n\n\n:'''Mark:''' I love you.

Shepherd went against the orders of the Chief and decided to operate.\n\n\nIsaac came to [[Derek Shepherd]] with a set of scans. He said they were for consult. The scans showed a large spinal tumor. After Derek talked to Isaac about the scans for a few minutes, Isaac confessed that the scans were his and he was the one who had the tumor. Despite Derek believing the only way to remove it was by cutting the spinal cord and paralyzing him, Isaac asked Derek to try to remove it. Other doctors had dismissed the pain as other things, so he ran an MRI on himself, which showed the tumor. He'd done a lot of research on neurosurgeons and knew that Derek took the most risks.\n\nDerek got fresh scans and thought about it. [[Richard Webber]] told Derek he couldn't operate. However, Derek went behind his back and auditioned the residents to find someone naturally gifted in microsurgery. [[Jackson Avery]] won a spot on the OR team. Before his surgery, Isaac told Derek to cut the cord if he needed to, because he could survive the loss of his legs.\n\nDerek took him into surgery, where he opened and spent several hours just looking at the tumor. He spent over  hours looking at the spine without making a single cut before finally closing when Richard came in and demanded it.\n\nHe told Isaac that there wasn't any way to remove the tumor without risking his life and he wouldn't cut the cord while Isaac still had use of his legs. Isaac insisted that they would try again the next day. Derek said he couldn't try again, but Isaac told him to go home and sleep on it. Derek went home and drew a picture of the tumor on his bedroom wall and talked through it with Meredith.\n\nThe next day, he told Richard he would be cutting the cord to remove the tumor, but he instead started to remove the tumor just by picking a place and starting to cut. He got to a place where he didn't know which vessel fed the cord and which fed the tumor. He decided to come back to it at the end. He got to the end and had to make a cut.\n\nIsaac woke up after surgery and was upset because he could move his toes, thinking it meant that Derek hadn't removed the tumor. Derek informed him that he'd removed the whole tumor and Isaac was going to be okay.\n\n\n\nHe was married. His wife starved to death while in a refugee camp.\n\n\nHis parents, brothers, and sisters are dead.\n\nHis child starved to death while in a refugee camp.\n\n\nIsaac is very popular among the doctors at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n\nIsaac is a radiology tech at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n\n*English is not his first language.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Isaac}}\n\n[[de:Isaac]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Support Staff]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He tried to run up to the choir loft, presumably to warn his girlfriend, [[Astrid]], the choir director, but he fell down two flights of stairs and had to be taken to the hospital. In the ER, they did an ultrasound of his belly and then ordered a CT, which revealed bleeding near his kidney. [[Amelia Shepherd]] consulted and said he had a mild concussion, but she cleared him for surgery.

After a thorough examination, doctors at Seattle Grace quickly realized that either Tom or Bonnie would have to be removed from the pole to allow the other person to live. Bonnie's injuries were very bad, including a severed spinal column and shredded aorta, leading doctors to decide that Bonnie needed to be moved off of the pole. When doctors approached Tom and Bonnie of their decision Tom was reluctant because he felt that it was unfair for them to choose his life over hers. Eventually Bonnie was able to convince Tom that it was fine she be moved off because he had a better chance of survival. When Tom and Bonnie arrived in the operating room Bonnie asked Tom if he believed in heaven, Tom comforted her by saying that he did.

He told her he worked at a free clinic and recommended that she get the rash checked out.\n\n\nLater that day, Veronica came to the clinic and Alex examined her. In addition to the rash, he also noticed yellow in the whites of her eyes, indicating jaundice, and she noted that she'd lost weight despite being sixteen weeks pregnant. Suspecting that she had pancreatic cancer, Alex insisted that she get a surgical consult from Bailey. Bailey ran tests and confirmed Alex's suspicions. She had advanced pancreatic cancer and needed to start treatment immediately.\n\nVeronica was told that Bailey recommended termination so she could start chemotherapy the next day. Veronica resisted, because even with treatment, she only had less than a year to live. However, without treatment, she wouldn't live long enough to have a healthy baby. Alex suggested a Whipple, which would remove the bulk of the tumor, which could buy her enough time to deliver a healthy baby. Bailey refused, but when Veronica talked to her about seeing images of the baby growing up with Jeremy and not seeing those when she went the way Bailey was suggesting, Bailey agreed to do the surgery.\n\nThe surgery went well and they hoped it would buy her enough time. However, she was still terminal herself. ''(\"[[Roar]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she was  weeks and  days pregnant, Veronica came back to the hospital with back pain, which she'd had for a week. An MRI showed that the cancer had spread to her spine and she needed to have a c-section that day. Before her surgery, she signed a DNR. Arizona easily delivered her baby, but she developed a clot that went to her lung and she struggled to breathe after the delivery. They said she could rescind her DNR, but she said she was tired and so they just stayed with her while she died. After she was gone, Alex told Jeremy about her death and he cried. ''(\"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe and [[Jeremy]] have a son together.\n\n\nShe and Jeremy met as children and became friends. Their friendship remained into adulthood, when they made a pact to have a baby together at age  if they were still single then. When the time came, the learned it would be expensive. However, a drunken night led to them conceiving a child together. ''(\"[[Roar]]\")''\n\nAs she was dying, she admitted that she loved Jeremy and had never told him that. She asked Amelia to tell him not to look back and to be brave for their son.

''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nMegan told Steve that Henry, presumably another intern, was observing in [[Tricia Hale|Tricia Hale's]] surgery when Mark Sloan announced to the whole OR that [[Izzie Stevens]] and [[George O'Malley]] had broken up. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nLucy and Meredith's other interns worked on Meredith and Derek's tumor trial. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\nThey later had to organize and collate trial patients. Meredith threatened them with scut if they missed a paper. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural to practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nLeo, Sadie, and Megan all had to work with Izzie in the clinic for a day. When they did procedures on patients, she also had them perform them on her. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nMegan found out that she was pregnant after sleeping with Steve while on a break with Pierce. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nMegan was affected by George's death. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program.\n\nCristina had Pierce, Megan, and Leo spy on the Chief for her and report back what they saw. Megan was ultimately fired as part of the first round of layoffs. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nAfter she was fired, she filed a lawsuit against the hospital, claiming they fired her because she was pregnant. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nMegan agreed to participate in a documentary someone was making about the doctors at the hospital only because she expected to get paid for it. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to give her a fresh start, [[Derek Shepherd]] re-hired Megan when he was appointed Chief. ''(\"[[State of Love and Trust]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Pierce Halley]]\nPierce was dating Megan at some point, but they broke up when Megan found a nurse's phone number in his scrubs. During their break, Megan slept with [[Steve Mostow|Steve]] and Steve accidentally sent an email to people about their hookup, including Pierce. According to [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]], Pierce wanted to kill Steve. Pierce fought him leaving Steve with a bloody hand, almost broken and himself with a black eye. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n[[Steve Mostow]]\nLater, Megan and Steve were married by Steve's uncle, with Graciella as a witness. On New Year's Eve, Pierce demanded that Megan get a paternity test, claiming that he could be the father. She was conflicted over the test, fearing that if the baby was Pierce's, Steve would be devastated. But even when the results confirmed the father was Steve, he divorced her. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nOriginally one of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] [[Internship|interns]], Megan became a [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She wanted to become a [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgeon]].\n\nDuring the merger of Settle Grace and Mercy West, she was cut from the program. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")'' After being fired, by email, she decided to sue the hospital for wrongful termination, claiming they fired her due to her pregnancy. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Derek Shepherd]] became [[Chief of Surgery]], he hired Megan back, telling her that even if there would be other cutbacks, he wanted to give her another chance to prove her value as a doctor.\n\n\n*After Megan was hired back after the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]], she was never seen or mentioned again.\n*She took piano lessons.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n*She and Steve lived at  Wentworth Street when they were married.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n*She would like to see Disneyland in Paris.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n*She hates surprises.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nInternMegan.png|[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Let the Truth Sting]]\nInternsLucyandMegan.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Forever Young]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Piece of My Heart]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Freedom, Part ]]\nInternsLucyandMegan.png|[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]\nInterns.png|[[Here Comes the Flood]]\nInternsMeganandDani.png|[[Brave New World]]\nInternsLisaandMegan.png|[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Life During Wartime]]\nInternMegan.png|[[In the Midnight Hour]]\nInterns.png|[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\nInterns.png|[[Before and After]]\nInternMegan.png|[[An Honest Mistake]]\nInternMegan.png|[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Stand By Me]]\nInternsPierceRyanandMegan.png|[[Elevator Love Letter]]\nxMeganGraciella.png|[[Good Mourning]]\nxMeganMostow.png|[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\nxMeganMostow.png|[[State of Love and Trust]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Megan Nowland Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Megan Nowland]]\n[[de:Megan Nowland]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nowland, Megan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Webisode Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He determined that she had made the right choice and thanked her. ''(\"[[Second Opinion]]\")''\n\n\nDerek and April put together a plan to make budgets cuts in every department. April tried to convince him to look into it, but he refused as he wasn't interested in making cuts in his department.\n\nLater, Derek tried to convince him as well. At first, he wasn't willing to listen to Derek either, but when Derek mentioned Jeff's sister, whose aneurysm he clipped, and how grateful Jeff was after that, Jeff reluctantly agreed to hear it. He said he had one condition: he thought his parking spot too small and asked to have Derek's, which was right next to his, so he could park in the middle. ''(\"[[Bad Blood]]\")''\n\n\nJeff Russell was doing cardio research and invited Cristina Yang to work with him. She was glad to finally be able to do surgery again, after having dealt with the paperwork that comes with owning a hospital. However, when he later asked her for $ million for his research, it turned he only wanted to work with her because she could give him the money, as she sat on the board.\n\nCristina was angry because she felt like she was being used, and then cut his budget.

When she was faced with deportation to El Salvador, she moved to Switzerland to work at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]].\n\n\n\nSam was born in El Salvador. A war broke out and her father was shot on their front porch, after which her mother took Sam and her sister out of the country. They moved to Florida and her mother worked  jobs  hours a day to keep them safe. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\nSam came to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for an interview to be considered for an internship. In her interview, she said she'd read all about the fire and [[Stephanie Edwards]] was her hero. She didn't realize they'd already done the remodel of the hospital. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nSam attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. In the hallway, Sam was shocked to see Andrew and learn that he worked there. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a roller coaster derailed at a fair, Sam came to Ben because she needed supplies for a burn patient in the clinic. He had Andrew show her where central supply was, not knowing their history. They ended up having sex in the skills lab and were caught by Bailey and Webber. He later came into the on-call room where she was resting and despite them agreeing that they were bad for each other, they had sex again. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the heart monitors started malfunctioning in the ER, Sam stepped in to defibrillate, not knowing the patient was simply sleeping. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nSuffering from a lack of sleep, Sam then started to cause patients to panic in the ER. Richard told Andrew to stay with her and supervise her. Andrew ended up telling her not to talk to anymore patients until she got some sleep. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nAfter overhearing Amelia ask Andrew to figure out which of the new interns had written a paper on pupillary response in comatose patients, Sam told Amelia it was her and was invited to join her team, along with Andrew. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nSam and Andrew both continued working on Team Shepherd, torturing both of them, as they had agreed they shouldn't have sex anymore. Despite this, they tortured each other as they worked, each of them turning the other on. They did this while they worked on a proposal for a surgical innovation to save [[Kimmie Park]]. Their proposal, under Alex and Amelia, was submitted for consideration for the surgical contest, but was not selected. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nDespite not getting the funding, they continued to work hard to figure out a way to save Kimmie. Amelia brought in [[Tom Koracick]] to help them and they tested over and over again, but had no success. Koracick wanted to give up trying to find a solution in time for Kimmie, but during a fight, he had an epiphany and they tried another method, which had greater success. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\nThey use the guided laser treatment on Noah and it worked, but also showed them they didn't have enough time to hone the procedure to work for Kimmie. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Andrew was concussed in the ER, Sam worried about him. When Amelia caught wind of this, she encouraged Sam to tell Andrew she was in love with him. Sam went to Andrew, but Andrew stopped her and said they were young before, but now they're not and they confessed their mutual love. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done.

They toyed with having her flee, but fleeing would make her a criminal and not let her practice medicine ever again, so they dismissed that chance. Pressed for time, Meredith contacted [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] and got Sam a job at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] working for her and gave Sam all the documentation she needed to show that she had plans to leave the country, including an essay she'd written as part of her application to work there. Then she got a cab from the hospital to the airport. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nShe and Andrew had a relationship in the past. Realizing they weren't good for one another, things ended badly. As she refused to answer his calls, he kidnapped her dog and she then broke into his apartment to retrieve it. He then moved across the country without saying goodbye to her, leading to her blocking him on social media. They hadn't seen each since then until they bumped into one another at Grey Sloan Memorial, where Sam had just started her residency.\n\nHe initially ignored her because they always wreck each other and because he thought she followed him to Seattle, but she made it clear it was pure coincidence. After ending up in the same on-call room, they ignored the toxicity of their relationship and ended up having sex, something they continued to do every chance they got.\n\nAfter Andrew was injured in the ER, he and Sam confessed their love to each other and agreed to start again. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nWhen she learned that Andrew was living in an on-call room, she asked him to come live with her.

She was airlifted from [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] so the doctors could try to make a plan to remove her tumor. The tumor was large and wrapped around several of her organs. Meredith used [[Anatomy Jane]] to explain the tumor to Tori and her family.\n\nHer grandmother then insisted that [[Erica Hahn]] be on the team, because Dr. Stewart had told them that she was the best cardiovascular surgeon. Erica wasn't optimistic about Tori's chances for survival, because three other hospitals had turned them away. Despite this, she joined the team and they started discussing options. Meredith suggested that they take out the organs that were involved in the blood supply in order to resect the tumor. They needed to figure out a way to give them the time they needed to do that. They decided to take the organs out and put them on ice while they cut out the tumor.\n\nThey took Tori into surgery and started resecting the tumor. They hit a wall when they didn't have enough tissue to re-attach the organs. They agreed to use human umbilical vein to bridge the gap. Once they were done, they were able to reconnect the organs and close. She was stable after surgery.\n\n\n\nThe Beglers are a very close family.

They decided they'd take him, but Owen said as he was Leo's legal guardian, he'd be fighting them. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, Leo and his sister, Allison, were left in the care of their grandmother as both their parents were working at the hospital with COVID patients. During this time, Leo occasionally FaceTimed with Teddy and Owen. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")'' He and his grandma made up a game during this time in which she wrapped him with pillows and he pretended he was sleeping on a cloud. ''(\"[[In My Life]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, Leo, Allison, and Scout all had a play date together with Teddy and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, Owen came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted.\n\n\nIn April , Leo attended Maggie and Winston's wedding with Teddy and Owen. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nLeo came to the park with Teddy and Owen on the day they were meant to get married. The wedding was interrupted by a bicycle accident, but they later got married at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nOne day, when Owen and Teddy were arriving at work, Teddy said she'd take the kids to daycare while Owen went to work, so Owen picked up Leo to say goodbye to his little cowboy. Leo corrected that they're a girl, but Teddy told Leo that they were a boy. After some discussion, Teddy and Owen decided to seek therapy for themselves so they were better prepared to help Leo. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\nTeddy and Owen spoke to [[Robin (I'll Cover You)|Robin]] about Leo and she said that they needed to look for insistent, consistent, and persistent signs from Leo and until then, to let him explore his gender. For now, there was no need to change his name, clothes, or pronouns. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[John (Out for Blood)|John]] reported Owen for stealing drugs from the hospital to euthanize terminally ill soldiers, the whole family was force to flee Seattle suddenly. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\n\nLeo's birth father is a drug dealer. His birth mother became addicted to drugs after receiving opioids for an ACL repair. She ran away from her parents, who did not know about her pregnancy. Leo was fostered by [[Owen Hunt]] until the birth mother's parents found out about Leo's existence. They wanted to raise Leo but soon came to realize they had to focus on their daughter and let her be a child. The family then agreed to let Owen and Amelia adopt Leo.

However, he suffered a spontaneous intestinal perforation and had to be taken right back into surgery. [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] operated to repair his intestines. The surgery was successful and he was taken from there to the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]], where his condition was stable. He also had a patent ductus arteriosis, which they treated with indomethacin. ''(\"[[Have You Seen Me Lately?]]\")''\n\n\nNot long after he was born, Tommy developed NEC and needed abdominal surgery. He was taken into surgery, where Arizona determined that only a small portion of his bowel was necrotic, so there was more than enough to salvage. While they were operating, Tommy went into cardiogenic shock.\n\nAfter surgery, Arizona informed his parents that he was in congestive heart failure. As she listed their treatment options, Chris shot each one down, stating the risks of each one. Arizona asked them how aggressive they wanted to be with their treatment. Morgan wanted to be more aggressive, but Chris wanted to stop.\n\nThey started treatment and Morgan was advised that it could be hard to watch, but since Chris had left, she decided to stay. She was upset when the treatment was started, but she stayed with him. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\nTommy later developed a small brain bleed, which they monitored. Teddy also told Morgan that Tommy had a pericardial tumor, which had to be removed that day as it was compressing his heart. Callie informed Morgan that Tommy's hip displasia could be treated with a harness.\n\nWhile he was in surgery for his heart, his brain bleed worsened to stage III, requiring surgery. The surgery was successful and he was left stable in the NICU. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\nLater, Tommy went into sepsis due to an ileocolic fistula. He had also developed post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and had retinopathy of prematurity. Arizona listed the things Tommy was at risk for and asked Morgan if she still wanted to proceed with the surgery or if she wanted to allow natural death. Morgan was convinced that they weren't there yet. Despite Arizona saying that things were deteriorating significantly and that Morgan needed to consider what kind of life she wanted for her son, Morgan decided to go ahead with the surgery.

Arizona was reluctant to operate, but Morgan insisted, so she took him into surgery, but once she was in there, she saw that almost all of his bowel was necrotic, so she closed.

This attitude came to light when Alex took her for a [[Computed Tomography|CT]] scan and left the microphone on, allowing Annie to hear him bad mouthing her to the technician. It was only when George asked her why she let it get that bad that she revealed that every time someone she loved went into hospital, they did not come out alive.\n\nKnowing that she would die unless the tumor was removed, she consented. Once in the OR, it was planned that Burke would work to remove the section of tumor attached to the front of her body and once he had finished, she would be rolled onto her back and Derek would remove what was attached to her spine. Cristina and George were assigned the exhausting task of holding up the tumor during surgery. George angered Burke when an itch caused him to lose his grip. Miranda Bailey commented that some of the blood vessels in the tumor were as thick as human thumbs.\n\nAfter Burke was called away to an emergency, Derek took over.

Cristina took her to the OR for a biopsy, which revealed that she was rejecting her donor heart. They treated it with anti-rejection medication and put Ivy back on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well.

She was taken into surgery to insert an LVAD and then she was put on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nFrankie's LVAD failed to reverse the heart damage, which left her in desperate need of a heart. One became available, but when they transplanted it, they discovered that it had been damaged during retrieval and couldn't keep her alive. When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow.

They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up.

After Dr. Davies finished, Dr. Burke finished by performing the close. Unfortunately, Dr. Burke had erroneously left a surgical towel within Mrs. Drake's thoracic cavity. The incident went unreported as Dr. Burke feared that it would cause irreparable damage to his cardiothoracic surgical career.\n\nSoon after, Mrs. Drake overcame her habit and quit smoking cold-turkey. However, in the next five years, she still suffered discomfort and had to resign from her restaurant job.\n\n\nMrs. Drake returned to Seattle Grace Hospital five years later to surgically relieve the pressure in her lungs.

Dr. Webber noted this was her second visit and advised both Dr. Bailey and Dr. O'Malley to refrain from the anti-smoking lecture. However, during Mrs. Drake pre-operative prep, Dr. O'Malley mentioned to her that it would have been a good idea to stop smoking. Mrs. Drake then informed Dr. O'Malley that she did indeed quit, but the discomfort continued. It was this conversation that Mrs. Drake became fond of Dr. O'Malley.\n\nDuring her laprascopic procedure, both Dr. Webber and Dr. Bailey discovered the surgical towel in an attempt to cut the bullae, and immediately converted to an open thoracotomy to extract the towel. Once removed, Dr. Webber assumed that the towel came from her initial surgery at Seattle Grace. Dr. Webber soon tasked Dr. Bailey to spearhead the investigation as to how this could have occurred, while he had the conversation with Mrs. Drake regarding her post-operative condition.\n\nDr. Bailey assigned fellow surgical intern [[Cristina Yang]] to look into the post-operative reports to identify the doctors involved with the initial surgery. Given Mrs. Drake fondness of Dr. O'Malley, Dr. Bailey assigned him to pacify Mrs. Drake to mitigate the potential lawsuit. Dr. Yang soon discovered that Dr. Burke was the surgical fellow assigned to the case at the time and had performed the closing procedure. She immediately shared these results with Dr. Bailey, who then approached Dr. Burke about this matter.\n\nDuring an unrelated case, Dr. Burke admitted to his carelessness to Chief Webber and the hospital's legal counsel and then personally apologized to Mrs. Drake.\n\n\n*According to [[Richard Webber]], Mrs. Drake was treated at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] in ; however, when Cristina examines the post-operative report from Mrs. Drake's surgery, the date shown is --.\n*Although her first procedure was performed by [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeons]], Mrs. Drake's second procedure, still involving the thoracic region of the body, was performed by [[Richard Webber|Dr. Webber]] and [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Bailey]], both of whom are [[General Surgery|general surgeons]].\n*One of her original doctors was named [[Angela Whiting]], the same as the show's property master.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drake, Stephanie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

In oncology, when a normal cell changes into something malignant, it's called cellular transformation. The damn cells turn toxic right in front of your eyes. So as far as I'm concerned transformation sucks. Change is a funny thing, and not everyone can handle it. It can sneak up on you. Things aren't what they used to be. Your whole world has transformed. You realize the ground beneath you has shifted. Things are uncertain and there's no turning back. The world around you is different now. Unrecognizable. And there's nothing you can do about it. You're stuck. Your future is staring you in the face and you're not sure you like what you see. Like I said\u I'm not big into change.|[[Alex Karev]]}}\n\n'''Alex Karev''' is the former [[Chief of Surgery]] at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] and former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of\ua[[Pediatric Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He is the father of twins,\ua[[Alexis Stevens|Alexis]] and [[Eli Stevens|Eli]], with his ex-wife and current partner,\ua[[Izzie Stevens]]. He was also married to\ua[[Jo Wilson]] before learning about Eli and Alexis.\n\n\n\nWhen Alex was seven, he had to start cleaning up his drunk and drug addict father. At that point, he became the adult of the family as his mother was schizophrenic. Alex described himself as being \"raised in a bar\" and that his father never took him to the park or camping.<ref>[[Where the Boys Are]], x</ref>\n\nAs a kid, Alex was fat, and in th or th grade, the other kids started to pick on him for it. He was called names and pranked and even shoved in a locker once. He then started to think of himself as the fat kid in class and the screw-up at home. It was hell for him until the summer after the th grade, when he spent the entire summer school break on his bike riding everywhere. He lost so much weight that people barely recognized him when school started again.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Alex's father left he took care of his mother and his siblings. Alex was in  different foster homes in the course of  years. He also spent time in juvenile detention for stealing food for his family.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Parents]], x</ref> He also admitted his mother into a psychiatric facility at one point. When he was , he stole a car to help his little sister Amber.\n\nAlex lost his virginity to a school nurse when he was .<ref>[[Can't Fight Biology]], \ud</ref>\n\nHe missed his high school prom because his father came home and was drunk and started to break things at the house, so Alex stayed home with him. He had a prom date whom he liked and even got her a bracelet, but he never talked to her again because he felt that he stood her up and thought she wouldn't want to talk to him again.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nAt some point, Alex legally changed his last name to Karev, his mother's maiden name, to disassociate himself from his father, [[James Evans]].\n\nAfter Alex's grandmother died, he had a dream where she told him not to play with his ''parts''.\n\nHe attended college at [[University of Iowa]], where he wrestled.\n\n\nAlex started his internship at the same day [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[George O'Malley|George]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] did. He was at first assigned to a different resident, named Jeremy, than the other four. On his first day, Meredith saved one of his patients from a post-op complication in front of the chief after Alex dismissed the nurse and Meredith several times. He joined Miranda Bailey's service later, after his first resident gave him up for unknown reasons. He didn't get along with his colleagues due to his work attitude. For example, he would only pick the good and interesting cases and steal them from his colleagues. After a few weeks, the other interns learned of his softer, more understanding side and they became friends. Izzie took a particular liking to him and was first to notice the other, nicer side of him.\n\nIn the beginning, he told everyone that his dream specialty was [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]], but after he got to know the specialty closer, Alex discovered that it wasn't for him. He wanted to go into plastics because most of the time the patients there willingly chose their pain. After a longer stint with [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], Alex discovered that he liked to work with infants and began to develop a keen interest in [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]].\n\n\nAlex rescued [[Rebecca Pope|Rebecca]] while she was pregnant during the [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] accident. He also helped her pick a \"new face\" for Dr. Sloan to construct. Because of her new face and because she couldn't remember her real name, Alex nicknamed her Ava. Later on, Rebecca returned and they had a brief relationship during which she believed he got her pregnant (which was investigated by Izzie and turned out to be false). A bit later, under pressure from Izzie, Ava revealed the truth to Alex. Before she came back to Seattle, Ava had developed a borderline personality disorder. A part of this disorder was that she had forgotten that she already had a baby. Alex took care of her during her second stint in Seattle, but he couldn't prevent Ava's suicide attempt. Alex found her in Meredith's kitchen and took her to the ER, where she was treated by Izzie. Izzie pressured Alex to get her admitted to the psych ward. At first, Alex wouldn't allow that and told Izzie that she was \"only going through a bad patch\", and that he could take care of her. After a long talk with Izzie, Alex admitted that Ava needed help and that he couldn't give it to her.\ua\n\n\nAlex and Izzie had a rocky start to their relationship. In the beginning, Izzie disliked him as he was arrogant and cocky. He even plastered her modeling photos around the hospital to humiliate her. Izzie eventually saw the softer side of him and they had an on and off relationship. Alex and Izzie got married after a tumor was removed from her brain, but a second one was found by [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Shepherd]]. Izzie made a treatment error that endangered the life of a patient, and she ended up getting fired from the Surgical Program. She believed that her getting fired was partially Alex's fault, so she wrote him a Dear John letter and left Seattle. Then, she returned and attempted to get back together with Alex, but he refused because of the fact that she had left him, and they ultimately got divorced.\n\n\nAlex got shot in the lower chest by [[Gary Clark]] upon discovering him standing over Reed's body. After Gary had walked off, Alex dragged himself onto an elevator and got discovered by Mark and Lexie. They took him to an empty conference room and put in a chest tube.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref> Alex thought he was dying and advised Mark to have more sex and eat more bacon. Lexie confessed her love for him as he received a blood transfusion, but Alex mistook her for Izzie. He told her he was happy that she came back for him and asked her not to leave him again. Soon after, they were evacuated by a SWAT member and transported to [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital|Seattle Pres]], where [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] operated on him.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlex and his fellow fourth year residents began the race for the position of chief resident. Alex initially fell behind in the race because he didn't have any projects to work on while his peers were going off on their own. However, an idea was planted into his head when he joined Robbins in looking at scans of a patient in need of surgery. When he asked if he could scrub in, Robbins informed him that the child was in Africa and wouldn't be getting the surgery because she needed to stay to care for [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|her own sick child]] who was in the NICU at the time.\uaIt would cost too much to fly him out herself and she was at a loss as to getting someone who was willing to bring that kid, plus the dozen others, to the US for surgery.\n\nLater, when prompted by Owen about his plans for chief resident, Alex impulsively blurted out a plan to bring over a group of African kids for much needed surgeries.\uaFrom that point, Alex committed himself to the Africa Project, despite a rocky start.\uaHe initially presented his plan to Dr. Stark, asking for the help and money he needed to get the project off the ground. Stark denied him, however, because despite all of Alex's good intentions, he wasn't good at organizing the logistic part of the project, coming off as disorganized and \"half-assed\", according to Stark.\n\nResorting to Plan B, Alex went to one of his rich patients, [[Gladys Pulcher]], who was suffering from late stage lung cancer. Pulcher, dubbed \"Dragon Lady\" by Alex because of her constant cold and mean spirited remarks, refused and threatened to sue him and the hospital. Alex persisted, however, going as far as to show her pictures of the many sick kids before she sent him away. She asked for him later when Lexie was having trouble moving her without causing pain. He refused to help unless she agreed to give him money for his project.\uaShe agreed and Alex walked away victorious. His glee was short lived as Pulcher coded and died soon after.\n\nDespite the financial setback, Alex proceeded with his plans, first charging his credit cards and then giving \"I owe you\" promises until the children were set to arrive. Frantic and crumbling under the pressure of owing so much money and living up to the expectations he had set up for these kids, Alex nearly had a meltdown. He attempted to run away from the problem, ignoring Lexie who was hounding him about the debt, and instead, focusing on helping the kids.\uaHowever, a check came in the mail just in time from the lawyer handling the estate of Gladys Pulcher, giving Alex two hundred thousand dollars and essentially funding the project.\n\nThe children arrived and the surgeons of Seattle Grace Mercy West were able to give them their surgeries successfully. The project put Alex as the front runner in the race for chief resident.\n\nThe project was temporarily threatened when a new doctor, [[Mel Barnett|Dr. Mel Barnett]], took over for Robbins while she recovered after the plane crash and her amputation.\uaAccording to Barnett, the project didn't fit in his agenda for pediatrics and would have been shipped over to a different hospital. This, however, did not happen as Alex stayed in Seattle instead of going to Baltimore to do his fellowship at Johns Hopkins.\n\n\nWhen Meredith was working on Derek's Alzheimer's trial, Alex spotted her walking down the hall with a trial packet under her lab coat. She convinced him not to rat her out for a while, saying \"Nothing I did changes anything.\" However, the race for chief resident was on and when Meredith became a top contestant, Alex told Hunt what he saw her do while drinking at Joe's. Meredith retaliated by kicking Alex out of her house, despite his many apologies. When Richard found out that she switched the packets so Adele would receive the active ingredient, he decided to take the fall for her and Meredith was able to keep her job and she eventually forgave Alex.\n\n\nWhen the residents first began applying for [[Fellow|fellowships]], Alex was concerned because the interviews Robbins lined up were all at second rate hospitals. However, he soon discovered that Robbins was only doing this to convince him to stay at Seattle Grace Mercy West, and began to get calls from the country's top hospitals. He verbally committed to staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West and being Arizona's fellow. However, after [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] created a fellowship spot just for him, he decided to take that spot, angering Arizona and leading her to take his spot on the plane that ultimately crashed. His guilt over her replacing him led him to agree to stay in [[Seattle]] while she recovered, even amputating her leg himself when the time came. After delaying his move to Johns Hopkins for months, he eventually decided to stay in Seattle and take Arizona's fellowship.\n\n\nAlex and Jo begin dating after them both denying their feelings for each other. Jo and Alex fight over his father, but Alex realizes Jo was doing it because she loved him. They both were in foster care growing up. Alex proposes although Jo does not realize that that's what he was doing until he introduces her as his fianc\uee. When the board introduces the non fraternization policy, they fake a break up. Meredith finds a solution in a love contract, which they both have to sign, which states that their relationship is consensual.\n\nAlex didn't have an easy relationship with his father, [[James Evans]]. James abused Alex, his mother, and his siblings when they were young. James struggled all his life with a drug and alcohol addiction. At age , Alex stood up to his father, beat him up, and threw him out of the house. Alex later admitted to a patient that he had gone too far.\n\nYears later, Alex met his father again at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] after James was admitted to the ER. James and two of his friends were in a car crash and they were obviously on some drugs. It is later confirmed that the drug of his choice is heroin. After Alex recognized his father, he couldn't find the courage to speak with him in the hospital. After James was discharged, Alex tracked him down in a bar, but still couldn't find the courage to talk to him. Alex visited the bar the night after his initial visit and after a few drinks, he got into a fight with his father once again. After that fight, James recognized Alex as his son. He said he recognized Alex because of his angry eyes, which were the same when Alex was . After that incident, Alex left James for good. A while later, James came back to the hospital after quitting the drugs cold turkey. He said to [[Jo Wilson|Jo]] that he wanted to get clean for his family. At first, Alex declined to help him. After a while and a little push from Jo, Alex made up his mind and at least tried to help and talk to his dad.\n\nAfter [[Shane Ross|Shane]] froze while operating on James's heart, Alex was angry at Shane and tried to make his dad happy. He even went so far to lie to James's [[Naomi Evans|second ex-wife]] to get her to visit James. When James died, Alex was relieved and sad at the same time. Shane tried to apologize to Alex, but he was still angry at him and Alex beat him up in front of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Jo Wilson|Jo]]. Alex only stopped because Meredith held him back.\n\n\nAlex left GSM temporarily to join a private practice with [[Oliver Lebackes]]\uafor the purpose of making enough money to pay off his medical school debts. When\ua[[Maggie Pierce|Pierce]] accidentally revealed in the OR that Alex was looking for a spot on the board, Lebackes fired him on the spot. Even though he didn't get the spot, GSM hired him back as an attending peds surgeon.\n\n\nWhen surgical intern Andrew DeLuca was helping Jo get into bed after a night of drinking, Alex walked in and saw Andrew on top of her. Assuming that Andrew was sexually assaulting her, Alex violently physically assaulted Andrew, leading to the former temporarily injuring his hand and the latter sustaining several critical injuries. When Meredith figured out that Alex was the one who had caused the damage to Andrew, she promised not to tell anyone, even going to the extent to lie to her colleagues about Alex's guilt.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew decided to press charges, Alex and his attorney thought it was for a misdemeanor, but quickly learned that the state had upped the charge to felony assault. Alex pled not guilty, When Bailey found out that one of her attending pediatric surgeons was charged with a felony, she was forced to suspend him from the surgical staff and offered him a position in the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]], which he accepted.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref> While working in the clinic, he had to get surgical consults, as he did not have surgical privileges. This, as well as being supervised by a nurse, led to Alex being quite frustrated with his temporary assignment.<ref>[[Falling Slowly]], x</ref>\n\nThe day before the trial, Alex talked to Meredith and Maggie about how it was his \"last day on earth,\" and how they needed to drink that evening, despite Meredith's assurance that the trial would go well. After learning that Jo was married, which she was worried about being discovered during the trial, Alex decided to take the plea deal, which involved him serving two years.<ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\nAlex went to the District Attorney's office to take the plea deal, but Andrew unexpectedly walked in and tried to drop all charges against Alex. When he was told that since the case belonged to the state, he could not do that, he threatened to sabotage the case, which the attorney said was \"a slam dunk.\" Andrew walked out before Alex could understand why he decided to drop the charges. The two eventually had a conversation outside of the hospital in which Andrew says that he did it to protect Jo, and expressed frustration that Alex never apologized when he had the chance. After a meeting, Bailey offered to reinstate Alex with full surgical privileges once she received the papers showing that the charges had been dropped.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlex tracked down Jo's husband, [[Paul Stadler]], and spied on him at a medical conference. He told Meredith that he planned to confront Paul, but never actually spoke to him. He later revealed to Jo that he saw Paul but didn't act violently towards him like Jo thought he would. Alex and Jo then got back together after Jo realized that she could trust him. Soon after, she invited him to move back into the loft by holding up a sign reading \"Homecoming?\", a move inspired by a shared patient.\n\nJo found herself hesitant to be included in an article about Meredith's surgery, as it showcased how much control her husband still had over her. When presented with the opportunity to become Chief Resident, she decided she was done hiding and filed for divorce from Paul. On her first day as Chief Resident, Jo was shocked when Paul showed up at the hospital with the divorce papers. Meredith stepped in and told Alex to stay away from Paul as he wanted to beat the guy up, so she helped Jo handle the divorce. The next day, Paul was brought in after a hit-and-run, which Meredith incorrectly\uafirst suspected was Alex and Jo's doing. Alex stayed clear of Paul's room per Meredith's instructions, but he stood by Jo as she was left with the decision about what to do with Paul after he slipped in an act of aggression towards Jo and his new fianc\uee Jenny and was declared brain dead. She chose to donate his organs and was overwhelmed with relief to finally be free.\n\n\nAlex came home and Jo was waiting for him. Jo started to say that she never fit in\uaanywhere and that's why she always ran. She continued to say that maybe she ran from anyone who ever loved her. Alex paused her and started to look for the ring. He couldn't find it because Jo was already wearing it. Jo knelt down in front of Alex and said she didn't want to go anywhere without him and he is her home. She asked if he wanted to marry her. He said yes.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nAfter months of being engaged, Alex and Jo arrived at the big day. However, everything that could go wrong, did. While the wedding was delayed by people going to the wrong address and minister being late, Alex and Jo snuck off to have sex in a shed and got locked in. When they were finally saved by Meredith and Andrew, they returned to the wedding site to find their wedding planner having a serious allergic reaction. The final straw was when [[Levi Schmitt]]\uafainted at the sight of blood and knocked over the wedding cake. Alex and Jo decided to get married at sea on a ferryboat, with their ceremony being officiated by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile on their honeymoon in Los Angeles, Jo talked about an article she had read on cancer cells. It felt new to her, while Boston didn't. Alex said he wouldn't mind for their kids to grow up in Boston. Jo then said she had a thought and ran off from the beach.\n[[File:xAlexKarev.png|thumb|Jo needs to work on her idea.]]\nThinking he had talked about kids too fast, he found her at a beach bar and apologized. She told him at wasn't about the kids. She had an idea and she needed to focus, so she asked him to shut up while she was writing things down on a napkin. The bartender treated Alex to a beer on the house. Jo retreated back to their hotel room, while Alex spent the day enjoying himself outside. When he came back, Jo presented him with her idea to design cancer killer cells by introducing suicide genes in the cancer cell DNA. She feared he hated her for ruining her the honeymoon, but he was just delighted that she agreed to marry him and commented that their kids would be very smart.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nThey returned to Seattle the next day and they talked to Meredith about creating a surgical innovation fellowship just for Jo. Meredith took the idea to Bailey, who told her there was no room on the budget unless she did not re-hire Alex, as they had just spent a lot of money on the hyperbaric medicine lab. Meredith then told Jo to go to Boston and come back when they found the money, but Jo had already turned Boston down by that point. Both out of a job, they went to Joe's for day drinking. Jo revealed she had only applied for Boston because she could, but she did not really want to move there as it felt like going backwards. Jo then decided to go back to Bailey and explain why she was the future of medicine. The meeting was very productive for the couple. Bailey decided to fund the fellowship with her own money and appointed Alex interim Chief of Surgery, as she herself needed a sabbatical. Meredith was not happy about the move but Alex told her she still got him around this way and that it was time for Jo to move on to her own stuff.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|As Chief, Alex throws Richard off his patient's case.]]\nAlex was thrown in the deep end of the pool on his first day as Chief. He signed off on Link's project to -D print prosthetics for kids. Alex feared that Bailey only picked him because he would never live up to her, so that she would be welcomed back with open arms after her sabbatical, but she told him that she did trust him to do the job. However, he messed up the OR board, missed appointments with his peds patients, and later butted heads with Richard when he wouldn't stop berating a supposedly drunk patient. He found some comfort with Meredith, who told him that every Chief always feel like they're pissing people off and doing a poor job. At the end of the day, Alex fired Vik when he lost a patient due to not taking his nosebleed seriously and did not take responsibility for it. Bailey checked on his work and found that he had spent the entire quarter's budget in one day. Jo left them to talk so they could correct his mistake.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAlex hated the job because everyone kept asking for stuff, including his wife. He froze some funding he had approved earlier, including Link's project. Alex got himself a case of a [[Julius Guerra|young man]] with a pulmonary bleb, but the man refused surgery because his insurance wouldn't cover it. Alex paged Richard for advice, but he refused to do Alex's job for him. He only told him being Chief is finding creative ways to get out of corners you've been backed into. Alex wanted to quit, but Richard told him you only quit when you've tried something to the best of your abilities, otherwise it's just failing. Alex then get creative and made a small cut in the patient's chest so that the surgery would qualify as a trauma surgery. Richard yelled at him, but Alex told him about the time when he was  and he stole his neighbor's car to drive his sister, who was spiking a fever, to the hospital. Like Alex had hoped, the patient was happy to have his bleb removed and wouldn't report it. Alex was delighted to have found his groove as Chief. While heading home, Alex and Jo ran into Link, who apparently knew Jo from her past life as Brooke.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nAlex found out that Link and Jo had worked together waiting tables and that he was like a brother to her, but Alex gave him the cold shoulder while they working together on [[Rafi Elshami]]. Link noticed his threatening and dismissive demeanor and assured him that he and Jo had not been involved romantically. Alex then revealed that his problem was that Link had not protected her from Paul like a good brother would have. Link said he tried to tell her that he did not like Paul, but then Paul grew jealous and made Jo back away. He thought he was being respectful in honoring the distance, but he would not have if he had known that Paul was abusing her. Alex then warmed up to him. While he was catching up on paperwork after the surgery, Jo came by and he told her that Link was a great guy. He and Jo then started doing honeymoon things in the office.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nJo started helping Alex out a bit at work because the workload made him grumpy all the time. Jo and Bailey revived a liver with a perfusion system, but Alex ordered them to shut it down because it could risk their standing with UNOS. He later operated with Meredith on [[Flor Medina]] and they discussed Meredith's father's impending death from AML. He advised her to go see him, because he found it had been good for him to be able to say goodbye to his own father. After the surgery, he found out that Jo and Bailey had gone against his orders and were performing a transplant with the revived liver. While angry at first, the transplant worked, so he then took Jo into his office and admitted to being turned on by her genius. They closed the blinds in his office when they wer spotted kissing by [[Frankie Shavelson|nurse Frankie]]. That night, they invited Link to the loft so Jo could properly cut his hair and Meredith came over, too, when she found herself in need of company. She took over from Jo and Alex and Jo agreed that Meredith and Link looked good together.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWhen nurse Frankie got in distress, Alex found that the entire nursing staff was worried about her and assisted Richard in surgery. Alex delivered the baby and took care of him himself so as to provide the best possible care. Alex himself had to call time on death on Frankie as Richard wouldn't give up. Her baby survived and was watched closely by a group of nurses.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nAlex and Jo overslept on the day that a wind storm hit Seattle. They jumped out of bed to leave for work, but found that the storm made it unsafe to leave their house. Alex then had Bailey cover him. He found out how understaffed the hospital was, making him feel like a crappy leader. To cheer him up, Jo decided they could have a second honeymoon while staying in. Alex struggled to get reception so he had a hard time staying up to date with business at the hospital. He and Jo discovered neither of them had mailed in their marriage license, meaning their marriage wasn't official yet. They then went through all their wedding gifts. April had registered for them so they ended up with a bunch of stuff they didn't need. They agreed to return most of it and buy a bigger television with the money they'd get back. They then resorted to drink beer out of fancy glasses and making out.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nAs soon as he heard the bridge had been re-opened, Alex left for work. He caught Levi and Nico getting dressed after sex in an ambulance and was ordered by Bailey to step in for her in harvesting [[Phoebe Moss|Phoebe Moss']] organs so she could go take care of the hospital. He later confronted her about the way she had spoken to him. Bailey admitted that she was in crisis back then and didn't trust herself to finish the surgery. She told him she still needed more time to work on herself and asked him not to quit. He agreed not to and help her out in any way she needed. He later called out Nico and Levi for what they did and directed them to rooms with doors that lock.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAlex settled in the Chief job and got the hang of it. When Teddy was looking for a job, Bailey referred her to Alex, who made her audition for Maggie. Jo had been treating [[Natasha Deon]] all day and thanked Alex for being alive and having married her. Alex heard about Andrew stepping up and performing a solo surgery when Owen was accidentally paralyzed in the OR and congratulated him on pulling it off.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex and Jo get in a festive mood.]]\nWith the holidays approaching, Alex chose to gift everyone on staff a ham. He and Jo organized a navy blue scrubs only NYE party at their loft. The two of them handed out beers before the countdown and kissed at midnight. At work, Alex came up with an idea to give Natasha and [[Garrett Boland]] the wedding under the stars they had always wanted. Meredith officiated with all doctors holding up their phones with images of stars on display.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nAs Chief, Alex decided to initiate a weekly free breakfast for the interns in the cafeteria. At the same time, a gallery with pictures of all past and present Chiefs was installed there. Jo made him pose next to his photo and sent a picture to [[Helen Karev]] to show her how far her son had come. Bailey found herself bugged by Alex's picture on there and reminded him of the time he wanted to step down but she still needed time. Now, she felt ready to return. However, Alex told her he had gotten good at the job and that he wanted to keep the job till the end of the six-month contract they had agreed to. Begrudgingly, she told him she was proud of him for standing up for himself.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith was breaking her longest surgery record, Alex had to navigate a flood of overdose patients. He and Jo treated a woman who lost her kid in the chaos at the park where the overdoses originated, only to later discover that she had taken her kid to the park so she could score some drugs. Reminding him of the time his father left him in a parking lot when he was six, Alex had a strong reaction to the situation and told the kid's father to do whatever he needed to to protect his son, even if it meant keeping him away from his mother. Jo later brought Alex a cup of hot chocolate to comfort him and he told her he loved her.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex is surprised by his mother's visit.]]\nOn the day of Catherine's party, Meredith told Alex about her and Andrew dating. After mocking her a bit, as a friend, he was happy for her, and as Chief, he told her to inform HR. He then got ready to leave. Taryn came in to tell him that \"Mrs. Karev\" wanted to see it. He thought she was talking about Jo and told her to tell Jo to meet him at the party. Alex was the first to arrive at the party and indulged in appetizers and ping-pong while mocking Jackson about his ridiculously huge and luxurious penthouse. Having ignored his phone, Alex was surprised when Jo showed up at the party with his mother, who claimed she just came by for a visit. While he and Jo discussed their suspicion of a psychotic break and planned to her back to their loft, Helen disappeared into the crowd. They eventually found her and Helen showed Alex a bag of scarfs she had knitted as a wedding present. He picked the green one as it was his favorite color as a child.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex introduces Helen to Meredith.]]\nHe then tried to reach his mom's doctor, but he couldn't reach them. He hated that a mere visit could be a sign of a split from reality. Now that she was doing fine, he didn't know what the warning signs were anymore, unlike in his childhood. He and Jo watched Helen knit and decided to wait until tomorrow to find out what was going on. He later went to tell her that her visit threw him, but it meant a lot to him. Helen was the first to detect the smell of smoke. Alex thought it was another sign and tried to keep her calm while she urged everyone to get out, disturbing the celebratory toast. However, she turned out to be right and they evacuated the penthouse with the other characters. Out on the street, Alex introduced his mother to Meredith, who confirmed she and Alex were each other's best friend. Alex and Jo then took Helen home and helped her get settled on their couch. Despite her being right about the fire, they still were not convinced she was okay.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex has doubts about approving Vincenzo's research.]]\nJo and Alex took Helen with them to the hospital to show her around. She had been knitting baby hats ever since Alex told her they wanted kids. Before heading into back-to-back meetings, he asked Bailey to cover the ER. She commented she was counting down the  days before she could stop taking orders from him. His first meeting was with [[Vincenzo DeLuca]], Andrew, and Carina. Vincenzo wanted to start research about gestational sacks. Seeing potential, Alex asked for two days to consider, although he was inclined to say. However, Meredith warned him to dig into Vincenzo's past, though she kept his mental illness a secret so as to not break Andrew's trust.\n\nAlex took Helen to a park for lunch. He hated that he didn't come up with Vincenzo's idea of his own. They talked about his childhood. As a -year-old, he once asked her what the inside of a doorknob looked like. She took one apart to show and he wouldn't let her put it back together until he one day did it himself. So, she thought he would be an engineer. He said he was more of a fixer than an innovator, but she disagreed. She had always been in awe of his brain. Alex then brought up the baby hats that freaked out Jo. Helen says she only meant to give Jo a little nudge. Carina eventually informed Alex about her father's mental illness. He didn't want to say no because of that given his experience with his mother, so he approved to provide funding for the research. Later, Jo told him she freaked out not because of him but because she didn't know anything about her genome and her biological parents' medical history, so she decided to have her genome examined.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Alex was hopeful about the DeLuca research, Bailey thought he had stared a moral slippery slope that she would have to handle soon. When a lamb died in one of the sacks, Carina thought it best to remove her father, who downplayed the death, from the research as it as too important to let it be screwed up by him, but Andrew disagreed. After a talk with Helen, Bailey came to tell Alex that Helen had been sticking around longer than planned because she was too scared to go home by herself and she didn't dare to ask for help. Teddy then paged Alex to tell him Vincenzo had pitched his research to help out a pregnant couple at risk of losing their baby. Alex, Carina, and Teddy had to deliver the news to the hopeful parents that they could not approve that procedure on humans yet and instead had to deliver the baby while doing the hysterectomy so it could pass away in its father's arms. Alex then called the DeLucas into his office and told them Vincenzo's major breach of protocol and reckless behavior had convinced him to stop the research. Furious, Vincenzo took his research back to Italy. While attending a fish fry hosted by Richard on the roof, Alex asked Bailey to cover for him while he flew back to Iowa with his mother. He and Helen said goodbye to Jo and left for the airport.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\n\nJo decided to seek out her biological family in Pittsburgh. Once she got there, she stopped answering his calls, worrying him. He spent the day working with Andrew, who was shutting Meredith out ever since the failed research project with his father. They were to perform a total pancreatectomy. Andrew thought Meredith had asked Alex to put him on the case to cheer him up and said he didn't need any favors. The patient, [[Nora Hillridge]], was sabotaging her own surgery by drinking juice to increase her glycemia so that she could stay in the hospital and wouldn't have to go back to school. The doctors found out and Andrew went a bit overboard in his attempts to convince Nora's mother to make her daughter get the surgery. Alex then threw Andrew off the case, but Andrew went to talk to Nora behind his back and convinced her to consent to the surgery by talking about how he overcame being bullied. Alex then performed the surgery behind Andrew's back to punish him for not obeying his orders. Andrew later confronted him about that move and Alex told him that he was letting the stuff with his father interfere with his job and relationship. He told Andrew not to bite people's hand when they reach out because then they stop reaching out. Alex then went home and found Jo in bed. He told her he missed her and got ready for bed, not noticing in the dark that she was crying and only pretending to be asleep.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nShe didn't talk to him about what had happened and started to avoid him, leaving for work while he was in the shower. It was his last day of Chief and he confronted her about not telling him what happened, but she gave some vague answer about needing Bailey for a fellowship grant and left. At the end of the day, he asked her to go out to celebrate his no longer being Chief, but she wanted to crawl into bed after the rough day she had. He wanted to join, but she needed to be alone and told him to go celebrate with Meredith. He once again told her she could tell him anything as he wouldn't judge given his own family history. She firmly stated she did not want and could not talk about it. She then went home by herself.<ref>[[Silent All These Years]], x</ref>\n\nFor a week, Jo pretended to be sick and did not go back to work. He knew she was lying, but she continued to completely shut him out and lie in bed all day. He went to work in a suit, something he had grown to like as Chief. Bailey paged him to ask about the compliance reports due tomorrow, but he had no idea what she was talking about. Alex took the case of [[Gus Carter]], a kid with autism that the doctors had to communicate with through LEGO blocks. Alex then reached out to Link to find out if he knew anything, but Link didn't even know she had looked up her birth mother. Alex then asked him to go over to his loft and distract her. The doctors diagnosed Gus with a thymoma, which was compromising his immune system, but they couldn't operate until they had transfused him to cure his anemia. However, the transfusion went badly and they discovered he had the extremely rare Rh blood type, meaning he could only receive blood from the exact same type. That meant that they had to put off the surgery until they found a match. Alex then received a text from Link. He rushed to the loft and found Jo laughing hysterically at a cartoon. Alex thought she was doing better, but Link told her she was in a rough shape, unlike anything he'd ever seen before. He was sure she needed help, but he did not know how to do that.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nAlex managed to get Jo to agree to come back to work. He urged all of his colleagues not to make a big deal out of it. Meredith found him and told him she tried with [[Cristina Yang]] and [[Marie Cerone]] if they could help out for Gus's blood, but to no avail. Alex then told her Jo still wasn't talking. He was afraid Jo had finally broken and would leave him, like all his previous lovers had done. Meredith assured him that she wouldn't. She just wasn't ready to talk yet. Later, he heard she came to work drunk and confronted her about it at home. Angrily, he told her he was done being told to leave her alone if he loved her and he threatened to go to Pittsburgh himself to find out what had happened. She told him she would talk when she was ready to and that she'd leave him if he threatened to go Pittsburgh ever again. They then made a deal that he would report her to Bailey if she came to work drunk again, so she promised she wouldn't.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nJo was assigned to monitor Gus while Alex and Meredith took on the case of [[Gabriella Rivera]], a kid with an obstruction that required surgery. Gabriella's father was an immigrant cleaning offices for a living and he made too much money to qualify for state coverage for the surgery, which was too expensive for Luis to pay. Meredith then put Ellis's name down on the paperwork. Before they headed into surgery, Jo found Alex and told him she had found a donor for Gus. He called her a good luck charm and gave her instructions to prepare Gus for surgery. After Gabriella's surgery, during which they found cancer, Alex found Jo sobbing in [[Lori Carter|Lori Carter's]] arms. Alex took Jo away and found out she had mistaken a phone call from someone calling to see if Gus could donate blood as someone responding to their needing a donor. Alex met with Bailey in her office and vented his despair over the situation, not knowing what to do with Jo.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAlex then made arrangements with Meredith so that she could stay at the loft to get through to Jo while he helped out Amelia and Maggie with her kids. They finally found a donor for Gus from London. Alex sent Levi to go pick up the donor, who was severely agoraphobic, at the airport. However, when her therapist was arrested by customs for a problem with his visa, [[Frances Pinfield]] fled back onto the plane and refused to leave. Alex then sent Owen to help Levi out. Gus's parents grew frustrated while waiting. In between, Alex checked in on Gabby, who was doing well and spending time Andrew. Soon after, Gus had a heart attack and they managed to pull him through, but the need for transfusion only increased. While in the room, Owen FaceTimed Alex so Frances could meet Gus and his parents to convince her to get off the plane. That worked, but the car got stuck on the highway due to fog covering the city. With Gus's number rapidly worsening to the point of impending organ failure, Alex decided to took Gus to the hyperbaric chamber to guarantee maximum oxygen. Meredith, having reached a breakthrough with Jo, joined him in the chamber so they could talk.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith informs Alex on what has been going on with Jo.]]\nMeredith told him that Jo was the product of rape and that she had been told she looked just like her father, which sent her into a depression. Meredith had convinced her to get a proper leave of absence so she could ge the help she needed. The news made Alex think about the day she left for Pittsburgh. He was worried about what she'd find, but she told him that the worst that could happen was that her mother did not want to see her and then she'd just come home to him and at least she'd know. He thought he should have stopped her, but Meredith told him he couldn't have. She also told him he had tried to help her as best as he could, but she needed professional help. While in there, they were informed that the insurance company had found out about Meredith's insurance fraud and that Andrew was taking the fall for her. Meredith couldn't stop him since she was stuck in the chamber, where Gus started coding again. Alex started CPR and started to lose it, saying Jo had disappeared and now Meredith would be going to jail, leaving him all alone. Meredith told him he wasn't alone yet and took over. They pulled Gus through and Jo arrived with the blood right when the chamber was decompressed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex is fired along with Richard and Meredith for covering up the latter's insurance fraud.]]\nWhile Meredith took Gus away, Jo finally told Alex that she was not okay. She knew how to rise when she had to, but she needed help. Alex promised her they would figure it out. Richard then came to get Alex for Meredith's problems. The two of them went to back her in the meeting with Bailey and Catherine, which led to all three of them being fired by Bailey. Afterwards, Alex went to make sure Gus was fine, and then took Jo to the in-patient psychiatry ward. He said goodbye to her with a kiss and watched her check herself in. Bailey stood by him and as they left, he asked if he was really fired. She said it hurt her more than it did him.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAfter dropping Jo off at the psychiatric department, Alex went out for drinks with Link to inform him about Jo. Alex confessed he was scared that the treatment wouldn't work, as it had failed to help many other people in his life with psychiatric problems. Link told him Jo was a fighter and that she would come out stronger. However, when she did come out a week later, they decided to commit her to a -day program at a psychiatric facility. Alex dropped her off. Before heading in, she said she didn't want to be another name on his list of crazy people. He was convinced she would come out fine, but she reminded him that they weren't legally married and that she would understand if he were to take that out. He didn't reply and she headed into the facility.\n\nTwo weeks later, they met with Jo's doctor present. She told him that when he tried to talk to her in her depressive episode, she felt fear, shame, and pain. She was ashamed that she was unable to receive the love that he was giving her. She pushed him away and feared that she would never be able to regain his trust. Alex admitted he was scared, too. She knew he had had enough crazy for a lifetime and that he deserved more than someone weak who breaks like glass. The doctor said she was actually stronger than most for coming to the facility, but Alex didn't answer.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n\nA week later, Richard came by for a visit and noticed that Alex's life had fallen apart with Jo gone. He suggested Alex apply for the Chief of Surgery job at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] so he could hire him. Alex was hesitant, but Richard pointed out his life was a mess and that he needed to give Jo a reason to come back home. Alex then gathered himself and applied for the job, which he got. He then went to pick up Jo at the facility. He got down on knee and admitted he had thought about leaving because he was scared, but he had realized he was stronger with her by his side. He didn't care that she wasn't magically cured and proposed to her again, which she accepted.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOn Jo's first day back to work, Alex offered Jo a job at Pac-North so she could start with a clean slate, even allowing her to run her own fellowship. On Richard's first day at Pac-North as director of the general surgery program, he came to complain to Alex about the two only residents being terrible and to demand an office. Alex reminded him of the hospital's terrible rankings and the need to turn the place around. While the hospital's CT was down, the ER was flooded, including patients from Meredith's work crew. He called her to tell her to stop doing that and then checked in with Jo, who told him that Bailey made her the exact same offer as him. He then countered with an offer to make her general surgeon as he needed the extra hands. Alex was pulled onto an emergent case with Richard of a man who nearly died in the ER's waiting room. During surgery, Richard talked about missing working at Grey Sloan as he had imagined himself dropping dead one day in OR , which made him happy. They managed to save the patient. Afterwards, Alex told Richard that he had dreaded working at Pac-North, too, given the legacy he inherited at Grey Sloan from Bailey and Richard himself. However, he was convinced that they would be able to turn this place around so that failure was no longer the culture there and made Richard see that it could provide him with a new legacy other than dropping dead in Grey Sloan's OR. He came home to Jo, who told him she had used his offer to demand the attending position at Grey Sloan. Alex understood it was the better move for her and congratulated her.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nTogether, they started turning the place around. Alex arranged a new MRI machine for the hospital but they had to wait for the right software in order to be able to use it. A tough situation arose for Alex when Richard accidentally took a misidentified patient off of life support.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref> Alex was amused when Meredith's article came out, inadvertently trashing Grey Sloan specifically instead of the medical system itself. With the basics at Pac-North set straight, Alex and Richard started teaching the two residents at the hospital. He ran into Owen, who delivered a patient who had refused to be treated at Grey Sloan because of the article, and offered to give him a tour after learning he had taken up paternity leave to avoid having to work under [[Tom Koracick]]. During their tour, they came across a woman shouting for help from the ICU as one of the residents failed to deliver adequate help to her hemorrhaging husband. Alex and Owen jumped in and took the man to the OR, where they talked about the situation at Grey Sloan. Alex acknowledged that Bailey, like everyone else there, didn't deserve to work under Tom and inquired if Owen was tired of sitting at home yet. Alex then offered him the position of Head of Trauma Surgery, allowing him to structure the department as he saw fit. Owen accepted the position.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOne day after work, Alex came home and learned Jo had had a rough day. She didn't want to talk about it. He didn't want her to keep it inside like before. Instead, she started to throw toys at the wall to calm herself down, which she had learned worked for her while being treated for her depressive episode. She invited Alex to join her and he admitted it felt satisfying.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Jo tried to scare Alex while he was getting ready for work but he was too occupied with his meeting with investors that day. Alex and Richard led the group around the hospital. To distract them from a chaotic ER, Alex wanted to take them to the construction site of the new research wing, which was on budget and ahead of schedule, but a construction worker came to get him for something he had to see first. Alex left the group in Richard's hands and went with the worker, who showed him they had come across skeletal remains while digging. They discovered it was a mass grave, a remnant of the hospital's past as a psychiatric facility, and decided to stop construction. Alex informed Richard, who took it upon himself to keep the investors busy while Alex handled the administrative load. Jo showed up with fake blood in another attempt to scare Alex but he was informed that multiple patients were crashing in the ICU. Jo suggested the hospital was haunted, which started a rumor amongst the nurses. Alex and Owen traced the source of the problem back to a broken fridge in the ICU's blood supply. He issued an order to only use Central Blood Supply from that point forward. Afterwards, Alex overheard the gossip and loudly announced the authorities had been informed about the mass grave while assuring everyone the hospital was not haunted. His announcement came right when Richard walked in the with the investors. Alex took the investors to his office and explained the situation properly. They were impressed with his ability to handle chaos and approved more funding. Jo dropped by his office and he wanted to celebrate the good news with her. He thought it was a good time to get legally married and they went to the courthouse. During her vows, she finally managed to scare him by claiming she was pregnant. She set the record straight and the ceremony continued.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, Maggie arrived at Pac-North with Richard's brother and niece, who needed surgery to remove a myxoma. Alex granted Maggie privileges so she could perform the surgery there and introduced her the stuff, expressing his hopes that she might decide to come work there, which had worked before. Maggie lost the patient and panicked as she had convinced the family to let her operate against their initial wishes. Alex comforted her and let her vent her feelings before they went to inform Richard and his brother together.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nAlex took the day off for Meredith's hearing before the medical commission and was one of the few people to follow the entire hearing. He testified that Meredith made him a better surgeon and person. When the prosecutor brought up the delay in Zola's adoption, Alex refrained from mentioning her kidnapping but the prosecutor pressed him and asked if it had anything to do with her brief firing at the time. Alex hesitated and wondered why Meredith's family was relevant to the hearing. [[Paul Castello]] pointed out she seemed pretty cavalier about the law in both her professional and personal life. Meredith then saved Alex from having to answer by lashing out at Paul, the man who had killed Derek, for not remembering her and thus not having the right to judge her. Paul then had a seizure and was taken away. The judge wanted to postpone the hearing but Alex loudly objected. He had brought together a whole group of people who had been treated by Meredith and had all come from all over the country to testify on her behalf. He had also gathered letters of support from Cristina, Addison, April, Callie, and Arizona. He read Cristina's out loud and offered to keep going but the judge had heard enough. The panel voted to dismiss the entire case, meaning Meredith would get to keep her license. Alex congratulated Meredith with the rest of the staff who had come out to support her.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nShortly afterwards, Alex\uatraveled to Iowa to visit his mother.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref> He remained in Iowa for a while and worked out a deal for Richard to hire Maggie at Pac-North from there.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref><ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref>\n[[File:xAlexMeetsKids.png|thumb|Alex meets his kids.]]\nHe started to ignore Jo and Meredith's calls and texts, which prompted Jo to call\uaAlex's mother, who revealed that Alex had never been in Iowa. Soon afterwards, Meredith, Jo, Bailey, and Richard all received letters from Alex, who explained that he had reconciled with Izzie during Meredith's trial. He said that he felt like him and Izzie were \"frozen in time\" and that they felt unfinished. He also\uafound out that she gave birth to his kids with the embryos they froze years ago due to the cancer having nuked her eggs. Alex said that he was staying with Izzie and their two children (Alexis and Eli)\uain Kansas and wouldn't be coming back to Seattle, because he wanted\uato ensure his kids\uadidn't grow up like he did, without a father, along with the fact that he loved Izzie.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite the callous image he projects, Alex is particularly affected when he treats addicts and abused children because of his childhood background. He initially refused to install a central line for a Demerol addict because he did not want to feed his habit. He was also able to connect with a teenage boy whose abusive father hit his mother.<ref>[[Enough is Enough]], x</ref>\n\nHe hides his pain behind a mask of aggression and bad attitude. For a while, he pushed everyone away, but since going into peds, he's showed more of who he really is. After Cristina left, he acted as Meredith's person, which shows a different side of his personality, which shows him as sweet, caring, and compassionate.\n\n\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nIzzie realized that Alex was not as insensitive and cruel as he portrayed himself to be. She began a tentative friendship with him, to the shock of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[George O'Malley|George]]. Later, Meredith's opinion of Alex changed for the better when he offered to listen to her problems with her mother, [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]].\n\nWhen Alex found out that Izzie was an ex-lingerie model, he obtained a copy of her advertisement and proceeded to paste copies all over Seattle Grace. Although he succeeded in humiliating her, she turned things on him by stripping to her underwear in front of him and several other interns, reminding him that her modeling is the reason why she is debt-free while he is \ucsitting on two hundred grand of student loans\ud.\n\nAlex eventually asked Izzie out on a date. However on that very day, he found out from the Chief that he failed his medical board exams. This caused him to suffer from a crisis of confidence, leading him to treat her shabbily during their date. His confidence took another blow when he froze up during a makeshift emergency surgery in an elevator during a power outage, and George had to operate on the patient himself. Izzie, still furious from the horrendous date, refused to speak to him. Afterwards, in Joe's bar, he went up to her and kissed her, rekindling their budding relationship. However, their sex life hit a bump when Alex had difficulties performing. Meanwhile, his confidence in his medical skills further deteriorated after he accidentally administered a wrong dosage saline solution, paralyzing the patient. In a moment of vulnerability, he slept with Olivia and was caught in the act by Izzie, effectively ending their relationship.\n\nIzzie subsequently found out about it and blew up at her friends for helping Alex. She eventually forgave him but ruled out getting back together with him. Alex passed his re-test and became a full-fledged doctor. During the code black, the dire situation of a bomb scare caused Izzie to realize that she should act on her feelings. She accosted Alex and the two proceeded to have sex in a linen closet. They continued to sleep together several times over the course of the day.\n\nIzzie's patient, Denny Duquette, was re-admitted after he suffered a heart failure. Alex was jealous of Izzie's concern for Denny, and tried to get Denny to back off by telling him that he was with Izzie and there is a good chance that he would die from his failing heart anyway. She confronted him, and he told her that she cannot get involved with her patients. However, Izzie realized that she didn't have to settle for Alex. Offended when Alex referred to the still-living Denny as a \"corpse\", she dumped him saying, \"Just so we're clear, we're over. On your very best day, that 'corpse' is twice the man you will ever be. You're not good enough for me, Alex. You're not good enough for anyone.\"\n\nWhen Denny died from a stroke, Alex picked up a devastated Izzie and told her that the dead man was no longer Denny, the man she once loved. Alex realized that his feelings for Izzie had not diminished since she dumped him, and impulsively kissed her in the stairwell. Izzie had yet to get over Denny and told him she cannot commit in a relationship with him just yet, and he understood. However, Alex claimed his lack of interest in Izzie and has appeared to have gotten over her.\n\nHis feelings for Izzie eventually came back and when she gave him an ultimatum (to pick between the nice Alex and the jerk Alex) he chooses nice and they begin to go out again. He starts dating Izzie exclusively and after winning his solo-surgery he tells her he loves her.\n\nFollowing the revelation of her cancer, Alex ''[[Snooching|snooches]]'' in a cup as they harvest Izzie's eggs in case they ever want a child. When Izzie is discovered to have an inoperable tumor, Meredith and Derek gave their wedding to Alex and Izzie and the two marry.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Alex and Izzie get married.]]\n\nAfter the death of [[George O'Malley]], and the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]], Izzie was fired partly because Alex told Chief Webber she couldn't handle the pressure of working because she was still recovering. He meant to protect her but Izzie didn't think so and she left Seattle, leaving Alex with unpaid medical bills and no ideas of where she was.\n\nAlex remained worried for weeks trying to join her because she had to treat her cancer and she didn't show up to her round of chemo. When she finally got back, to get some help for an old teacher, they didn't manage to work their problems out and Izzie left once again.\n\nIzzie eventually sent Alex divorce papers, and while Alex signed them and had committed to Lexie, Alex still loved her. He called out for Izzie while he was delirious after getting shot. Alex, thinking Lexie was Izzie, expressed his glee that she returned and begged her to stay with him.\n\nOver time, he started dating other girls and his love for Izzie faded. A couple of years after Izzie's departure, Alex entered a committed relationship with Jo Wilson. When a patient showed up that reminded Alex of Izzie, Jo told him to call Izzie to find out how she was doing. He stated he didn't need to, as he had made up a new life for\ualzzie in his head, in which she was married and working as a surgeon. He preferred not to call her and instead held onto\uathat imagined life for her, in which she's always smiling as she's as happy with her husband as Alex is with Jo.\n\nBefore Meredith's medical trial, Alex called Izzie to see if she would help out, and during the conversation, he found out she had given birth to twins and he was the father as a result of the frozen embyos. He decided to go meet them, which reignited his romance with Izzie. They are currently raising their son and daughter together in Kansas.\n\n[[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia Harper]]\n[[File:xAlexandOlivia.png|thumb|xpx|Izzie finds Alex cheating on her with Olivia]]\nGeorge contracted [[Medical Glossary#S|syphilis]] from Alex through [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]]. It was revealed that Olivia was already dating Alex when George asked her out. Olivia subsequently broke up with Alex after realizing how much she liked George. Furious at the revelation that Alex was the cause of his syphilis, George punched Alex in the face. That night, [[Joe]], the owner of [[Emerald City Bar]] was admitted to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], and in discussions with Joe, it was revealed that Alex was a regular at Joe's bar every night and that he and Joe had become close friends. When George finds a way to pay for Joe's hospital bills, the animosity between George and Alex is dissolved after Alex gives George a hug.\n\nA mixer was held for the new interns, and it was at this mixer that he met and presumably hit it off with Nurse Olivia Harper, as he is shown leaving the event with an arm around her.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nAddison discovered Alex's better side and found herself attracted to him. To some degree, Alex was also attracted to Addison as they subsequently shared frequent meaningful looks. This culminated in an actual kiss in Joe's bar. Later, during the -day trial with [[Mark Sloan]], Addison sleeps with Alex, breaking the deal. However, he later told her that he only wants to work with her professionally, and is not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her. It was his work with her that led Alex to no longer pursue [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]] as a [[Specialties|specialty]] but spark an interest in [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]].\n\n[[Rebecca Pope]]\nDuring a ferry accident, Alex found a severely injured pregnant woman crushed under a pylon. He rescued her from the debris and encouraged her to stay alive. The pregnant Jane Doe subsequently became hysterical after realizing she could not remember anything, and turned to Alex for support, thinking that he was her husband. Alex showed much concern for her and constantly checked on her progress, bonding with her in the process. He also helped her pick out a new face for reconstruction, as well as a new name \"Ava\". As Alex spent more time with Ava, he became increasingly attached to her, spending most of his time checking on her progress and doing research. This led Addison to accuse him of being too emotionally involved with a patient, but he countered saying that he was just being prepared. In the heat of the argument, Addison kissed him and pushed him into an on-call room, where the two had sex. However, Alex rebuffed Addison's subsequent advances, after learning she wanted a committed man to have kids with, something which he was not ready for.\n\nAfter Addison left, Ava returned\uaa couple times and they slept together. The last time she came, she told him that she was pregnant, which caused\uaAlex to ask whether she was keeping it. After that, he became more sensitive and had\uaher move in. After a couple days, Izzie confronted\uaAlex and rold him that Ava was not really pregnant and never was. Alex refused\uato believe it and so did Ava. Izzie showed\uahim the charts though, and he couldn't dispute that, so he told Ava, and she thought she had a miscarriage even though he told her there was no baby. She couldn't take care of herself and so he did everything for her, insisting that she was\uafine. Finally, she cut herself and Izzie admitted\uaher and forced\uaher to get a psych consult. Alex called\uaher husband, who told him that he left Ava and went with the child. He also said\uathat she'd already been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. She was taken to a psychiatric ward and Alex was forced to move on.\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nAlex decided to not wait for her and he slept with [[Lexie Grey]] just before Izzie came back home. She tried to convince him that they could start over but he had moved on and he decided to break up with Izzie. So Izzie left Seattle for apparently the last time, telling she couldn't stand it.\n\nLater, she sent the divorce paper to Alex, with her name signed on it. Alex then signed his name, kissed Lexie and they walked out of the hospital, hand-in-hand.\n\nAlex was shot in the hospital by a grieving deceased patient's husband, but survived with the help of Lexie and Mark. While undergoing treatment, he mistook Lexie for Izzie. He apologized to her and continued by telling her \"[she] came back\" and tearfully begging her never to leave him again; Lexie, declining to correct him, assured him that she never would. Following the shooting, Lexie had a mental breakdown in front of Alex. Mark asked Alex to help her but he refused and walks away. He returned to being very promiscuous and refused to have the bullet in his chest removed, saying that it was his \"war wound.\" After insulting Lexie, she cut him down to size, stating that he was not \"badass\" for living because she was the reason that he survived and that while he was dying, he cried out for the wife who left him, that is, Izzie. Alex is left speechless.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nAlex and Callie slept together after a big surgery involving reconstruction of a man's legs was successful. No one knew at the time, but the relationship was later revealed when Callie gave her speech on Lecture Day.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n\n[[Lucy Fields]]\nAlex had a brief romantic relationship with the attending OB/GYN Lucy Fields. At first, Lucy strongly disliked Alex after he called her patient a turnip, but after discovering they shared an equal enthusiasm for college basketball, she liked him slightly more. Eventually, they began a romantic and sexual relationship.\ua[[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]]\uaoffered Alex the proposal to go to Africa to tend to and check up on the patients who visited and received medical attention at Seattle Grace. Lucy was disappointed because as Alex was considering that opportunity, he didn't even think about Lucy. She shook it off by saying it didn't matter what she thought. Arizona approached Alex and asks him if he wasn't taking the job because of Lucy, as she didn't want him to do the same thing she did and run back to Lucy once in Africa. Alex told Lucy he was not taking the job in Africa because she was \"a factor.\" She told him to stop and said he was right when he said career comes first. She told him she took the job -- not at Baylor, but Alex's proposed job in Africa. She assured him it wasn't personal. Not long after that, she walked into Joe's and said to Alex, \"tell me not to go to Africa.\" He told her to go to hell.\n\nInterns\nWhile still planning to go to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], Alex was known as a \"player\" amongst the new interns and also as the attending who sleeps around with all of the interns because he didn't plan to stay at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nOne of the interns, [[Jo Wilson]], started up a close friendship with Alex. They bonded at Bailey's wedding as they talked about their hard upbringings. They saw\uaeach other as just friends. However, after some time, Alex began\uato see Jo in a different way. This was seen when he got\uajealous of her going on a date with an OB/GYN resident, [[Jason Myers]]. Jo and Alex began to separate as she and Jason became a couple and Alex tried to avoid his feelings for her. After Alex told Jason about Jo's past, Jo yelled at Alex and told him that she shouldn't have trusted him. Alex admitted his love for her to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] not long after that.\n\nThe two avoided each other almost entirely after their fight. One night, Alex witnesses Jo and Jason fighting. Not long after, she shows up at his doorstep and he begins to argue with her for being unavoidable. She turns her face toward him and it's clear that she has been hit by Jason. Alex takes her up to his bed and tucks her in.\n\n[[Perfect Storm|During the superstorm]], he finally admitted\uato Jo that he loves her and the couple shared\uaa kiss.\n\nAfter that, they began dating. They hit a bit of a rocky patch when Alex's dad came into the hospital from a car crash related to drugs. Alex asked Jo to do a paternity test, and he said he didn't want to know at the same time she said, \"he's your father.\" Alex then proceeded to stalk his father at bars where he was performing. When Alex didn't come home for  nights in a row,\uaJo got worried. He then told her what was happening and they worked it out.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Alex proposes marriage to Jo.]]\n\nAfter his dad returned to the hospital trying to get clean, Alex said goodbye for a final time. At [[April Kepner|April's]] wedding, Alex proposed to Jo, without actually saying that he wanted to marry her. When Jo realized that he proposed to her, she declined. However, they stayed together. Although Jo didn't accept Alex's proposal, he still knows that he will eventually marry her.\n\nAlex proposed to Jo for the second time two years later. At the same time, Jo was trying to dump Alex for spending too much time with Meredith. Alex asked Meredith to keep Jo's ring until the day he would propose to her. Jo unfortunately didn't know that Meredith was only trying to pass Jo's ring to Alex without her seeing.\n\nAfter Jo not answering the proposal, they broke up and after spending some time apart, they got back together. The unanswered proposal caused some strain on their relationship. She eventually told Alex that she didn't want the ring yet, but she also didn't want it gone and that he should keep in in the drawer.\n\nAfter a few months, Alex asked Jo if they would ever get married. He said it didn't have to be today or tomorrow but he wanted to know that it would happen. She said she couldn't, but Alex was adamant that she could. She said no.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\ua\n\nThey fought. She said she loved him and that they should make a baby, but he wanted to get married. He wanted to know why and as she went to tell him, he cut her off and stormed out. Later, she told Andrew the reason why she couldn't marry Alex was because she was already married to an abusive man and feared if she filed for divorce, he would find her. Alex didn't know this because she worried about him going after her abusive ex. Alex walked into the loft and found Jo giggling while half-naked and DeLuca on top of her in bed. He jumped to the wrong conclusion and began to punch him.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Alex told Jo that he'd found her husband and gone to see him, Jo locked the door and started kissing him, surprised that he'd seen her husband without killing him, which proved to her that Alex wasn't a violent guy.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\uaThey got back together and eventually got engaged. Their wedding ceremony was held on a ferryboat and was officiated by Meredith.\n\nAfter Jo visited her birth mom and entered a depressive episode, Alex stayed by her side and helped her recover. Jo felt bad for being another one of his crazy women and offered him an out, but instead, later on,\uaAlex proposed to her again. Jo accepted.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\uaThe two got married on Halloween.\n\nAfter Meredith's trial, Alex supposedly went to Iowa to tend to his sick mother, but after failing to return Jo's calls, she found out from his mom that he was never in Iowa. A few days later, Jo received a letter from him, saying he was living in Kansas with Izzie and their two kids. He explained that it felt like him and Izzie were \"frozen in time\" which caused him to want to stay with her.\uaHe said he loved Jo, and he meant it when he wanted to marry her, and also told her she would find a better man than him. He also sent her divorce papers.\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nInitially, Meredith disliked Alex. Meredith thought that Alex was a bad person, who just had sex with everyone in the hospital. He was not nice to anyone, especially fellow intern and Meredith's close friend\ua[[George O'Malley]]. Eventually,\ua[[Izzie Stevens]]\uabefriended Alex and Meredith accepted him as well. They maintained a close friendship throughout the years and Alex even made Meredith his best man at his wedding to Izzie.\ua\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Meredith and Alex talk about Derek]]\nWhen Izzie left the hospital after being fired, Meredith became a source of support for Alex. They maintained a very close friendship until Alex informed\ua[[Owen Hunt]]\uain a drunken state\uaof Meredith's tampering with the Alzheimer's trial. Meredith became furious with Alex, especially since this led to Zola being taken away. Alex worked hard for Meredith's forgiveness, however, and even went to the judge responsible for Zola's adoption case. He apologized to Meredith lots of times but she refused to forgive him at first. When [[Cristina Yang]] got Alex to get up and help Meredith to keep Zola, after yelling at him, he replied with, \"I don't have anyone! You guys are all I have! You're supposed to have my back! You have to forgive me!\" With his help, Meredith and\ua[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]\uagot Zola back. Since this, Meredith and Alex have recovered and maintain a close friendship. Alex also bought\ua[[Meredith's House|Meredith's house]]\uafrom her after he chose to remain in [[Seattle]].\n\nMeredith even went so far to help Alex come up with a lie to tell the police since his hand was bruised from attacking Andrew DeLuca, and she helped him calm down.\n\nThere has never been any sexual attraction between Alex and Meredith. When they lived together, Meredith would often sit in the bathroom while Alex showered and vent to him as they have a brother/sister relationship.\n\nWith Cristina's departure, Alex has become Meredith's new \"person\".\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nCristina and Alex have a love-hate relationship as they often make fun of each other but no matter what Alex, Cristina, and Meredith are there for each other. They are from the same intern class, so naturally, they are close as they have spent so many years together.\n\nWhen Alex buys Meredith's house, Cristina moves in.\n\nCristina told Alex on her last day in Seattle that she was surprised by how good he became as a surgeon. This was one of the very few compliments Alex has ever gotten from her. She also told Meredith that Alex needs to be mocked at least once a day or he'll be insufferable.\n\nAfter Cristina left Seattle for Z\ufcrich, Alex found an envelope in his bed that informed him that Cristina had left her shares of the hospital to him.\n\n[[Morgan Peterson]]\nMorgan was a surgical intern at Seattle Grace Mercy West. She was Alex's intern and was helping him study to pass his boards when she passed out. She had heart complications and needed an emergency c-section. She had a boyfriend, Chris, who worked at the [[Cleveland Clinic]]. The baby was born at  weeks, and Chris left a little while after the baby was born because he thought the baby was going to die and that it was pointless because the pregnancy was accidental anyway. Morgan decided to call the baby Tommy after her father. Alex was very attached to Tommy. Alex and Morgan got close, but Arizona scared Alex off of Morgan by telling Alex that Morgan was into him. Alex avoided her and Tommy for weeks. Alex tried to get back into the case later. He almost missed his flight to San Francisco to take his boards because he was taking care of Tommy. He then flew back to Seattle the night before his boards to take care of Tommy and helped Morgan when Tommy died.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nEver since the start of their internship, Alex has disliked George. On their first day as interns, George was given the name  (when he froze in his first surgery) by Alex and it was the start of their mutual dislike for each other. Later on, George learned that he had contracted syphilis from his girlfriend Olivia. George was given the name \"Syph-boy\" by Cristina but soon learned that Alex was the person that gave syphilis to Olivia, which lead to Alex being punched by George. And on a different occasion, when Alex told George that Callie had slept with Mark Sloan, George went into denial and got into another fight with him.\n\nAlex repeatedly and frequently pointed out George's flaws - calling him weak and pathetic more than once - but Alex later revealed that he actually respected George and that if he were still alive then he would have beaten all the other residents at each milestone (st solo surgery, chief resident, etc.). Professionally, George had beaten Alex during important situations, even though Alex was better at poaching surgeries, George would have been better at dealing with emergency cases while Alex would just have frozen (e.g. heart in the elevator). Later, when George's mother returned, which brings back memories of George, Alex revealed to Cristina and Meredith that he didn't like to think of George because it reminded him of Izzie (his ex-wife) which brought pain.\n\nOver the years, Alex's views on George softened. When Meredith, Callie, and Alex were discussing all of the different doctors that lived in Meredith's house, George was brought up and Alex made a somber toast in his honor, showing that he truly did see him as a friend.\n\n\nDuring his intern year, Alex notably had a reputation for getting on the bad side of his attendings and other staff. and laissez-faire in dealing with patients, earning him the reprimand of Chief Webber. Dr. Shepherd once kicked him out of the O.R. for asking if their critically ill patient who had to be taken back for surgery could count as his second surgery and Dr. Hunt called him out several times for his lack of bedside manners.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nArizona is Alex's mentor and the two have maintained a close relationship because of that. Arizona is one of the only people who fully believes in Alex's surgical abilities. When Alex had decided to take the fellowship at Johns Hopkins, Arizona was hurt and upset. As a result of this, she decided to take Alex's spot on the [[Flight|plane]] that eventually crashed. As a result of this plane crash, Arizona lost her leg. At first, Alex worried that she blamed him as he was supposed to be in her spot. But this was not the case and Arizona and Alex continued to work well together.\n\nArizona also supported his decision to work for [[Oliver Lebackes]] and helped him after he ran into problems there.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhen acclaimed plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan took up a position at Seattle Grace, Alex leapt at the chance to pursue his interest in plastics. He wanted Addison to release him from her service, and she did. It becomes clear that Mark is a poor teacher, only delegating menial tasks to Alex. Alex gradually developed distaste for plastics after serving as Mark's intern, and found himself drawn back to Addison's surgeries.\n\nDuring the shooting, Mark, along with the help of Lexie, saved Alex's life after he was shot.\n\n\nAlex Karev is a former wrestler at [[University of Iowa]], and attended college on a wrestling scholarship.\n\nAlex prides himself on his honesty, which often lacks tact and can verge on being crude, brutal, and insensitive. This contributes to his poor bedside manner. However, Alex does have a moral code and is the only doctor who tells the truth to patients who make bad decisions about their health, at the risk of offending patients and getting kicked out of surgical cases.\n\nAlex is also the first intern to decide on his specialty \u [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]]. While it seemed at first that he chose that specialty due to \"frat-boy\" superficiality, the real reason was that plastic surgery patients \ucsign up for the pain they get\ud. He has unwittingly been drawn to [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|obstetrics and gynecology]] and [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]], after having several bad experiences in plastics, under Mark Sloan. Alex seems to have some talent in OB/GYN after serving as Addison's intern for a while.\n\nAlex Karev secured a position in the surgical residency program at Seattle Grace after graduating from medical school. Although first he was an intern of Jeremy, Alex was reassigned to a new resident [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]], to the disdain of the other interns under her. His frequent sexist remarks and overt come-ons made him even more disliked by the interns, who proceeded to dub him \ucevil spawn\ud. He became even more hated when he hijacked an open-heart surgery that rightfully belonged to the other interns. After which, he proceeded to taunt a furious Meredith, who attacked him in retaliation, calling him a \ucfrat boy bitch\ud.\n\nAlex confided in Meredith about his failed medical boards and she decided to help him study, roping in Cristina and George to help as well.\n\nAlex's streak of brutal honesty caused Addison to be on the receiving end of legal action, when he persuaded a patient's husband to sue the hospital for Addison's \ucmistake\ud in \ucBlue's for Sister Someone\ud. Furious, she informs a stunned Alex that he would be placed permanently under her service. Despite his lack of interest in obstetrics and gynecology, he has exhibited some flair for it as he managed to deliver a premature baby by himself.\n\nWhen acclaimed [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgeon]] Dr. [[Mark Sloan]] took up a position at Seattle Grace, Alex leapt at the chance to pursue his interest in plastics. He wanted Addison to release him from her service, and she did, but not before telling him that he would miss her. It becomes clear that Mark is a poor teacher, only delegating menial tasks to Alex. Alex gradually developed distaste for plastics after serving as Mark's intern, and found himself drawn back to Addison's surgeries. Addison left Seattle Grace and Alex found himself without any preferences for any specialty.\n\nWhen Rebecca Pope returned to Seattle Grace and revealed she was pregnant, Alex took up some shifts at the [[Emerald City Bar]].\n\nWhen Cristina was chosen to pick the first resident to perform a solo surgery, she chose Alex who performed a below the knee amputation.\n\nIt was during Alex's third year of residency that he heavily considered [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]] as a specialty. Given his time as Addison's intern, and with Bailey's recommendation, [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Pediatric Surgery [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]] mentored Alex for the remainder of his residency; he officially declared his specialty during his fifth year, paving the way for his [[Fellow|fellowships]] after his residency.\n\nAlex was [[Owen Hunt|Owen's]] original choice for chief resident but after he sold out\ua[[Meredith Grey|Meredith]]\uawhen she tampered with the Alzheimer's trial,\ua[[Owen Hunt|Owen]]\uachose\ua[[April Kepner]]\uainstead.\n\nAlex passed his [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|oral boards]] and is a [[Board Certification|board certified surgeon]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|general surgery]] and completed a pediatric surgical fellowship at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] after turning down a fellowship at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]]. He then joined [[Lebackes Pediatric Surgery Clinic]], a private practice, as a new partner under practice director [[Oliver Lebackes|Dr. Oliver Lebackes]].\n\nWhen Cristina transferred her hospital shares to Alex, he considered sitting on the board of [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Unfortunately, the board unanimously voted for Bailey to take Cristina's seat, but hired Alex as an attending pediatric surgeon, especially as [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] needed to focus on her new fellowship in [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]].\n\nSometime after Robbins was promoted to the head of fetal surgery and Bailey was promoted to [[Chief of Surgery]], Alex was promoted to Robbins' old position as department head of pediatric surgery. Alex was then temporarily demoted to staff physician at the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]] when he was suspended. When his charges were dropped sometime later, Bailey reinstated Alex back to the surgical staff as the pediatric surgery head.\n\nAfter being fired by Bailey for his part in Meredith's insurance fraud, Alex was hired as Chief of Staff and Chief of Surgery at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]].\n\n\n*Alex Karev was not in the original pilot script. He wasn't added until after the pilot was shot. Therefore, scenes with him were either reshoots or digitally altered to include him.\n*His uncle is a rodeo cowboy.<ref>[[Superstition]], x</ref>\n*When discussing medical proxies, Alex told Cristina she could be his proxy.

The name associated with the date of birth in the divorce papers sent by Izzie is never seen.\ua\n**However, Alex is later seen in what is specified to be , as a high school student, in [[Old Scars, Future Hearts]] and he appears closer to being a senior than . Though if he were to be a senior (and thus born in approximately ), this would also contradict [[Callie Torres|Callie]]'s words that imply he is in his twenties in the third season. \n*Alex is the only one of the  original interns and remaining residents of his class to have gone into private practice, albeit briefly, after their training was complete.\n*Alex gives blood every two months.<ref>[[I Saw What I Saw]], x</ref>\n*He used to laugh in his sleep.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n*He used to braid Amber's hair when she was younger.<ref>[[Only Mama Knows]], x</ref>\n*Alex wrote an essay explaining that he got bad grades in medical school due to testicular cancer. He even claimed he lost a testicle which turned out to be false.\n*Alex wears a personalized scrub cap that is a mix of silver and brown seemingly stylized in a marble-wood fashion.\n*Alex has had sex with doctors in all stages of education: a medical student ([[Laurel Pinson]]),\uaseveral interns (such as\ua[[Leah Murphy]]\uaand\ua[[Heather Brooks]]), several residents (such as\ua[[Izzie Stevens]]\uaand\ua[[Jo Wilson|Jo Wilson]]), a fellow ([[Lucy Fields]]), and an attending ([[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Montgomery]]).\n*Alex was promoted off-screen to the [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]] some time after [[Walking Tall]] as he does not mention himself as a department head when [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], [[Callie Torres|Callie]], [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], and [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] were pointed out as heads of their respective departments.\n*Alex was confirmed as the department head of pediatric surgery in the show's dialogue only after he was suspended and pending conviction.

Arizona was laughing due to shock, but stopped abruptly when Jerry told her that he couldn't feel his legs.\n\nWhen Cristina came back to splint Arizona's leg, she sent Cristina to stabilize Jerry's C-spine. Jerry managed to release his seatbelt while he told Cristina and Arizona that it should be not more than four hours before they were found. Cristina used a board and some tape from the plane to stabilize his head and neck. He instructed her on where to find things and then asked her if he was paralyzed or if he'd walk again. She took a pen and jabbed it into his leg. When he had no reaction, she apologized.\n\nWhile they were out in the woods, Jerry heard a helicopter. He told the doctors to fire the flare gun, but it didn't fire properly and the helicopter left. After the sun set, Jerry said that the transmitter had probably been damaged in the crash, meaning that no one knew where they were.\n\nIt was later confirmed during a meeting about the lawsuit that Jerry is paralyzed.\n\n\n\nAfter spending four days in the woods with Jerry, the doctors bonded with him somewhat and when they were discussing who would be sued, they were firmly opposed to suing Jerry, despite their rep's insistence that they needed to stop seeing Jerry as one of them.

Steve had his first parentless Halloween in . He trick-or-treated with his sister. It was dusk and drizzling and they decided to go to Mr. C's house. Mr. C lived down the street from them and was famous for two things--dentures and the Halloween house. Each year he transformed his colonial style home into a haunted-palooza, and himself into Monster C. Steve had a longstanding theory that Monster C was simply Mr. C sans the dentures. And as a young scientist/future doctor he was excited to check out the inside of his mouth and the state of his toothless gums. However, he opened the door as a full-toothed bizarro version of Bozo the Clown popped out from the spider web, frizzy red hair and all. And it was then that they realized that the \"C\" in Monster C stood for clown. Cindy was afraid of clowns and ran screaming from the house. He claimed not to be afraid, but he ran with Cindy. Unfortunately, a boy named Mitch Donovan, who was egging Mr. C's car, saw them and continued to call Steve, ''Scarecrow Steve'' all the way through high school.\n\n\nOn his first day, he was assigned to [[Cristina Yang]]. Cristina took the group on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules. However, her speech was derailed when her pager didn't go off as she told the interns to move when she moves.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nSteve worked in the clinic for a day. He asked if they'd get to do any procedures on their own, but Bailey said they would not. ''(\"[[Love/Addiction]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nMegan told Steve that Henry, presumably another intern, was observing in [[Tricia Hale|Tricia Hale's]] surgery when Mark Sloan announced to the whole OR that [[Izzie Stevens]] and [[George O'Malley]] had broken up. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the navigational computer broke while [[Mary Daltrey]] was having surgery, Derek sent Steve to go to the desk and ask anyone if they knew anything about computers. Nobody came, so Steve went back. Steve later held the probe steady while Derek helped Rose fix the computer. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina was stabbed by an icicle, Steve and [[Dani Mandvi|Dani]] treated her, though she berated them because they didn't know how to read the x-ray. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nSteve was given an epidural so they could practice that. They forgot to put in a catheter when they did it, so he peed himself. They suggested they could take out his appendix as practice, but he refused. He was then confined to a bed until it wore off. Steve was later put on probation with all the other interns. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting outside an on-call room trying to get some sleep, Dani, Steve, and Ryan heard a loud, painful moan when Mark broke his penis. Later, while they watched his surgery, they gossiped about who might have broken it. Sadie eventually confessed, despite it actually being Lexie. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Warren Kramer]] came into the ER with an object lodged in his rectum, Steve, Pierce, and Ryan all laughed over his predicament. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. Steve, Ryan, and Lexie reached the finish line at the same time, but Lexie gave the correct diagnosis, so she was declared the winner. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended Alex and Izzie's wedding. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen George died, Steve attended the funeral. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program. He survived the first round of layoffs. He told Lexie Grey that while he was safe, [[Megan Nowland]] was cut. Megan was pregnant with his child.\ua''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thatcher Grey]] came in in need of a liver, Steve drew some of Lexie's blood to see if she was a match. ''(\"[[Tainted Obligation]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Derek was looking for someone who was a natural at microsurgery, Steve gave it a shot, but failed. ''(\"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\")''\n\n\nSteve participated in the documentary someone was making about doctors from the hospital. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nSteve attended a party thrown by Derek at [[Meredith's House]]. ''(\"[[Shiny Happy People]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the hospital shooting, Steve was among the doctors locked down in peds. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] got funding to do a special trauma certification for the residents, Steve assisted him, helping him set up and handing out cards with symptoms. ''(\"[[That's Me Trying]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Megan Nowland]]\nDuring [[Pierce Halley|Pierce]] and [[Megan Nowland|Megan's]] break, Megan slept with Steve and Steve accidentally sent an email to people about their hookup, including Pierce. According to [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]], Pierce wants to kill Steve, and Steve loves Megan, but it appears that Steve has punched Pierce, with Pierce having a black eye and Steve having a bloody hand. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\nSteve was married to Megan, by his uncle, at the back of the hospital, with [[Graciella Guzman]] as a witness. But however, he found out that Megan actually did a paternity test, without his knowledge. While Megan opened the envelope containing the results, he got into a fight with Pierce. Despite finding out that Megan's baby was actually his, he divorced her. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\nGirlfriend\nLater, Steve mentioned a new girlfriend while operating. ''(\"[[All You Need is Love]]\")''\n\n\nSteve got on with all interns and used to get on with [[Pierce Halley|Pierce]] before his break-up with [[Megan Nowland|Megan]]. When [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] was stabbed with an icicle he (and the other interns) took pictures on his phone. He is one of the many who loves [[Joe]] and [[Emerald City Bar]].\n\nAt Halloween, Dr. Yang informed the interns that they were to dress up for Halloween, so Steve bought a clown costume. He expected Cristina to be impressed but when she wasn't, he came to the conclusion that she had a fear of clowns.\n\n\nSteve was one of [[Cristina Yang|Cristina Yang's]] [[Internship|interns]]. When Cristina was stabbed, he could not read the [[Medical Glossary#X|X-ray]] as he said she always read them.\n\nSteve was part of the intern group that [[In the Midnight Hour|operated on themselves]], however, Steve specifically was not present during the surgery, as he had been given an epidural a few hours prior and was unable to walk, and had also wet himself. He is an aspiring neurosurgeon. His favorite surgery that he scrubbed in on was a craniotomy with [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]] when he held a probe inside someone\us brain.\n\nSteve is one of the better interns, in Izzie's ''intern bowl'', he tied for second with [[Ryan Spalding]] and just lost to [[Lexie Grey]].\n\nSteve became a second year [[Resident|resident]] and survived the first round of layoffs when [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] merged with [[Mercy West Medical Center]].\n\n\n*Steve had an [http://blogs.abc.com/internsteve/about.html official blog], which has since been removed.\n*He doesn't like dead people.<ref>[[Invasion]], x</ref>\n*His favorite color is light blue.\n*He dressed as a clown for Halloween.<ref>[[Haunt You Every Day]], x</ref>\n*His talents include board games, suturing fruit, Guitar and Mini-Golf\n*His nd favorite Seattle location is Pike Place Market (a.k.a.

The propeller pulled her in, and both her arms were neatly amputated and were retrieved from the water by Jasmine. Her right leg was also hanging on by a thread. In the ER, Mark said the amputations were clean and the arms could be re-attached.\n\n\nAfter dropping off her backpack, her traveling buddies left while she was in surgery to catch a concert in Las Vegas. Knowing that she would need the support during her recovery, [[Cristina Yang]] ordered [[Lexie Grey]] to befriend Clara and become her support system. Meanwhile, Jasmine and Jo constantly sent Clara postcards of their travels. Clara also refused to tell her mother, who was in London, about her situation and instead lied to her through her e-mails for weeks by telling her about her fake travels, because she didn't want the woman who \"built her from scratch\" to know how badly she was hurt.\n\n\nWhile her arms were reattached, she was unable to move them for days. Clara became depressed when moving her fingers slightly was a big accomplishment. She told Lexie they should have let her die. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\nClara later told Lexie she was doing better and she could call off the suicide watch. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nClara was told she had an infection in her small bowel and her colon was inflamed, meaning she needed another surgery. She refused surgery because she didn't want to be cut open again. It was the only option. When Lexie read an email she'd composed to Clara's mother, telling her everything that happened, saying that she'd either page the doctors for surgery or hit send, Clara let them take her into surgery. The infection had worsened because of the delay, but they were able to remove a portion of her bowel and she was taken to recovery. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nAfter she recovered from her surgery, Clara was fitted with a prosthetic and [[Jon]], a physical therapist, came in to get her up and trying to walk again. She resisted physical therapy. After Jon said that this is where the hard part begins, she refused to continue and wouldn't allow any further sessions. Owen wanted to call for a psych consult, but Lexie said they were calling her ceviche and she couldn't go out like that. She laughed and acknowledged that that was horrible. She then allowed Jon to come back. They got her up and she was able to take a few steps on her prosthetic. She then told Lexie to call her mother. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\n\nHer mother always told her that she'd made her body from scratch, trying to get her to be more careful with herself. As a result, when she was hospitalized, she didn't call her mother.

They had an idea to use frequency waves to treat shatter her tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue, but while they developed the technology, she had to have more radiation and chemotherapy to treat the cancer. Even though she knew she'd be bald by fall with chemotherapy and radiation, she kept a smile on her face, despite wanting to be able to audition for a musical and beat out Susie Oppenheimer. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nThe doctors continued their research to look for a cure for Kimmie as she continued to deteriorate. Despite her failing health, Kimmie didn't lose hope and still happily sang in her hospital room with Alex and debated the best musicals with [[Tom Koracick]]. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\nWhile undergoing chemotherapy, Kimmie had trouble keeping any food down, so they wanted to place an NG tube. Kimmie didn't want that, so she asked for medical marijuana in the form of oil instead. She said it had been Peg's idea. Alex got the paperwork filled out to get the use approved, but when he went to Peg about it, she was against it, because both Kimmie's parents had been addicted. She fired Alex and decided she wanted to move Kimmie to another hospital for treatment. However, Alex went to her personally and explained to her the benefits of using medical marijuana over conventional medicine. She agreed and Kimmie was given the oil, which greatly helped her nausea. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nKimmie began to lose hope as she continued her treatment. After treating [[Noah Brosniak|Noah]] with the laser treatment, Tom and Amelia decided Kimmie couldn't wait for it to be honed to work for her type of tumor and decided to develop a treatment plan that would allow her to live until summer, when Tom would take her and Peg to New York and see as many Broadway shows as they could before she died. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\nKimmie decided to go with her grandma to New York to see all the shows she could in her final weeks. She wanted to watch them live and immerse in the experience rather than watching them on her laptop. Alex opposed to this as he wanted to see her survive, but she left with her grandmother while he was in surgery. They ran into Jo and asked her to let him know, specifically requesting she tell him that she was smiling as she left. ''(\uc[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\ud)''\n\n\n\nHer birth parents never took an interest in her, so she was raised by [[Peg]], her grandmother.\n\n\nKimmie had a friend that invited her to come to New York with her and her family during summer.\n\n\n*She was  years old at the time of her recurrence.\n*Her CT scan incorrectly shows\uaher name as Kimmie Sullivan.\n*She likes peanut butter on top of ice cream.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxKimmiePark.png|[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\nxKimmiePark.png|[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\nxKimmiePark.png|[[Games People Play]]\nxKimmiePark.png|[[Hold Back the River]]\nxKimmiePark.png|[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Kimmie Park Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Kimmie Park]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Park, Kimmie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

However, when she found out that he does wood carvings in his spare time, she developed a plan that would allow him to keep his fingers. While she was operating, Carl went into cardiac tamponade. Cristina came into the OR and diagnosed an aortic dissection, which Callie deduced was the reason why he fell off the truck in the first place. His heart was repaired in surgery while Callie continued to work on his hand.\n\nAfter surgery, Carl was pleased to see all of his fingers still attached.

He told them not to go for help, fearing that they'd be split up, but [[Sarah (House Where Nobody Lives)|Sarah]] believed he was dying and showed Jack where Joey was. When they said Joey needed to go to the hospital, Joey objected, but when he became unresponsive, they took him anyway. They told his siblings where the hospital was and said they could run and meet the ambulance there. ''(\"[[House Where Nobody Lives]]\")''\n\nJoey became agitated when he learned that his siblings had been taken back into foster care. He tried to leave the hospital, but Jo caught him and told him explicitly what could happen if he tried to leave before he got treatment in order to convince him to stay. He later had surgery on his arm. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, Joey was reluctant to do his PT. Cormac initially thought he was bored by it, so he brought in a video game that used the same motions and said he could play that instead. He told them he couldn't play video games or enjoy being safe and warm without knowing his siblings were okay, too. Bailey then made some calls and arranged for his siblings to come to the hospital for pizza and video games, which reassured him greatly. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\nWhile Joey was hospitalized, Bailey helped him study and they bonded. He also turned eighteen, but declined to meet with his social worker to discuss his options for continued foster care or group homes. Upset that he was being discharged during a blizzard with nowhere to go, Bailey invited him to come to her house and stay with her family, which he accepted. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\nJoey continued to live with them happily. ''(\"[[Leave a Light On]]\")''\n\n\nBen came home after a long shift to find Joey and Tuck playing basketball together. He then joined their game. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n\nJoey and Tuck came with Bailey to the spaghetti dinner fundraiser to help raise money for Pruitt's funeral. They ate voraciously, then discussed their mutual desire to go down the fire pole, which Ben said they couldn't do. When they cleared their plates, they asked if they could go get more, which Ben said they could. ''(\"[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\")''\n\n\nAt the start of the Covid- pandemic, Ben's sister Rosalind came to live at her brother's house to watch Tuck and Joey while Ben and Bailey both quarantined due to their work. Both boys enjoyed this change and wanted Rosalind to continue to stay with them. Rosalind brought them down to the hospital one evening to clap for the healthcare workers at the hospital along with the firefighters of station . ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")'' ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Lorelei]] the tiger escaped into Seattle and was eventually trapped in the barn at station , Tuck and Joey FaceTimed Ben so they could see her. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Elena Bailey died of COVID, Ben came home for the first time since the start of the pandemic, saying he'd tested negative and then breaking the bad news to both boys and Rosalind. Tuck lashed out, fleeing to his room and refusing to speak to anyone, even Joey. Ben made spaghetti to draw him out. Joey then sat down with Ben and they talked about having lost people before. Joey talked about the difficulty of being separated from his foster siblings and Ben offered to have a barbecue at the end of the pandemic and inviting all of them over. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd, protests cropped around the country, including many in Seattle. Joey and Tuck asked Ben if they could join the protests, saying they wanted to march for themselves and for Rosalind. Ben finally agreed and they marched along the rest of Station . ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station )|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Bailey found a lump in Ben's testicle that a urologist determined was most likely cancerous, Joey immediately took an interest in the surgery he'd need to have to remove his testicle and hopefully all the cancer. This conversation led to a discussion of Joey's future and if he wanted to go to medical school. When he expressed concern over the cost, Ben easily said they could help with that. ''(\"[[I Guess I'm Floating]]\")''\n\nWhile Ben had his orchiectomy, he dreamed that Joey was helping a version of Ben himself operate. ''(\"[[Comfortably Numb]]\")''\n\n\nJoey shadowed Ben for a whole shift while he was on aid car to get an experience for his college essay. Their first call out was to an encampment like the one Joey had lived in prior to meeting Bailey. Joey quickly recognized their patient as [[Ameen Deng]], a friend of his with a heart condition. While Joey watched, Ben and Jack began treating Ameen. When he coded, Joey told them he was DNR, but without legal paperwork, Ben and Jack were forced to continue treatment over Joey's objections. The CPR was unsuccessful and Ben radioed to Grey Sloan to have a physician pronounce him dead remotely. The next day, near the end of the shift, Joey told Ben he'd finished his essay, which he'd written on the failure of emergency healthcare in the US. ''(\"[[Too Darn Hot]]\")''\n\n\nOne evening, while they were eating dinner amidst the dispute over Pru's custody, Ifeya called Bailey becuase Pru had woken up crying for her. With Joey and Ben's help, Bailey was able to soothe Pru to sleep over the phone. ''(\"[[A House Is Not a Home]]\")''\n\nWhen Ifeya and Bill agreed to allow Pru to live with Ben and Bailey, Joey happily helped them welcome her home. To help nurture her Nigerian culture, Joey found a Nigerian grocery nearby and began cooking with ingredients found there. ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\n\nJoey attended the party Ben and Bailey threw at the station for Pru. ''(\"[[Crawl Out Through the Fallout]]\")''\n\n\nOn Halloween, Joey brought Pru to the Station  open house. He dressed as a referee while Pru was Megan Rapinoe, a change from the firefighter costume she'd originally planned to wear. ''(\"[[Demons]]\")''\n\n\n\nAfter his parents died in a car accident when he was five, he ended up in foster care. After several years, he was placed in a house with [[Frank]], [[Sarah (House Where Nobody Lives)|Sarah]], and [[Ernie (House Where Nobody Lives)|Ernie]]. When their foster father was arrested, they ran away together and started living on the streets. They were split up again when Joey was hospitalized and social services was called for the other three.

At the hospital, all the Chief candidates tried to suck up to him. He said that he'd vote for whichever of them fixed his problem and showed them his severely swollen testicles. He hadn't urinated in three days. They called urology to put in a supra-pubic catheter to drain his bladder and got an ultrasound and x-ray to determine the cause.\n\nThe x-ray showed what looked like a skeleton in his penis. Webber came in and said it was a candiru fish, which is known for swimming up streams of urine and lodging itself in the urethra. He was taken into surgery where the fish was removed and the damage to his bladder was repaired. During his surgery, he had a heart issue, so Burke monitored his heart while they operated. The surgery was successful and he was stable and awake afterward. ''(\"[[Desire]]\")''\n\n\nLarry went to Derek and said the board was meeting soon. He said he needed to know if Derek wanted to be Chief. Later, when he saw [[Callie Torres]] yelling at Richard on the catwalk, he made a disparaging comment about Richard's control of the hospital. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nLarry and the rest of the board started having secret meetings, drawing suspicion from the doctors in the hospital. Not longer after that, the announcement was made that [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] would be merging. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Cathy Becker]] died under suspicious circumstances, Larry, [[Richard Webber]], and a lawyer interviewed all the doctors who had worked in the ER that evening, trying to piece together exactly what went wrong. ''(\"[[I Saw What I Saw]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the Andersons pledged a $ million donation to the hospital, Jennings and Webber pressured [[Arizona Robbins]] into doing a surgery on [[Wallace Anderson]] that she didn't believe he was strong enough to survive. When Wallace later died, Jennings tried to suck up to the Andersons, but he was informed that Arizona was the reason they'd still be donating the money, not him. ''(\"[[Invest in Love]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard started drinking again, [[Meredith Grey]] eventually let Derek go to the board and Larry, along with a few others, confronted him about his alcohol abuse. ''(\"[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]\")''\n\nRichard was presented with two options: either he could take early retirement and relinquish his medical license or he could go to rehab and get his job back when he was done, pending board approval. He said he needed time to think. He ultimately decided to go to rehab. ''(\"[[State of Love and Trust]]\")''\n\n\nLarry was called in when Derek's Alzheimer's trial was compromised. He told Derek that Richard had confessed to tampering with the trial, letting Meredith off the hook.

His assistant claimed that it was true love and their love was very rare and it was a bonus that they could work and play together although it bothered her that he hadn't left his wife, even after five years. His wife later showed up at the hospital and revealed she always knew about the affair. Larry's assistant quit and left Larry. His wife did the same.

''(\"[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\")''\n\nShe hated high school, which she attributes to cheerleaders. ''(\"[[All Eyez on Me]]\")''\n\n\nPenny was one of the doctors who tended to Derek Shepherd when he came into the Dillard ER. She put in his chest tube and his thoughts indicated that he liked her, said she was smart. She wanted to order a head CT, but [[Paul Castello]] insisted that they didn't have time and they needed to take him into surgery to get his abdominal bleeding under control.\n\nWhile they were on the way to the OR, she made one final plea to get the CT, since he was stable. Paul again declined and they took Derek into surgery and started operating. When he became unstable, Paul finally remembered that he'd had a head laceration and had the anesthesiologist check his eyes, which revealed a blown right pupil. They paged the neurosurgeon, [[Dr. Cohn]], who said he'd be there in  minutes because he was at a dinner. Despite this, it took him an hour and a half to arrive. Penny called him out on this and he responded that they should have gotten a head CT and they would have paged him sooner. When she continued to say that he should have gotten there faster because Derek might have had a chance if he had, he kicked her out of the OR.\n\nShe went with Dr. Cohn to speak to Meredith about Derek's death and Meredith told them that the decision not to get a CT was a bad decision.\n\nWhen Meredith exited the hospital, Penny was on a bench outside crying. She went up to Meredith to apologize again, but Meredith told her that Derek was her one, the patient whose face she'll see every time she treats a patient. He'll haunt her and remind her that he died on her watch. It'll either make her a better doctor or she'll quit and Meredith says she doesn't get to spend what would have been the rest of Derek's life being a quitter and then sends her back inside because she's not saving any lives outside. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n\nLong after Derek's death, Penny began seeing [[Callie Torres]]. They dated for a while and Callie invited Penny to come to a dinner party at Meredith's with her. She and Meredith were both shocked to see each other when Callie and Penny arrived at the party. Penny did not know that Callie was good friends with Derek and Meredith and Callie did not know about Penny being a resident at the hospital Derek died in. ''(\"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\")''\n\nPenny tried repeatedly to get Callie to let them leave the party, but Callie, thinking it was just nerves about meeting Arizona and her other friends, insisted that Penny stay, even when Callie herself got called to the hospital. Meredith kept quiet about the connection to Penny, but it came out when Penny was asked about why she was transferring to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. The doctors were all shocked by the news and Penny left the house. Later, after coming back in to use the bathroom, Penny met up with Meredith, who had come back downstairs after going up to hide in her bedroom. Penny said she'd ask for a transfer so they wouldn't have to work together, but Meredith told her that she'd see her on Monday and not to be late. ''(\"[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\")''\n\n\nOn her first day at GSM, Penny was assigned to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] service. She helped Meredith treat [[Robert Matthews]], but Meredith critiqued her every step of the way and eventually kicked her off her service. However, after speaking to Richard, Meredith agreed to give Penny another chance and asked for her on her service for the rest of the week. ''(\"[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith continued to have Penny on her service, running her ragged. Penny eventually confronted Meredith, saying that she could hate her, but she hadn't let Penny quit, so she shouldn't quit either. And if Meredith wasn't going to teach her, she should let her go. Meredith later let her help with a kidney transplant. ''(\"[[Something Against You]]\")''\n\n\nPenny found Meredith after she was attacked by [[Lou]]. She helped treat her initial injuries and then followed her recovery. When Meredith had a panic attack after a visit with her kids didn't go well, Penny cut the wires holding the broken jaw together. Jackson yelled at her for it, but she defended that Meredith needed air and her jaw could be re-wired the next morning. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] came into the ER, Penny was given the case because of her relationship with Callie. However, she hadn't yet met Sofia. When Callie found out that Penny had treated Sofia without paging her, she claimed that Arizona wasn't comfortable with Penny meeting Sofia yet. Penny immediately went to Arizona to apologize, but Arizona said that she had no part in it and Callie had lied. Penny believed it was because she'd told Callie she loved her the previous night. Callie later told Penny they were on the same page and invited her to get ice cream with her and Sofia. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the opportunity came up for Penny to apply for the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]], she initially decided she didn't want to because she believed she didn't have a chance at it. However, she ultimately decided to apply after overhearing other residents dismissing her. She had support of several attendings and was given the grant, which funds a year of residential research at the Preminger Research Center. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\nWhen the time came to say whether or not she was accepting the grant, Penny consulted with Callie, not wanting to make a decision without talking to her first. After talking, they decided they'd both go to New York. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\n\nPenny testified on Callie's behalf at the hearing to determine who would receive custody of Sofia. Despite being flustered and unable to remember what grade Sofia was in or what she'd been wearing that day, she demonstrated knowledge of Sofia's likes and routine. After Arizona was awarded sole custody of Sofia, Penny tried to comfort Callie, but Callie pulled away from her. ''(\"[[Mama Tried]]\")''\n\n\nPenny wanted to delay her move to New York because Callie wouldn't be able to join her with Sofia. However, Callie told her it would just delay the inevitable resentment and broken promises if they tried long distance and they ended things. Penny then packed up her things and told Meredith she was accelerating her departure. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nPenny was dating Callie Torres. She was not aware of Callie's friendship with Meredith Grey until Callie brought her to a dinner party at [[Meredith's House]]. ''(\"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\")''\n\nAfter the dinner party, they didn't speak for a few days because Penny thought Callie was taking Meredith's side, though Callie said she was on both sides. However, after Penny's first day at Grey Sloan Memorial, they both agreed they were in it. ''(\"[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\")''\n\nPenny constantly being on Meredith's service upset Callie, which strained their relationship. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\nThey broke up briefly, but they met in a stairwell at work and Callie admitted to Penny that she missed her and Penny kissed her. ''(\"[[All I Want is You]]\")''\n\nOne night, as they were in bed getting ready to sleep, Penny told Callie she loved her. Callie replied, \"Thank you.\" The next day, after Penny treated Sofia, Callie told her that she was on the same page and she'd been there for a while, but she had a history of being on that page too early in the past, which is why she was hesitant. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\nWhen Penny won the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]], which would require moving to New York for a year, she didn't ask Callie to go with her, feeling it wasn't possible. However, Callie told her to do it and they decided to move to New York together with Sofia. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\nWhen Callie lost the case for sole custody, things quickly soured between her and Penny. Penny told Callie she wanted to wait to leave until things were good between them again, but Callie said it wouldn't work because she couldn't leave without Sofia and long-distance would fizzle out quickly. When Penny asked if they were breaking up, Callie said it would be best to end things now instead of dragging it out. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\nAfter Penny left, Callie was miserable, which led Arizona to decide to allow Callie to take Sofia to New York with her and have her for a greater part of the year, leading Callie to move to New York to be with Penny again. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\nThey broke up an undetermined time later, revealed when Arizona comments that she and Callie are both single and making each other smile again. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nHer mother is a petroleum seismologist, so they moved every two years.\n\n\nAfter starting work at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], Penny began to bond with the other residents, particularly [[Stephanie Edwards]], [[Jo Wilson]], and [[Ben Warren]].\n\n\n[[Paul Castello]]\nPaul, one of her co-workers, seemed to have little respect for her. Over her objections, he refused to take Derek for the head CT that might have saved his life. Derek's thoughts said that Paul didn't like Penny because she was smarter than him, even though she's younger, and probably because she's a woman. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nPenny had a rough start with Meredith during her first days at Grey Sloan Memorial. She was put under Meredith's service\uadespite hating her for \"killing Derek\". Meredith was asking her questions about procedures while they work on\ua[[Robert Matthews]]\uabut was being intimidated by her, being unable to answer her questions.\ua''(\"[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\")''\n\nAfter being reprimanded by Webber, Meredith started trusting Penny with procedures. However, she was giving her a lot of workload, causing Penny to call Meredith out.\ua''(\"[[Something Against You]]\")''\n\nPenny was seen talking to Meredith while they were on their way to save\ua[[Brian Carson]], seemingly asking to join the team but\ua[[Jo Wilson]]\uawas already going.\ua''(\"[[All Eyez on Me]]\")''\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nWhen Penny was hired to work at GSM, Amelia refused to work with her. However, they were forced to work together when [[Richard Webber]] scrambled the attending/resident pairs. After seeing Penny work on [[Griffin McColl]], Amelia admitted that she was a born neurosurgeon, which meant Amelia would have to start teaching her.\ua''(\"[[Odd Man Out]]\")''\n\n\nPenny was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Dillard Medical Center]]. However, when Dillard closed, she was [[Resident#Re-Matching|re-matched]] to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to continue her residency. She's currently represents [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] at the Preminger Research Center.\n\n\n*Although her name was not mentioned in [[How to Save a Life]], closed captioning and subtitles displayed her name as Edie, however, she was re-introduced in [[Old Time Rock and Roll]] as [[Callie Torres|Callie's]] girlfriend named Penny.\n*She was in college before she ever tried macaroni and cheese.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n*She liked physics.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxPenny.png|[[How to Save a Life]]\nxPenny.png|[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[Something Against You]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[The Sound of Silence]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[All I Want is You]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[My Next Life]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[All Eyez on Me]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Odd Man Out]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[I Wear the Face]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[There's a Fine, Fine Line]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Trigger Happy]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Mama Tried]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[At Last]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Penelope Blake Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Penny Blake]]\n[[de:Penelope Blake]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blake, Penelope}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

You can say no, but I will badger you until you say yes.|'''Shane Ross''' to '''[[Cristina Yang]]'''}}\n\n'''Shane Ross''' is a resident at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] under [[Cristina Yang]]. He was previously a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Shane's life before his internship. He does not tell anything about his early life.\n\n\nShane was one of the new interns brought into the program along with [[Jo Wilson]], [[Stephanie Edwards]], [[Leah Murphy]], and [[Heather Brooks]].\n\nWhen Cristina was in the hospital, he and Heather stood outside her hospital room and talked about her until she threw a vase at the window to scare them off.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nHe was part of the group of interns who listened outside the on-call room while Bailey was in there with Ben.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nHe favored [[Neurosurgery]] and was constantly on [[Derek Shepherd|Derek Shepherd's]] service. When attending a skills lab taught by Derek on inserting central lines, he continuously interrupted the lecture to ask Derek about a chordoma Derek had removed in .<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Cristina came back from Minnesota, she dubbed him \"Happy\" and then \"Dopey.\" After working with her a little bit, he decided that he liked her.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nWhen he cried when they had to deliver the news that he was dying to [[Graham Cunningham]], Cristina coached him not to get emotional in front of the patients.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n\nShane was excited to work in outpatient surgery with April despite the other interns' reluctance to work with April, whom they had deemed, \"The dud.\" After a day of working with her, he and the other interns were lined up to compete to scrub in on the surgery to fix Derek's hand. Employing skills taught to him by April, Shane talked to Derek as if he were any other patient and reassured him, landing himself a spot on the team.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Derek's surgery, he had to play ping pong for his rehab and Shane played with him. Shane initially let Derek win, but when Derek offered him the chance to scrub in on a surgery if he won, Shane stopped letting Derek win.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Derek disliked the posters of him all around the hospital, he assigned Shane to deface all of them.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Derek was told that he needed to work with interns other than Shane, [[Heather Brooks]] was assigned to his service. After being impressed by her reflexes, he told Shane that he needed to spend some time on other services so he could get a more rounded surgical education. He blamed Heather for the change and told her he wasn't going quietly.<ref>[[Can't Fight This Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nEven after being reassigned to another service, Shane continued to check in on Shepherd's patients. Derek confronted him about this, saying he needed to find the specialty where he could shine.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the super storm, he was left to close Meredith's abdomen after her c-section. However, there was excessive bleeding. Shane had to re-open her abdomen and find the bleeding. He located the bleed in her spleen. Meredith talked him through the procedure until she passed out and he was left to finish the surgery without her help. [[Heather Brooks]] had gone for help and brought back [[Miranda Bailey]], who still hadn't operated since her MRSA scare, and she finished the surgery.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\n\nEven after having worked all day night during the superstorm, Shane helped out in the ER when the victims of the mudslide were brought in. While coming back with supplies, he met with Derek, who asked him to page Heather for him so she could take his patient to have scans taken. Soon after, Bailey asked Shane to go look for Dr. Webber. He met Heather on her way to the ER and told her Derek asked her to find Webber. Heather listened to him and took off to the basement. Shane himself\uatook Derek's patient to radiology for the scans. However, Derek insisted Heather did further examinations, but she was nowhere to be found. Shane went looking for her, only to find her electrocuted in the basement. Heather and Richard were taken up and Shane scrubbed in with Derek to operate on Heather's subdural bleed. Derek thanked Shane for having found her in time. He stayed silent about the fact that he sent Heather to find Richard. In the beginning of the surgery, Shane was optimistic she would make it, but this changed when Derek had to perform a temporal lobectomy, which would cause memory and motor deficits but save her life in the end. Shane then blurted out it was his fault, but Derek, who didn't get it, insisted it wasn't, convincing Shane to hold it together and continue operating with him.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the surgery, Heather started crashing. Derek ordered Shane to get Owen as he started CPR, but when Shane returned with Owen, Derek had given up CPR. Shane ran to the hallway to get some fresh air, where Jackson asked him how Heather was doing. Feeling guilty, Shane didn't reply and ran off. The interns got the night off to mourn her death, while Derek ordered them to stay in the hospital and wait for Heather's mother to arrive. They tried to come up with Heather stories to tell her mother, but a guilty Shane stayed silent all day. When Maura Brooks arrived and received the bad news, the interns took her to the locker room to clear out Heather's locker. Maura noticed how devastated Shane was when he started crying. She hugged him and guessed he must've been close with her daughter. At the end of the day, a depressed Shane decided to ride out with the firefighters to the mudslide, with the other interns deciding to come with him. They noticed he was extremely upset by Heather's death and wanted to show support, as they were all he had.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nA week later, Shane worked on Richard's case and distanced himself from the other interns, who started learning for their intern exam. Richard was refusing a feeding tube and Bailey let him refuse it. Shane didn't agree with this and contacted Meredith about it. She told him to be proactive and order the tube already, which he did. Richard and Bailey found out and Richard ordered to get him some soup. Shane noticed how difficult it was for Richard to swallow it. As Bailey and Meredith went to take another look at Richard's swallow studies, Shane entered Richard's room and got ready to place the tube. He named what could happen if Richard kept on refusing the tube. Shane was determined to place the tube, as he wouldn't let another person die. Offering to place the tube now instead of Meredith having to do it herself, Shane placed the tube, saving Richard's life. He did what had to be done.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the interns began all sleeping at Alex's house and studying. Jo was waiting for Alex to proposition her so they could have sex and Alex was waiting because he thought she was still grieving, so he said they could stay there as long as they wanted. Jo went to the others and said that they needed to leave.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nOn the night of the fundraising gala, Shane and Stephanie got to cover the ER solo. April warned them to call an attending if things would go over their heads. A couple of junkies were soon brought in, one of which developed serious heart defects. Shane was loving it all, calling it like whack-a-mole. Stephanie thought they needed help, but Shane said there wasn't anything they couldn't handle. Stephanie questioned this, but it was what they had been working towards all year. This was their shot and when another trauma was coming in, he asked Stephanie if she wanted to call for help or be a rock star. She joined him in choosing for the latter. The junkie tamponaded and Shane performed a pericardiocentesis on his own, still thinking of himself as a rock star. Stephanie got worried over the patient's condition and called Yang, who ordered to get Shane and the patient to the OR immediately. In the OR, Cristina complimented his courage and said he was a shark, which is a good thing as the best surgeons are. She allowed him to make the decisions in the OR and the surgery turned into a success. After the high of the surgery, Shane went back to the ER where Stephanie was cleaning up a trauma room. They agreed they were rock sharks and he kissed her, only to be pushed away by Stephanie as Jackson walked in. Shane just went back to work and enthusiastically started working on the victims of a multi-car mashup.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Shane worked on Richard's case again while also being on Meredith and Cristina's service, complimenting the latter's surgical skills. Meredith constantly used him to have messages delivered and when he reported back, he awkwardly turned away as Meredith was pumping. This made Meredith notice how awkward he could feel.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after having passed the intern exam, Shane discovered that there was accidentally made a personal lab coat for Heather Brooks. He stormed out, leaving the other residents wondering if something was wrong. He didn't say a word after the exam and didn't come to celebrate with them. Due to his guilt over Heather's death, Shane asked to be let off Derek's service after the day. Derek replied that he specifically requested him, as he wanted to make up for how he treated him earlier, when he constantly chose Heather. However, Shane switched services earlier when he proposed a very creative fix for Cristina's patient, suggesting they use glue used for brains to fix Cristina's patient's AVM. During the surgery with Cristina, she complimented him about the fix, saying he was full of surprises. At the end of the day, Shane purposefully burned his bridge with Derek when the latter asked him to scrub on [[Mickey Wenschler|Mickey's]] surgery. Shane refused to, leading to Derek telling him to get over the feeling of being second choice after Heather. Shane then clearly stated he did not want to work with Derek anymore. At the end of the day, when Stephanie tried to make it clear that their kiss didn't mean anything to her, he said he already forgot about it. He had just done in the heat of the moment and he pointed out that, contrary to him, she was still talking about it. She noticed how much he's changed and asked herself what happened to him.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nShane was reminded of Heather again on Halloween, when a patient kept on refusing to be examined by him as she wanted to wait for Dr. Brooks. Advised by Dr. Bailey, Shane didn't tell the patient Heather died and tried to find hospital records of the woman so he could start to treat her, but he couldn't find any. Stephanie pointed out to him that Heather used to help the unhoused and uninsured under the table. When the patient collapsed, she had no other option but to let Shane treat her. Shane even refused to scrub in on a surgery to stay with the woman. He then told the patient that Heather died a couple of months ago and she confirmed his suspicion that Heather treated her under the table. She didn't want to get Heather in trouble, which is why she wanted to wait for her. Shane gave her free asthma inhalers, like Heather used to, and promised her he would be her doctor from now on. When asked if he was as good as Dr. Brooks, he replied he wasn't, but he would be eventually.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he helped Heather's old patient on Halloween, Shane started concentrating on his work. While on Cristina's service, he read an article on an experimental procedure involving a -D printer and convinced her to try it on the deteriorating Glazier baby that had a serious heart defect. Cristina initially refused, because they would have to interrupt Meredith's research to use her -D printer, but Shane managed to convince her. They destroyed Meredith's model that was being printed in order for them to start printing.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile being on Cristina's service a lot to help on the Glazier case, Shane did more than just concentrating on his work. He was constantly drinking energy drinks to always be on the top of his game and acted quite rude to anyone that wasn't Cristina. He unnoticedly came into the patient room when Cristina told Alex she needed to have sex, as she's better at her job when she's getting laid. He informed her their conduit had failed and they needed to print another one. Seeing Meredith was supposed to have the printer according to the schedule that they worked out, Cristina had to tell her that they would need the printer longer. Noticing she didn't want to tell Meredith, Shane said he'd have Stephanie tell Meredith. He then told her he was available in case she wanted to get her \"yaya's\" out, just for the sake of the work. He complimented her looks, but Cristina declined. Shane harshly told Stephanie they would need the printer again, but in the evening, the conduit was flawed again. This meant they would need the printer for more time, again. When Meredith came to tell them she really needed the printer and kept on picking on Cristina for failing to modernize medicine with her flashy procedure, Shane came to Cristina's defense, saying it was enough now. He blankly yelled Meredith was making this professional issue about her friendship with Cristina, whom he says initially refused to do it because of that friendship. \"You'll get the printer tomorrow, doctor Grey!\" he yelled, forcing Meredith to leave. In return for standing up for her, Cristina kissed Shane.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, they started off a sexual relationship, with Shane constantly doing his best to please her in bed. On the day of the surgery on the Glazier baby, Shane offered the last two gallery seats to two of his fellow residents. Shane had the idea to film the entire surgery so other surgeons from all over the country could watch and learn. He hadn't told Cristina about this, as he made this executive decisions after having gotten emails from surgeons all over the country, but he offered her to veto any of the decision. However, she agreed to the plan. During the surgery, Shane brought in the -D printed conduit, which they successfully placed inside his body, though Nathan soon started crashing. Cristina ordered Shane to stop the cameras. After the surgery, Nathan was placed on an ocillator. Shane ended up in an elevator with Meredith. When asked how he was doing, he told her not to be smug. He acrimoniously congratulated her for her successful procedure, admitting that Meredith won and that he and Cristina lost. She tried to talk to him about the way he had been speaking to her lately, but he just walked off. Meredith went to talk to Cristina about Shane's changed behavior, but Cristina says he's just being focused on the work. Cristina was paged to Nathan's room, where she and Shane saw that Nathan had stabilized. They celebrated it with a little victory dance.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nShane figured out how to edit his hours in the system so he could make it look like he was working less than he actually was. He drank energy drinks to stay awake. While Cristina was at April's wedding, Jimmy Evans had a heart attack. Shane and Leah took him into surgery by themselves rather than call Cristina. While in surgery, Shane got in over his head. Leah sent someone away to call someone to help, but Shane continued to insist that he could do it. He snapped and referred to the patient as \"she,\" so Leah ran out of the OR herself to get someone. She brought back Richard, who managed to talk to Shane, who was having flashes back to when he told Heather to go find Richard in the basement, and get him to leave the OR while Richard tried to fix what Shane had done. Shane left the OR and appeared almost catatonic in the elevator as he left.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter leaving the OR during Jimmy's surgery, Shane went to a bench outside the hospital and fell asleep.\n\nThree weeks later, Shane came back to work. Owen assigned him to work with him. In surgery, Owen quizzed Shane on embryology. Over Richard's objections, he continued to ask questions, believing that Shane should know about it. When Shane apologized for not knowing the answer, Owen said that Shane should be apologizing to Jimmy's family and kicked him out of the OR.\n\nShane went to Alex to apologize, but Alex tackled him and started punching him in the face. Cristina and Meredith broke up the fight and Cristina took Shane to treat his wounds. He told Cristina that he was trying to make it right. He didn't believe he deserved to feel better. She agreed with him that he deserved for Alex to punch him. Then she told him that [[Ashley Glazier]] had sent her a photo of [[Nathan Glazier|Nathan]] with food all over his face. Normally, the photo would be annoying, but this one is miraculous. She said it was due to Shane having the idea and pushing her to do it that Ashley was even able to take that picture. It was a good decision and she tells him to make more of those going forward.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of who had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAt Richard's birthday party, Owen asked him to be director of the residency program because he noticed how well he'd been mentoring the residents.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nDerek, warned that he wasn't teaching enough, took all the residents to work on a case with him that he had rescheduled several times. As the OR wasn't available until  AM, he then took them to the ER to work on the incoming patients, including having them work on a patient who was already dead so they could work with real brain tissue. When a man came in with scissors puncturing his forehead, they took him into an OR for a controlled extraction. Then they went back to the case of [[Nova Jenkins]]. Each of the residents took a turn to step up to the microscope and ask a question so they could learn.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nShane worked with Cristina on her HLHS trial. He screened patients so that she only had to look at their hearts. When a patient came in who didn't meet the criteria for the trial, but who was desperate, he tried to talk to Cristina about her. However, Cristina was firm that she didn't qualify and told Shane that she wouldn't add the patient to the trial.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nWhen a virus was going around the hospital, Shane passed the conduit babies over to Stephanie because he was worried that he was sick and he didn't want to jeopardize the trial. In exchange, he agreed to take her weekend calls for a month and be her swap monkey for two months.<ref>[[You Be Illin']], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Cristina prepared to leave Seattle to move to Switzerland for her new job, Shane came to her and begged her to take him with her as he didn't want his education to stall and he wanted to continue to learn from her. She agreed to take him with her.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nShane is initially shown to be awkward, energetic, and passionate. He initially went out of his way to flatter the primary surgeons in order to receive attention, primarily from Derek Shepherd whom he idolizes. He has also been shown to be very passionate about his work and his patients. Shane was devastated when he was replaced on Derek's service by Heather Brooks. Even more so when he was told by Derek that hard work doesn't beat out natural talent. This had a big impact on Shane, since he had dreamed of following in Derek's footsteps. When Heather died, Shane felt deep regret and confessed this to Derek when they were operating on her.\n\nShane is well-liked around the hospital (by his fellow interns and the attendings). April and Derek have especially taken a liking to him. Derek has also noted that Shane is an extremely hard worker. He goes out of his way to please. However, as time progressed following Heather's death, Shane became more aggressive and disrespectful towards others, even the attendings. He showed ambition that rivaled Cristina's in her intern year (though lacking Cristina's innate talent), leading to her giving him the nickname \"Sharky\". While operating on [[Alex Karev|Alex's]] father, Shane had a psychiatric episode and became convinced that he was operating on [[Heather Brooks|Heather]].\n\n\n\n[[Stephanie Edwards]]\nHe kissed Stephanie after a long night in the ER with her. Jackson walked in just as she pushed him off. He later said that he just did in the moment, and forgot about it shortly after.

When [[Chief of Surgery|Chief]] [[Owen Hunt|Hunt]] forced Derek to mentor other interns, such as [[Heather Brooks]], Shane thought Heather wanted to steal neuro from him. He told her he wouldn't let her steal neuro from him without a fight. However, when he caused Heather's death, he decided not to chase neuro anymore due to his guilt over her death, and thereby (quite aggressively) declined when Derek offered him to scrub in on a neurosurgery.\n\nDuring the gala evening, Shane manned the ER with Stephanie. He performed a pericardiocentesis on his own, and eventually scrubbed in with Cristina to continue operating on the patient.

George told him that they did not want the help and left. Later, Carlos commended George for standing up to him and told him that he just wanted his daughter looked after. ''(\"[[My Favorite Mistake]]\")''\n\n\nHe returned later to see his daughter once more. Almost as soon as he arrived, he slammed George against the wall and asked why he shouldn't kill him for cheating on Callie. Callie quickly defended him by saying that she had cheated on him with Mark too so then he let George go and slammed [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] up against the wall. Callie however convinced him to let go of Mark after telling him she was dating and she was happy. She then asked him to remember she was happy and introduced him to her girlfriend Arizona.\n\nAfter a short while he came to the decision that Callie had to come home, after an argument with her he went to [[Richard Webber|the Chief]] and asked him to allow Callie to leave and offered him money. Richard told him that Callie was a grown woman, but Mr. Torres instead told him that it didn't matter how old she was, she was still his child. After another fight with Callie, he threatened to cut her off if she refused to go home. Callie stayed anyway and he took away all her money and got all his family to stop speaking to her. ''(\"[[Sweet Surrender]]\")''\n\nAfter he left, Callie's entire family stopped speaking to her because of his influence. ''(\"[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]]\")''\n\n\nCarlos returned to Seattle Grace again, this time with the family's priest, [[Father Kevin]], in tow. Callie was furious that her father had brought the priest in an attempt to \"pray away the gay.\" Following Arizona talking to both Callie, about being understanding of her father as he made a big adjustment, as it was Callie who changed the game after all this time, and to Carlos, about her upbringing and being the person her father raised her to be, Carlos and Callie forgave each other. He also asked if she'd still be getting married and having kids, which she said she would. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nCarlos and [[Lucia Torres|Lucia]] came to Seattle a few days before their daughter's marriage to [[Arizona Robbins]]. He talked about meeting a gay man on the flight there and easily accepted the relationship. However, his wife was cold and distant, which came to a head when she decided to leave and not attend the wedding. Callie told Carlos to leave as well, but he returned during the reception and danced with her, saying he'd dreamed about it since she was a little girl. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Callie was being sued by [[Travis Reed]], Carlos came to visit her, to give her support. When he learned that Arizona had cheated on Callie and they had separated, he revealed to her that he'd cheated on her mother before she was born and that her mother had forgiven him. This prompted her to reconcile with Arizona. ''(\"[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Lucia Torres]]. They've been married for over  years.

Due to his autism, he wouldn't let the doctors examine him, so Alex used his love of buildings and LEGO to talk to him. Gus was able to use LEGO to show Alex that he had significant pain in his chest. They ran a chest CT, which showed a thymoma, which Maggie noted is always malignant in children, but curable with surgery. However, before they could operate, he needed a blood transfusion as he was anemic. They got him blood, but he rejected it because it wasn't the right type. They re-typed his blood and showed AB, but with no Rh antigen, an extremely rare occurrence. Before he could have surgery, they needed to find blood donors who were an exact match to his blood so he wouldn't reject it. They identified only four potential donors in the world, but Alex promised his parents they'd keep looking until they found the blood he needed. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\nDuring his stay at the hospital, Gus continued to build with LEGO kits, including one of the Arc de Triomphe. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nThe wait was thought to be over when a call came in from Canada from a doctor treating a patient who was also Rh<sub>null</sub>. However, this was a misunderstanding and the doctor was hoping to find a donor for her patient, not offering her patient as a donor. When Gus's mother found out about the error, she was upset. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nOver time, Gus got so weak, he couldn't build his LEGO kits anymore. A blood donor was found in London, but she had severe agoraphobia, making the trip to the United States extremely difficult for her, even with her therapist. When her therapist was detained at the airport, she struggled even more and refused to leave the plane. However, after a call with Lori and meeting Gus, who was unconscious after having a heart attack, she agreed to be carried off the plane. She got into the car, but then a fog settled in, so they were stuck in traffic. Gus's organs continued to fail because of oxygen debt, so Alex took him to the hyperbaric chamber, in the hopes it would give him enough time to wait for the blood transfusion. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nIn the hyperbaric chamber, Gus was able to get more oxygen to his organs. However, he still coded, so they started decompressing the chamber as Frances was still on her way to the hospital with Owen. Alex did chest compressions and refused to stop until the blood had been transfused, at which point, he went back into sinus rhythm and regained consciousness. He immediately started to get stronger and his mother and Frances both watched as he was able to play a video game in his bed.

Mesa]]\n}}\n\n'''James Chee''' is a surgical resident at Grey Sloan Memorial who started near the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nDue to the growing Covid- pandemic, James and his fellow medical school graduates were sent to their residency programs earlier than the standard start date. They arrived on the first day and were welcomed reluctantly by [[Tom Koracick]]. James was assigned to do progress notes on the patients. He then left them tape and a marker to make name tags for themselves before leaving them.\n\nAfter two hours of working on progress notes for patients, James hadn't even finished one, angering [[Karen (Season )|Karen]], who was waiting for them. Tom stepped in and noted that his problem was that he kept putting, \"Home and awaiting follow-up\" for patients who had died. All the patients had died, which created an error. Tom fixed the problem and told James to carry on. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nOne day, James brought a patient into the hyperbaric chamber for wound therapy. Due to a busy schedule, his patient was scheduled for the same slot as Meredith. While they waited in the chamber, James asked Levi if Meredith was mean, as that's what he'd heard, but she got sick before he could work with her. Levi emphatically stated that she could be tough, but she was not mean. When James' patient started to wake up and eviscerated himself, Levi helped keep James calm and then pack his intestines back in. Then he had James call for the chamber to be depressurized so the patient could be moved back to the OR. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\nJames observed a laminectomy for a meningioma that Amelia was performing. Link was also in the gallery. When Amelia did her superhero pose before starting the surgery, James asked what she was doing and Link said she was preparing to crush it. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nDuring his days off, James volunteered at the urban Indian Health Clinic. Through his work there, he met [[William Lawrence]]. He treated William for COVID, but William later returned to the clinic having what appeared to be a stroke. James accompanied him to the hospital where the stroke was confirmed and he had a thrombectomy. After his thrombectomy, James went to his room and used some traditional medicine for William. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, she cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, James was able to get his first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them  seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total,  patients were treated using this method. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\n\nHe is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].

He was coming back from his morning walk and fell. His doorman, [[Vincent (Season )|Vincent]], had tried to catch him, but just couldn't quite get him. He was complaining about pain in his back. They examined him and found a contusion on his back. His wife, [[Angelica Paulson|Angelica]] arrived at the hospital after getting the message Vincent left for her. She was told he was stable for the time being.\n\nAn x-ray showed that his spine was broken at T, so Callie planned a spinal fusion with a bone graft to treat him.\n\nWhile he was waiting for his surgery, Vincent came to visit him while Angelica was out getting a cup of coffee. He asked if it was all right if he stayed and Leo said it was. They held hands until Meredith came in to talk to him.\n\nIn Leo's surgery, they discovered adenosarcoma, which had spread to his bones and livers and was why his spine snapped. He was told he had only six months to a year to live. When his wife came in, he said he needed to talk to her. Vincent came in behind her and Leo told Vincent that he thanked him for what he'd done, but he could leave, essentially ending things with him.\n\n\n\n[[Angelica Paulson]]\nHe and Angelica have been married for  years. Despite his attachment to their doorman, Vincent, he says he loves his wife and was never unfaithful to her.\n\n[[Vincent (Season )|Vincent]]\nHe says the first time he saw Vincent, his heart leaped out of his chest. When he found out Vincent felt the same way about him, he smiled for weeks. For the next fifteen years, they talked as Vincent's desk, but never crossed a physical line.

They all agreed that Matthew was a dreamboat, but when Jackson came in, they started fawning over for him, questioning if he was, \"''the'' Jackson.\" April dodged their questions and asked Matthew to take her sisters back to her apartment while she answered a page from the hospital. Her sisters instead insisted that they wanted to go with her.\n\n\nThe three of them went to the hospital with April, where she gave them a quick tour. On the tour, they met [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], whom Kimmie said was very brave because of her amputation. Jackson and Matthew then came in with a patient, on whom Matthew had performed an incorrect tracheotomy. April sent him away with her sisters.\n\n\nAfter being sent away from the trauma, Kimmie, Libby, and Alice planned the rest of April's bridal shower. The next day, they brought the supplies to the hospital and were upset to learn that April was in surgery and might not make it to the shower. When she finally did show up at the party, April started opening gifts. One of the gifts was a thong, which April mistakenly opened in front of everyone. When they picked on her for her lack of experience, she confessed that she'd had sex before, which shocked them. She then fired them as her bridesmaids and hired Arizona, Meredith, and Cristina to replace them. ''(\"[[Man on the Moon]]\")''\n\n\nLibby and her sisters were angry that April fired them as her bridesmaids and chose\ua[[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]],\ua[[Meredith Grey|Meredith]],\uaand\ua[[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]\uato be her bridesmaids instead. Despite their anger, they did attend the wedding, where they angrily looked at their sister's bridesmaids. When Jackson stood up to confess his love for April and ask her if she loved him too, Libby and her sisters were surprised by his confession and waited for April's answer.\ua''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n\n\nLibby is married.

She was briefly engaged to [[Lucas Ripley]] until his death. She is in a relationship with [[Theo Ruiz]].\n\n\n\nGrowing up, Victoria mainly lived with her grandmother Marion due to her parents being busy at their restaurant. While her father valued good grades, her grandmother was less strict and valued fun in life over professional success. She shared her love of musicals and singing talent with Vic. Over time, Vic learned to care for her grandmother as she began suffering from dementia. Vic landed the lead role in a performance of ''Pirates of Penzance'' and invited her parents to the premiere. They disappointed her by not showing up. Her grandmother, at that point heavily demented, used one of the tickets Vic had saved for her parents to get into the theater and loudly started singing along to \"Poor Wandering One,\" one of the songs she and Vic used to sing together when she was younger. Marion even walked onto stage, further disrupting the performance.<ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBy , her grandmother passed away and her parents returned to work almost immediately, leaving Vic to process her grief alone. At the time, she had landed the lead role in a musical and her emotions got the better of her during rehearsals. The director, [[Cooper]], told her not to apologize for it as her emotional life had been part of the reason why he had chosen her for the role. During rehearsals, [[Pruitt Herrera|Captain Pruitt Herrera]] and a colleague arrived to make sure everything was up to fire safety regulations. Having passed the process with flying colors multiple times before with other productions, Cooper convinced him to let it slide this once to spare them all the time. Soon after, during a final rehearsal, a fire broke out backstage. The entire production's cast and crew managed to make it to the exit, except for Cooper, who tried to save an expensive piano. Vic, who had stayed in the room to make sure everyone made it out safely, witnessed his pants getting caught on fire. She ran back to the stage as Station  arrived. Pruitt pulled her away from the stage and took her outside while Cooper was being burned alive. The whole experience made her decide to get into the Fire Academy and she ended up working with Pruitt at Station .<ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref> By , she joined the station as the new probie. On her first day, she met Travis in the locker room as he was crying over his husband's death. Her humor and cheerful demeanor made him laugh for the first time since Michael's death, marking the start of their close friendship.<ref>[[No One is Alone]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy was confused about her feelings, she called Maya and Vic to drink and hang out. They talked on the porch and admitted Ryan's looks when he came over to talk to Andy.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nVic tested out the fire simulator while no one else was around. When a fire burst toward her, she flinched and pulled the goggles off her face, making Ben suspect something was wrong.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen noticed Vic seemed to have a fear of fire after the tanker fire. He tried to help her, but she denied there was a problem. However, she later confessed to the rest of the team that she was afraid and they offered to help her without telling Jack or Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTo help her, Travis took her to meditation class, where she just fell asleep due to being woken up so early.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Maya noticed Vic just starting at the flames and stood with her when she said it helped.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nVic was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station . In the interview, she criticized Ripley, saying that one of his departments, Station , was so slow that it forced Station  to stop and help. She then said he either had to pick Jack or Andy. Vic apologized for that, but Ripley said she could go, that she'd told him everything he needed to know about how Jack and Andy captained her.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. Outside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount. The trapped were freed when they used the water heater to cause an explosion and compromise the door just enough to give them access.\n\nWhen Jack later asked Dean what happened with the access pad, Vic covered for him and he assured her there wouldn't be a next time.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the law firm, Maya and Vic worked with [[Molly]], the fire coordinator for the floor who took her job very seriously. They had her watch the stairwell while they checked the floor. When the evacuation was started, they had to keep the civilians calm as they waited for their turns. They sent the first group down with Molly, but when the fire jumped floors through the windows, the civilians panicked and started running down the stairs, which led to them trampling Molly. Maya and Vic worked on fighting the fire and Vic found that she wasn't afraid anymore.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nVic and Maya were evacuating the skyscraper together when they met up with Andy. Andy insisted on staying to rescue Jack, so Maya decided to stay with her to help and sent Vic down to find more people to help. On her way down, she found Travis, who had been left by Ben. She started tending to him and then dragging him down when she found that he was still alive. When Dean came back into the skyscraper and found them, he helped her get Travis out and into an ambulance to the hospital. When they arrived at the hospital, she was upset to see Ben because he'd left Travis. They waited for news on Travis and Molly and after learning that Molly had died, Vic asked Ben if he believed that Travis would live. He said that he hoped so. Travis ultimately survived his surgery and spent several weeks recovering afterward.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety. Throughout the ordeal, Vic was annoyed that [[Andrew DeLuca]] had been brought along to help, though at the end of the day, he gave her the number of [[David Mayhorn]], another firefighter who had a crush on her.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSullivan had suggested a peer group for firefighters to Travis and Vic to work out their conflict. They weren't going to go, but ultimately chose to. They were surprised to hear [[Lucas Ripley|Fire Chief Ripley]] talk about the skyscraper fire and the trauma he still experienced in the aftermath. After the group was over, Vic found him and apologized for yelling at him at the fire. He suggested that at the next group, she should speak about her own experiences.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Vic was paired with Andy in a group that contained Ryan. Vic tried to force them to talk by suggesting that Ryan go first.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated. At the party, Vic and Ripley flirted over the cake.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. After breaking up the whole tree, they finished the drive to the house, where a fire had started during a rescue. The fire was then extinguished. Ripley then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor. Vic didn't attend this party because she was spending time with Ripley instead.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Ripley had told his sister about their relationship, Vic decided to tell Travis. He was shocked to learn she'd been hooking up with the Chief.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Kathleen Noonan|Kat]] came into the station to check it out, she met Andy and Vic. She was looking around at all the stations to see where she might fit in, but she didn't believe she'd be able to get a spot at . Andy decided to give her a proper tour. Andy and Vic then talked to Kat about her experience at the Academy and not feeling like she was improving. They suggested rice. They got two bowls of rice and had Kat grip and release it to improve her grip strength. They said Kat needed to find a way to distinguish herself. She revealed that the skyscraper fire had inspired her to apply to the academy, as she'd been working in the building. At the end of the day, Andy introduced Kat to Sullivan.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. After getting hit by the patient's hand, Vic stepped away to help Andy treat the daughter, giving her glucose and orange juice when she passed out from low blood sugar. She then stepped in to help stabilize the building.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nRipley died from the consequences of hydrofluoric acid poisoning with Vic by his side. After his death, she let his sister and Robert handle the funeral arrangements as she had decided she wasn't going. Her crew tried to convince her to go, but she insisted on not attending. In Travis's final attempt, she revealed she didn't want to go because she was no one to Ripley on paper. However, she changed her mind when Levi showed up at the station with a bouquet and told her that Lucas wanted to give her flowers that said that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. She went to the funeral and was invited by Jennifer to sit with her. Afterwards, she went to her and Lucas's diner and told Cameron that they were not married and that he had died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria tends to meddle where she doesn't belong while revealing little to nothing about her own personal life. As the youngest member of the team, she is eager to prove herself as a crucial part of the team. She's fun-loving, sarcastic, and loyal.\n\n\n\n[[David Mayhorn]]\nAfter rescuing Max Forrester, Andrew DeLuca gave Vic the number of a firefighter from Station , David Mayhorn.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref> The two went out and had sex at Vic's apartment. The next morning, they woke up and said that neither of them usually did that, then proceeded to have sex again.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref> Vic referred to him as a very tall man blanket and nicknamed him Man Blanket .<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> According to Maya, Vic saw him three times a month before the windstorm, but the two ended things before Vic started seeing Ripley.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Lucas Ripley]]\nDuring the Captain peer reviews, Vic yelled at [[Lucas Ripley|Chief Ripley]] for not doing his job and making sure all stations were as good as Station , stating that it took Station  eight minutes to get to the call which affected the team of .<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref> After the skyscraper, Vic and Ripley had another confrontation in which she blamed him for evacuating the entire building with her whole team still inside and he told her if she came at him like that again, he'd fire her.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen she saw him at the firefighter peer support group, she was surprised to hear that he struggled with the aftermath of the skyscraper fire. After the meeting, she apologized for any role she might have played in his feelings.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> They then flirted at the police training session, which came to a head at Dean's birthday party, where they flirted over cake before eventually sleeping together after shift.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> The next morning, she woke up while he was in the shower and decided to sneak out before he finished. She worried about what that said all day and asked [[Jack Gibson|Gibson]] for advice, but when he called at the end of the day, she answered and they presumably agreed to continue seeing each other.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref> Ripley visited Station  during the windstorm as it was central to the storm, but worried that it would seem like he was there to see her, not that he didn't want to see her, but they were at work. Vic said it wouldn't and that they could be professional at work. After working together on a call breaking up a tree, Vic and Ripley agreed that what they'd done was hot and hooked up at the station.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ripley promoted Maya to lieutenant at station , Maya asked Vic for details (because Vic was seeing Mayhorn from ) in front of Ripley. Vic quickly shut down the line of questioning. Ripley later tried asked Vic about Mayhorn, but they were interrupted by Pruitt. During Jack's intervention, he almost exposed Vic and Ripley's secret relationship, but was interrupted by Ripley with news about Herrera and Sullivan.\n\nFour months after the windstorm, they were still seeing each other. They went to Astro Corner Coffee Shop so they could eat together in public. They then started to have sex in the parking lot, but the manager caught them and asked them not to.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Ripley had told his sister about them, Vic started to consider telling someone herself. She decided to tell Travis and told Ripley that she'd told her best friend. Not realizing that meant Travis, Ripley said he knew that she had the sense to tell someone away from the station.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile working together after the RV crashed into the station, Ripley figured out that Travis was the best friend that Vic had told about their relationship. He confronted Vic about it and Vic revealed that Gibson also knew about them. The two argued in Vic's bunk. Vic asked if their conversation should be over, but Lucas decided to walk away before he said something he didn't mean.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Vic saved a stranded couple and delivered their baby, Lucas was checking up on her in the Aid Car, but Vic told him she didn't need him and that she was awesome to which he responded that he knew. Later, Lucas was taking care of Vic at her apartment and Vic confronted him that they hadn't finished their fight and told him he was wrong because if an argument was all it took to break them up, they shouldn't even be together, so if they couldn't fight and make up, he could take his nice-smelling shirt and go. Lucas responded that he didn't want his shirt back and that no matter what, he didn't want to go, \"I don't want to let you go.\" He then got into bed with Vic despite the fact that she was sick.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSometime after this, Lucas christened Vic with her nickname, \"Eggy\" because of the dish she ordered for breakfast at the Astro Corner Coffee Shop. The manager of the diner apologized about scolding them when they were about to have sex in the parking lot and said they were relationship goals. He also assumed that Vic and Lucas were married, calling Lucas Vic's hubby. Lucas then told Vic about his previous wives and that if he would get married a third time, he would take it very seriously and he wouldn't be game unless he knew it was really right.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> Around this time, Vic met Jennifer, Lucas' sister, and the two hit it off even when Vic told her about how the two of them jumping out of planes during the weekends.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDuring the blackout, Lucas dropped by the station and, upon seeing Pruitt happy from his vacation, suggested he and Vic also take a vacation, but Vic reminded him of why that wouldn't work and all the other strings involved. When the lights went off at the station, Vic and Lucas made out in the hallway. After the call, Vic came home to Lucas and he told her he had vacation days and didn't want to be the guy who didn't use them. They agreed to go and Vic said it didn't matter where because life is too short before realizing it wouldn't work out because it could ruin their careers. Lucas then suggested that maybe they shouldn't be a secret anymore and they shared a kiss.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe next morning, they were in their diner discussing their options, and when Lucas told Vic about the disciplinary action involved if they went public, Vic was ready to back out. Lucas then suggested marriage as a way to cheat the system since rank didn't affect spouses working in the same department, but both of them decided it was too crazy before agreeing to explore other options. After Lucas went into a coffee processing plant to rescue the captain of station , Vic told him that they were reckless and that getting married to cheat the system wasn't them before proposing to him for real. Before he could say anything, she panicked and told him he didn't have to answer right then, so they agreed to meet at their diner in the morning for breakfast. The next morning, Vic went to the diner and waited for Lucas for two hours but he didn't show, so Vic stormed out, thinking he'd stood her up, and went to help with overhaul.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> \n\nUnbeknownst to her, Lucas was hospitalized due to a pre-existing condition and the effects from inhaling chemicals at the fire. While Lucas tried to reach her [[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|px|Vic and Lucas share one last kiss and say goodbye]]himself, her team found her and told her what was happening while Vic was rescuing a victim. Vic managed to complete the rescue before rushing off to the hospital, regretting the fact that her last words to Lucas were \"okie dokie\". At the hospital, Vic got into a fight with Jennifer because Jennifer blamed Vic for Lucas' condition. When she found out Vic had proposed, Jennifer allowed Vic to see Lucas and when it was clear Lucas was dying, Jennifer told Vic to go say goodbye to him. The couple reunited, albeit briefly. Vic said they could finally take that vacation and described their dream vacation. Lucas then accepted Vic's proposal and asked if they could get someone in the room to get married, but Vic just wanted to have the moment with him, just them. A crying Vic told him she was really ready to spend the rest of her life with him and Lucas said that at least he got to spend the rest of his with her. They shared a kiss and Vic held his hand until he died. Later, Vic was lying on top of the firetruck crying over her dead fianc\ue as she remembered when they said \"I love you\" for the first time while her team surrounded her.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Lucas died, Vic crashed with Andy and Maya, but left their apartment to go to the diner. When asked where her \"hubby\" was by the manager, Vic lied and said he was at work. Later, she went to work where she tried to act like nothing had happened despite the fact that it was the day before Lucas' funeral and everyone was concerned. She also announced that she wasn't going to the funeral, much to her team's disappointment. Travis, Sullivan, and Jennifer all tried to convince her to attend the funeral, but Vic refused, saying that she was nothing to Lucas. While arguing with Travis, she referred to Lucas as someone who could have been the love of her life, but wasn't her husband. Later, [[Levi Schmitt]] brought Vic a bouquet of flowers that was similar to the one Lucas had bought for her, telling her that Lucas said the bouquet meant he wanted to spend his entire life with her. This finally conviced Vic to attend the funeral and she joined Jennifer who asked her to sit in the area reserved for family members. Vic was devastated and she cried at the funeral before telling Andy and Maya she wanted to be alone afterwards. She took the bouquet of flowers and went to the diner where she told Cam the manager of the diner that Lucas wasn't her husband and she'd lied about him being at work before admitting that Lucas had died.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nVic met Jackson when she responded to a call and found him holding [[Jai Prishna]], who was dangling from a rope over a cliff. She helped him wench Jai up to safety. Later, when she was at the hospital to drop off another patient, he asked her to go get burgers, but she said maybe another time. Later, they had lunch together in the park and talked about Jai. She told him about Lucas dying and he told her about his recent breakup with Maggie. They both agreed that it wasn't a great time for either of them to start a new relationship. Despite this, they continued to see each other, though it remained mostly platonic.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n[[Theo Ruiz]]\nShe and Theo flirted over their morning jog.<ref>[[Don't Look Back in Anger]], x (S)</ref> He later asked her out on a date after seeing her outside her parents' restaurant, which he said had the best pierogi in town. She turned him down, saying she wasn't really dating because of the pandemic.<ref>[[Out of Control]], x (S)</ref> However, at a later meeting, Vic said she may have been a little rash turning him down and they made arrangements to go for a date after their next Covid test.<ref>[[Learning to Fly]], x</ref> The date went well, but while they were together, Theo got a call asking him to sub at station  the next day. Vic asked him not to tell anyone they were seeing each other and he agreed to that. When they were at the station, Vic learned that Theo was previously a captain and was the reason Travis's husband, Michael, was dead. Vic told him they couldn't see each other anymore because of that, but later comforted him when he said that day didn't just haunt Travis.<ref>[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Maya and Carina's wedding, Anthony Hughes invited Theo to join the celebration. He did and after the wedding, he ended up kissing Vic outside her parents' restaurant.<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Anthony Hughes]] and [[Lenya Hughes]]\nHer parents own [[Kaminski's]], a restaurant that serves Polish food. It's not successful enough for them to hire help so they run it themselves and are there all the time. As such, they don't have free time to visit their daughter, which means she has to go to the restaurant if she wants to see them.<ref>[[Eulogy]], x (S)</ref> Their restaurant got destroyed during a protest, which brought Vic and her parents together.<ref>[[Say Her Name]], x (S)</ref> It was remodeled in time for [[Maya and Carina's Wedding]].<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Marion Hughes]]\nVic had a strong relationship with her grandmother. She would watch movies with her and share her grades with her. Her grandmother developed dementia though and would forget things. Vic was often the one taking care of her grandmother and making sure she took her pills. Vic's grandmother's favorite show was \"Pirates Of Penzance\" <ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Travis Montgomery]]\nTwo weeks after his husband died, Travis was working at Station , where he met Vic. They had a rocky start because she disliked him second-guessing her, but Vic helped him through his grief and they bonded as Travis pushed Vic to train harder and do better.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> \n\nWhen Vic struggled with her fear of fire, she told her team while Andy and Jack were at the Incinerator and the team promised to help her overcome it while keeping it a secret from the two lieutenants as they were required to report it. Travis took Vic to meditation class where they ran into Grant and later helped Maya run some drills with Vic.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nVic was the one who found Travis in the stairwell at the skyscraper fire and dragged him down the stairs before running into Miller who helped her carry Travis outside. She rode with Travis in the Aid Car and waited for news on his condition with Warren and Grant.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon his return to work, Travis noticed some tension between himself and Vic. He asked her about it, but she denied anything was wrong. This later built up to a fight when she revealed that she was upset that he'd quit on life in the skyscraper. Sullivan told them to stop fighting at the station and suggested a peer support group where they could go.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref> After the peer support group, their friendship seemed to be on the mend as they were seen discusing Travis and Grant's relationship and Vic told her friend he needed to spice things up.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> When Travis was struggling with the fact that Grant didn't want to get married, he asked Vic for her advice and she told him that marriage wasn't everyone's endgame.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter she found out that Ripley told his sister about their relationship, Vic told Travis who was shocked and the two discussed Ripley being Vic's new hobby. Vic also comforted Travis when he revealed he was still hung up on Michael.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> Travis knowing later led to Vic and Ripley's first fight when he accidentally revealed to the latter that he knew about their secret relationship.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref> When Vic was upset after her and Ripley's fight, Travis comforted her but sent her home when she was sick.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Ripley ran into the burning coffee plant to rescue another captain, Travis made sure to support Vic and when Vic returned to overhaul, Travis asked her what had happened with Ripley since he knew about the proposal.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> Travis was worried to tell Vic about Ripley's condition while she was on the tower, but at Herrera's insistence, he radioed Vic and told her what had happened. He later told Vic that if she needed him to hunt down Dr. Pierce for her he would. When Vic had to go and say goodbye to Lucas, Travis held her hand as they walked through the hallway and he also hugged her when the entire team laid down with Vic on the firetruck while she cried over the loss of Ripley.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Ripley died, Travis was very concerned for Vic and he was surprised when she was back at work. He offered to take Vic to his place or to Andy and Maya's as Vic wasn't back at her apartment, but Vic refused and lashed out. When Vic said she wasn't coming to the funeral, Travis constantly tried to convince her to come which led to a fight between the two in which Vic pointed out the differences between her and Travis' experiences with loss, adding that she wasn't Travis and Lucas wasn't Travis' husband.

He's very dreamy, but he's not the sun, you are.|'''Cristina Yang''' to '''[[Meredith Grey]]'''}}\n\n'''Cristina Yang''' is a researcher, Chief Medical Officer, and Director of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]], having been trained at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], and [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She was engaged to [[Preston Burke]] and had a tumultuous relationship and marriage with [[Owen Hunt]]. She is also [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] [[Person(s)|person]].\n\n\n\nCristina is of Korean descent raised in Judaism (her mother converted upon re-marriage) and a native of Beverly Hills, California. Though Jewish, she has stated that she is not religious.\n\nAt her high school prom, her mom made her go with her best friend's son, whom Cristina said was a dork. She was okay with providing the kid a date, but once they got to the party, he tried to get sexual with her and touch her in front of the entire school by the punch bowl. He then threw up all over her dress because he was nervous to touch her.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nHer mother married Cristina's stepfather, [[Saul Rubenstein|Dr. Saul Rubenstein]], an oral surgeon, when Cristina was three. Cristina's biological father died when she was nine years old in a car accident; Cristina watched her father bleed out before help arrived, attempting to close his chest with her hands, to try to stop the bleeding. Cristina felt his last heartbeat in her hands. She claims this is the reason she became a doctor, and could very likely be the motive behind her interest in [[Cardiothoracic Surgery]].\n\n\nCristina is a graduate of [[Smith College]]. She earned her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she earned her M.D. from [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], where she graduated first of her class.\n\n\nCristina ended up pregnant after a sexual encounter with [[Preston Burke]]. She scheduled an abortion soon after she found out she was pregnant. She put off telling Burke about the pregnancy, and made the decision not to tell him after he broke things off with her. During a thoracotomy with Dr. Burke she began sweating and having severe pain and eventually collapsed in the [[Operating Room|OR]], seriously scaring Burke. [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] and [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] helped her and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] finally operated on her. One of her fallopian tubes had burst and she was bleeding out. Earlier, Cristina didn't seem so attached to the pregnancy and tried to convince everyone that she was fine but at the end of the day she finally broke down and she cried hysterically. When Burke came to visit her, he got into the bed beside her and held her.\n\n\nDuring the [[Hospital Shooting|hospital shooting]], Cristina and Meredith initially didn't take the lockdown alert seriously. They assumed lockdown meant not leaving the building and so lackadaisically wandered around. Derek found them and ordered them into a supply closet to hide. Cristina was peeking out of the window and saw the shooter, recognizing the man who asked for directions to Chief [[Derek Shepherd|Derek Shepherd's]] office. Cristina immediately realized that Derek's life was in danger, but once she divulged that Derek was one of the intended targets Meredith couldn't stand staying in place. Cristina tried to bodily stop her, but Meredith shoved her aside and ran out into the hallway.\nThey witnessed Derek and the shooter's stand-off. Cristina held back Meredith from intervening and possibly getting shot herself. After Derek was shot in the chest and the shooter walked away the two sprang into action. With the help of April Kepner, they got him down to the ER. There they found Jackson Avery who had a few scrub nurses and an anesthesiologist. Cristina begged [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] not to watch saying that it would distract her; implying that Meredith's pain would be the thing that would push her over the edge. Cristina said that gunshot wounds are always a little unpredictable. Cristina realized that the bullet was next to the aortic valve thus complicating the procedure all the more.\nUnfortunately the unthinkable happened and the shooter entered the OR with Cristina operating on Derek. He held Cristina and everyone at gunpoint demanding they stop and let Derek die. He warned that if Cristina continued operating, he would kill her. Owen tried to attack and apprehend the shooter but he himself was shot. Owen crumpled onto the ground and the gun was turned back onto doctors around the table. To defuse the situation Jackson pulled out the wires connecting Derek to the heart rate monitor making it look like Derek flatlined. Appeased, the shooter left the room and Cristina starting working again. She successfully saved Derek's life, but the incident traumatized her so completely that for months afterward Cristina practically refused to operate. Meredith and April operated on Owen Hunt's gunshot wound in a different OR. After Cristina finished with Derek, she went to visit Owen and agreed to marry him.\n\nAfter the shooting, Cristina and Meredith were the some of last to be cleared for surgery by the trauma counselor. Neither of them were truly dealing with their fallout; instead Cristina threw herself into planning her wedding. She hoped that she would be different, more steady afterwards but it did not help her PTSD. Owen convinced Richard to go over the trauma counselor's head and clear Cristina for surgery. Owen and Teddy thought that some cutting would jumpstart her recovery, bring the old Cristina back to the surface, but instead she had a PTSD episode in the OR. Jackson Avery accidentally dropped a tray of tools and the loud noise triggered Cristina. Meredith rushed in to comfort her; Meredith laid on the floor with Cristina until she was ready to get up. \n\nCristina went downhill from there. Derek first fought for her not to leave the program, insisting that because he owed her his life, he would help her through this. She worked with him in neuro for a while. When Derek's sister Amelia was visiting she even called Cristina a \"dud\" because of her reluctance to do even hold a retractor. Owen and Teddy made repeated efforts to engage, but Cristina was apathetic. The attendings tried to give her easy cases, understanding of her PSTD. Also during this time, Cristina and Meredith's friendship was tense. Cristina becomes frustrated that Meredith was seemingly recovered while she was still messed up. Cristina insisting that Meredith's wails to save her husband were part of the reason why she was still suffering.\n\nEventually, Cristina quit the program entirely. First, she and Torres organized a housewarming party. Derek warned her that Owen, Teddy, and Meredith were planning an intervention and the two of them spent the party on the roof drinking and talking about home renovation. Derek consistently was supportive of Cristina moving at her own pace. Meredith was convinced that Cristina wouldn't be fine until she returned to work. Derek, however, said that as long as Cristina was all right it didn't matter if she rejoined the program. Even when Cristina briefly become a bartender at Joe's and spent the night drinking and dancing like a party girl. Derek spent the night watching out for her until Owen came to take a very inebriated Cristina home. \n\nCristina went on a fishing trip with Derek to the surprise and shock of Meredith and Teddy. Owen however just wanted someone to spend time with Cristina during the day. Cristina did a lot of research the night before and quickly become frustrated with the lack of progress. Derek commented that she just needed to be quiet and patient, that fishing was about being relaxing. Cristina said that she couldn't just turn off her brain therein indicating she was becoming frustrated with the lack of intellectual stimulus in her new unemployed existence. Eventually, when she did catch a fish, a  pounder, Cristina got her picture taken with it but suddenly she started crying. It seemed that finally, Cristina was ready to begin healing.\n\n\nCristina found out she was pregnant, but did not want a child. When she told Owen she was going to have an abortion, he got very upset because even though he knew Cristina never wanted children, he wanted children. During their argument over the matter, she yelled again that she was saying no to a baby, leading him to kick her out of the firehouse. Cristina packed her stuff and moved in with Meredith. \n\nSince Derek left Meredith over her tampering with his trial, Cristina helped Meredith take care of Zola, of whom Meredith had been granted temporary custody. Cristina meanwhile tried to reach out to Owen, but he ignored her calls and walked away from her in the hospital every time she tried to tell him that she didn't get the abortion yet, as she didn't go through with it the first time. However, she was determined to have the abortion, with or without him, during her second appointment that night. While Teddy came around and told Cristina she would start teaching her again, Cristina found out that Meredith had been fired by the hospital board, leading Cristina to start hating Alex and urging Meredith to find a way to fight the board's decision. Cristina had a busy and boring day at work, as Teddy's new plan was to teach Cristina all about the basics, which Cristina skipped during her first years of residency because she was so talented. When Meredith informed Cristina that her new plan was to be a stay-at-home mother for Zola, Meredith questioned if Cristina if she wanted to be a mom too, which may have been the reason she didn't go through with the abortion the first time. Cristina assured her she did not want to be a mother; she wanted to be a surgeon and she really needed someone to get that, hoping Owen would be that person to support her decision, but she guessed he never would show up for the abortion.<ref>[[Free Falling]], x</ref>\n\nNoticing how the relationships between the fifth-year residents had deteriorated, Callie and Bailey organized a Gunther, some sort of test to see which one of the residents would step up as the leader while treating a patient. As suspected by most of the attendings, Cristina took the lead in the OR right until she accidentally administered epi to Alex, arresting his heart. Cristina immediately stopped operating and revived him with a crash cart. Although the epi revealed an underlying arrhythmia, Cristina admitted to Teddy that she moved too fast and made a mistake. Cristina was then paged to the hospital basement by Meredith, who had disappeared with Zola hours ago, because they were probably going to take her away. She promised a panicking Meredith she would fix it. \n\nShe did not get an abortion at the first appointment because Owen was threatening a divorce and she did not want to upset him so she waited to talk to him and then got another appointment to have an abortion. Owen came with her to the appointment and held her hand.\n\nOwen was upset with Cristina and so went out for a drink with a patient's friend. They both got drunk and on their way home she asked him to kiss her. He told her that he was married. She told him to kiss her anyway, which he did. One thing led to another and they had sex.\n\n\nDuring her final year of residency, Cristina was approached by many hospitals to join their programs. Many offered incentives, such as research labs and funding, as well as fruit baskets and Broadway tickets. While most other residents were flying around the country participating in interviews, Cristina was content to be wooed and let the heads of department come to her. Following the plane crash, she elected to leave [[Seattle]] to work at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota.\n\n\nTogether with Meredith, Derek, Lexie, Arizona, and Mark, Cristina boarded a plane that was supposed to take them to a hospital in Boise where they would assist on a surgery to separate conjoined twins. However, the back of the plane broke off during the flight, resulting in the plane crashing in the woods.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the crash, Cristina's shoulder was dislocated and she somehow lost one of her shoes. She helped a confused Meredith get back up and told her that the plane crashed. Meredith also couldn't find Derek lying around anywhere, and Cristina remembered that he was sucked out the side when the plane hit the trees and that the back of the plane came off. Meanwhile, Arizona kept on screaming in pain until Cristina yelled at her to shut up. When they heard a banging sound, she, Meredith, and Mark followed it and found Lexie trapped under the part of the plane that broke off. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Mark popping Cristina's shoulder back in.]]\n\nWhile Meredith went off looking for Derek, Cristina and Mark stayed with Lexie. Mark popped Cristina's shoulder back in and put her arm in an improvised sling, after which they tried to lift the part of the plane to release Lexie, though they were unsuccessful. Cristina asked Lexie about her condition, and she replied that her legs and pelvis were crushed and that she was not sure her left arm was still there. Both she and Cristina realized that Lexie wasn't going to make it, though Mark convinced a teary-eyed Cristina to go back the front part of the plane to get fluids and oxygen tanks.\n\nBack at the front part of the plane she stabilized Jerry's spine. Jerry, the pilot, told them that the rescue team should be there in four hours. While looking for supplies for the stabilization, Cristina found a flare gun, and when Jerry asked her about his potentially paralyzed legs, she got a pen and stuck it into his leg. He didn't react, and she apologized, indicating that they were indeed paralyzed. Cristina then got bottles of water, and Meredith came back saying she hadn't found Derek yet. She wanted to continue looking for him, though Cristina said she should come with her to Lexie first.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Cristina and Meredith find out Lexie has passed away.]]\n\nHowever, when they arrived at the back part of the plane, they found a devastated Mark next to Lexie, who had only succumbed to her injuries seconds ago. Cristina sat down and started staring in front of her while mourning the loss. She and Meredith eventually decided to go look for Derek, until he appeared with a bleeding hand. \n\nCristina went back to the front part of the plane to look for supplies to treat Derek's hand the best way possible. Cristina returned to the back part of the plane, where she handed the supplies she found over to Meredith, who closed the tear in Derek's hand with a safety pin. Meanwhile, Cristina wanted to start a fire using matches she found, and urged Mark to help her, but she noticed he was really weak. As he didn't react, she tore open his shirt, revealing he had a massive cardiac tamponade. Cristina then instructed Meredith on how to do a pericardiocentesis, which Meredith pulled off successfully. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|The plane crash victims.]]\n\nAfter that, they dragged Mark back to the front part of the plane, to Arizona. They informed her on what happened and Cristina gave Meredith the  remaining matches to build a fire when suddenly a helicopter passed. They tried to fire the flare gun, but it didn't work. They slept through the night, waiting for help to arrive.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nCristina was the only one who was awake when the rescue helicopter finally came to rescue the plane crash victims. She stepped into the light and waved to get the pilot's attention. She was taken to the Boise Hospital with the others, where Cristina kept on fighting the doctors. They sedated her and tied her to her bed. When Owen arrived, the Chief of Boise told him she thought that Cristina was in a state of reactive psychosis.\n\nCristina was sedated again before being flown back to Seattle. She remained in her state of reactive psychosis, refusing to speak. While she just laid in bed, her sight was blurry and every sound was muted in her ears. The doctors at Seattle tried to help her, but she didn't react to anything they tried. She reacted for the first time when a couple of interns were talking about her outside her room. She grabbed a vase and threw it at the window, after which the interns ran off. When [[Dr. Hurst|another doctor]] interfered with Cristina's case and yelled at Owen and Bailey that she belongs in psych, Meredith once again urged Cristina to talk, but it didn't have any effect.\n\nHowever, at some point, Owen decided to take her home with him. In the tub, Owen assured her they could figure it out, but Cristina replied that she could never get out. She finally started talking about what happened during the four days they were in the woods. She stayed awake every minute of those days and tried to take care of the other doctors, clearing the bugs out of Arizona's leg and keeping Mark alive. While everyone was asleep, she took care of everyone under the very dark sky. Out of necessity, she had to drink her pee and even the fuel from the plane. She also tried to keep the wild animals off Lexie's body, but wasn't successful doing so.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nSoon after, Cristina got out of her state and made plans to relocate to Minnesota, where she took a job at the Mayo Clinic. Before taking off, Cristina had a discussion with Meredith, who was worried that Cristina was just running away. Cristina admitted she was just fleeing from Seattle, where horrible things kept happening to her. Meredith wanted to stick together, but Cristina only advised Meredith to leave too. An angry Meredith then yelled that Cristina's person was Cristina herself and that she should just leave. Cristina then got in her car and drove off to Minnesota. After their fight, she and Meredith didn't have contact for a couple of months until Meredith left her a voice mail to tell her that Seattle also meant positive things to her, for example, it's the place where she met Cristina. Cristina then called her back to tell her that Meredith was still her person, and that she always would be.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n[[File:Christinainmayoclinic.jpg|thumb|xpx|Cristina in Minnesota]]\n\nHowever, at the Mayo Clinic, Cristina had some difficulties fitting in. She was tasked to \"babysit\" [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]], a very old surgeon with boring stories. She constantly FaceTimed with Meredith when not operating, and made plans to fly to Seattle when Mark would be taken off life support. She had tried to fly to Seattle previously, but chickened out every time. She promised Meredith that this time, it would be different. Later that day, she revealed she wasn't really in a hurry to get to Seattle, as Mark would still be in a coma whenever she arrived at Seattle. She missed her flight when she operated with Dr. Thomas observing her, though she thought about Mark when it was  o'clock in Seattle. After the surgery, Cristina asked [[Darren Parker|Dr. Parker]] to steer Dr. Thomas into someone else's direction, even though she insisted she was a team player. However, Dr. Parker ordered her to take a couple of days off to soften her sharp Seattle edges. That night, she FaceTimed with Meredith again and they agreed they needed to get over their fear of flying, as neither of them was able to fly to the other one.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nBefore the plane crash was going to be investigated, the plane company offered the group of doctors a one-time settlement.  The doctors had to decide unanimously, but taking the settlement would mean there wouldn't be an investigation. During one of their regular, short phone conversations, Owen informed her about the settlement and she promised to call him in three days when she would make her decision. She returned to work the next day after her days off, where she faked a story about having visited the Mall of America. He figured out she just googled it, but she assured him she was ready to be a team player. He ordered her to work with Thomas, only believing team playing when he sees it. Later that day, she complained to Parker about Thomas's conservative approach. He promised her she'd join him in the OR very soon to learn cutting edge surgery, but she had to take her turn in babysitting the old guy. This urged her to try to do her best to fit in, even smiling on command. During a FaceTime with Meredith, Cristina told her she and Owen only talked about the settlement and that she would just agree with what the others would decide about the settlement since she was a team player now. In surgery with Thomas, he confessed having googled her but continued to teach her when she told she preferred to talk about medicine. She was impressed with his techniques, despite them being conservative. Cristina called Owen an hour before the settlement meeting, telling him she was fine with whatever the group decided. She also said they couldn't keep calling each other because she was beginning a new life in Minnesota.\n\nAt the end of the day, an emotional Cristina sat down on a bench outside the hospital, where Thomas joined her. He revealed he once had been in a plane crash too, and he never talked about it. They started talking about how everything, like cigarettes, seems to kill you these days, which started off their friendship.<ref>[[Love the One You're With]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, she started a sexual relationship with Dr. Parker, resulting in quickies in his office. Through her, Parker was informed on the old surgical procedures that Thomas doing. During a phone call with Meredith, Cristina revealed that having sex was her way of trying to fit in, making friends. She confessed she didn't even like Parker, but it's not necessary to like a sex friend. However, she became regular friends with the ancient guy, telling Meredith he was her bestie, the Minnesota version of Meredith. She reassured Meredith that Parker was fine and that it was just a way to get an orgasm. Cristina and Craig Thomas worked together, with her constantly making jokes about his age. While practicing for her surgery with Thomas, Parker asked her if she even suggested a less invasive approach. She did, a procedure that would only take half the time, but he asked her if they were a hospital or a pizza delivery service, and if they needed to have it done in  minutes or less. Parker and Cristina agreed he was stubborn, but Cristina pointed out there were also advantages to Thomas' procedure. \"Enjoy him while you can,\" Parker said as Cristina returned to Craig. She asked if this meant she was off probation soon, but he didn't answer. \n\nIn the evening, Cristina went to Darren Parker's house to ask him what his deal was with Dr. Thomas. He was disappointed because she came to him to talk about Thomas rather than having sex. He asked her to come, which she only did because it was cold outside. She asked if he was firing Thomas. Parker said they couldn't fire Thomas, only force him to retire. He said that telling her this broke a whole lot of board regulations, but she interrupted him and asked him to name one mistake Thomas had made. He hadn't, but when he did, his age would make it an instant malpractice suit that the hospital would lose. He added that Thomas was years behind in his medical education, which she said herself. He questioned if Craig refused to try the minimally invasive technique because he was stubborn or because he didn't know how to. Cristina realized that is why Parker had had her working with Thomas, because she represents everything that is new, smart, and advanced in their field, which is his exact opposite. When the time would come to make a case, it would be helpful if she were to help them do it. Cristina angrily said that he should've told her and left his house, with him saying he thought she'd never have a problem with it.\n\nThe next day at work, Cristina once again asked Thomas why they weren't doing the minimally invasive technique. He replied it was because they had a surgical plan, but she said she thought he rejected her pitches because they scared him. He thought she had learned something from him. She had, that mortality was breathing down his neck and that he was running from the future like a scared old chicken. He said he was perfectly able of threading a catheter, so she dared him to prove her wrong. While she was scrubbing in for the surgery, Parker came in and asked her what she said to him to make him change his plan, thinking he could legally get in trouble if she told Thomas about what the board was up to. Cristina said it was Thomas' idea and that she was surprised too when he suddenly changed his mind. Parker thought about it and said they might even luck out because he had never seen Thomas do a procedure like this and he wouldn't allow it if Cristina wouldn't be in there to take over when Thomas craps out. He said that Thomas crapping out would be all the board needs for his dismissal. Parker left and Thomas beckoned her from the OR.\n\nIn surgery, Thomas was having trouble with the catheter but Cristina gave him tips to pull it off successfully. When it worked, Thomas got enthusiastic about the modern procedure and refused her help when she offered to finish it. In the evening, Parker joined Cristina on her way out, knowing Thomas pulled off the procedure successfully, and she told him he could look a little less disappointed. She said Thomas was a historical treasure and that that was in no way funny. He offered her to go and have sex, but she rejected him because she was meeting a friend for drinks. He said it was nice that she was making friends and wanted to continue, but she wished him a good night and walked off. At a bar, she and Craig were having a drink. Craig knew they were trying to push him out, showing her the watch they gave him at a surprise retirement party four years ago. He thought the watch was a piece of junk, but he wore it just to screw with him. He said they were all so polite and didn't dare to say anything directly. It'd been a while since he had anyone who cared enough to give him grief. Cristina ordered another drink and urged Thomas to order something that contains actual alcohol, so he ordered an old fashioned. She laughed and decided to order one too, instead of another tequila.<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n\nAs Cristina woke up on a morning, she felt miserable. Parker slept over and tried to be nice, but she brushed him off. Leaving for work, she friendly greeted her neighbor, telling Meredith on the phone that she was neighborly now. As she came outside, she found her car buried under a mountain of snow. Luckily, Dr. Thomas soon came to pick her up and he gave her a danish, accompanied with the scans of a huge aneurysm they were going to operate on together. Parker offered her to join on his cool surgery in the afternoon, but she simply stated not being available. Parker soon interfered with Thomas' case and told Cristina that even though Craig was a great old guy, there was nothing to gain by working with him. Cristina thought otherwise and walked away. Parker came to check up multiple times during the surgery, wanting to interfere when the aneurysm blew, but Thomas told him to back off. After surgery, Parker put Thomas on probation as he refused to step down gracefully and he asked Cristina to talk to Thomas. Cristina confessed to Thomas that she felt guilty over what happened, but he assured her that Parker had been after him a long time. He told her not to worry about his employment and drove her home to get a good night's sleep before the second surgery on their patient. \n\nInspired by her doomsday prepper patient, Cristina assembled her own bug-out bag, filled with tequila. As Cristina was worried that Parker wouldn't sign off on the second surgery, Thomas told her that the sex with Parker made her conventional and skittish and that he tried not to think about Parker. Cristina couldn't let it go and went to talk to Parker, asking him to let it slide and not to fire Thomas. He said that Thomas was holding her back, which she'd see once he was gone. Cristina then tried to convince Thomas to let her do the surgery with someone else, as it could be the end of him, but Thomas said he may be ready for that. Cristina shouted she couldn't work at the hospital without him, but he pointed out she wasn't going anywhere due to her fear of flying. He revealed he wanted to go down fighting for something he believes in. \n\n\nIn surgery, Cristina joked that she was his dream come true, which he affirmed. He continued to teach her and complimented her, saying she would be the surgeon of her generation. He told her people would try to diminish her, but they would fail. Suddenly, while operating, Craig froze, looked up at her and fell down. Nurses still tried to resuscitate him as Cristina continued operating, but it was too late. She continued operating with his advice in her mind. She successfully finished the surgery. As she kept thinking about his advice and compliments, she saw his body being rolled off on a gurney and she ignored Parker, who tried to reach out. While remembering that Thomas told her that none of the people at this hospital had the capacity to understand her, she got dressed and left the hospital. She took a flight to Seattle and showed up at Meredith's house, where they hugged after all the time they hadn't met. Cristina had drunk all the tequila from her bug-out bag to board the plane. Seeing each other helped them to accept both Thomas' and Lexie's death.<ref>[[Beautiful Doom]], x</ref>\n\nCristina moved back into the dream house with Meredith, who understood she needed support after her friend's death. Cristina soon met up with Owen, who showed her what he could offer her salary-wise. She thanked him, but he told her she should thank Jeff Russell, the new head of cardio who really pushed to get her. He told her there was a meeting about the plane crash lawsuit. She had to be there now, because he wasn't acting as her proxy anymore. He gave her an orientation packet and formally welcomed her to the hospital. Cristina marked her return with some mean comments towards April and her way to treat the interns. She soon met up with Jeff, who simply told her to go and have fun, see patients. He trusted her to run his service while he was dealing with his own research and surgeries. He allowed her to sign her own surgeries and only asked her to call him if she had a really cool case. She reminded him she was only a fellow, but he believed that she was as good as an attending. In the plane crash meeting, Cristina was informed they were going to talk about physical, mental or emotional difficulties that they experienced after the crash. They were informed that these harms would mean a sizable award for them, much bigger than the offered settlement. After hearing they might go after Jerry, the pilot, for the money, Cristina said she couldn't help them and left. She started naming the interns with dwarf names, making them hate her.\n\nOne of the lawyers followed her and convinced her a statement of her could benefit all of them, so she told him her shoulder hurts sometimes and that she may have had some PTSD. This made her realize she did have some things to talk about and agreed to  minutes, but she was called by a nurse for a patient emergency. She allowed her interns to scrub in with her, making them realize she was awesome instead of hate worthy. The surgery went great, with Cristina teaching the interns that it was sometimes better to do things the old fashioned way. After surgery, Owen yelled at her for having operated on Russell's patient without consulting him first, believing Russell would fire her for that. There was a little meeting with Russell and the two of them, and while waiting for Russell, Cristina told Owen he shouldn't have hired her back if he didn't want her there. Russell arrived and simply stated Cristina made a good call. Seeing what Cristina did, Russell told Owen he now knew why Owen pushed him so hard to get Cristina on staff. Cristina was surprised to hear this and Owen quickly left, feeling awkward. At the last meeting of the day, Cristina begged her lawyers to leave the pilot, who is paralyzed now, alone. After Owen was asked to step out, their lawyers told them the best strategy would be to look for a fault from this hospital itself, the people who put them on the plane: Owen. After coming home from work, Cristina realized that the firehouse didn't feel like a home anymore and packed her stuff, moving in with Alex, who bought Meredith's old house. Even though he didn't want roommates at first, she managed to convince him.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a morning meeting, Owen assured all attendings that the fact that a group of doctors filing a lawsuit against the hospital wouldn't affect their work. After everyone left, Cristina asked what he wanted to do about the firehouse, as she wasn't staying there anymore. He simply told her to do what she liked, as it was her house. During a conversation with Meredith, Cristina said she didn't want to feel like Owen's old wife, chained in the attic, but she didn't know what she wanted to be to him. Cristina met Owen to have him sign off on her surgery and she asked him why she was here, as he pushed so hard to have her back but still didn't seem to want her here. He stated she was good business, but she asked if that was the only reason. He said she moved away, asked him to stop calling, and now she's back, so he had no idea what she wanted. Neither did she, but he pointed out they don't work because they'll always end up hurting each other because they want different things. That's what they've always known and nothing changed about it. During surgery with Bailey, Cristina advised Bailey to just put on her wedding dress and get married, just like she did with Owen. After surgery, Bailey noticed how Cristina cared about the interns, even having fought Bailey to teach one, and how she cared enough about Bailey's wedding to give her good personal advice. She pointed out Cristina changed, even though Cristina didn't think so. This made her think about Owen saying nothing changed between them. She thought maybe she was the thing that changed, and she asked Meredith if she did. Meredith said she did, because she wanted Owen back. Owen came to the firehouse to talk, and just as she wanted to say she wanted to try again, he told her wanted a divorce.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn the day of Bailey's wedding, Owen informed Cristina that the lawyer put together the divorce papers, which he'd send tomorrow. Cristina pointed out it was fast, but Owen told her he asked the lawyer to be fast and asked if that was a problem for her. She said no, but seemed to feel otherwise. They agreed to be amical so they could still work together. However, during a conversation with Meredith, Cristina found out that Owen only asked for a divorce because it would benefit the doctors in the lawsuit. After a surgery together, Cristina asked him if it was true. It was, because he really wanted them to get the money and he didn't ask her first because he thought she'd reject it just because it was his idea. She asked him why he made the unilateral decision about their marriage, but he simply asked her why she didn't dare to ask for a divorce when moving across the country. She yelled that he let the plane crash make the decision for him, only to have him revealing that he feels insanely guilty because he is the one who chose the airline due to budget cuts he had to make. She assured him he wasn't at fault, but he couldn't let go of his guilt. After getting dressed for Bailey's wedding, Cristina went to Owen and asked him if the lawsuit was the only reason he asked for a divorce. He didn't know what to say, so she confessed she was going to ask him to try again when he asked for the divorce, resulting in a passionate kiss.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nThe kiss resulted in them having sex again. After making out, Cristina said that maybe, they were going to be fine. He didn't want to talk about at that moment and started kissing her, but stopped when he got paged. After having worked together all day in the ER, they sat down in a lounge with the divorce papers. She proposed they take a minute to think about what this meant, but he was done thinking about it and confessed they never should've gotten married, as they only put themselves in a box where they kept beating each other again the walls and ripping each other apart over the last two years. He said that they would get out of that box once they signed the papers, after which she took a pen and signed the papers, after which he did the same. They held hands as they both cried and kissed each other to show that they still love each other, even though their marriage ended.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nThey went from being married to being friends with benefits, with Cristina commenting to Meredith that having sex with someone who used to be your husband is way better than when you're still married. After they got a call from their lawyers, they went to the courtroom to find out they won the case and were awarded with  million dollars each. When they returned to the hospital, Cristina revealed to Derek that she figured out Meredith was pregnant, even though Meredith hadn't told her yet. She and Owen went to an [[On-Call Room|on-call room]] where they talked about the plane crash lawsuit. She asked him to come to Callie's survivor dinner that night, but he refused as Derek was still blaming him. Cristina wanted to comment on this, but he told her he just wanted to enjoy the moment of them being together and they started to undress. After the sex, Cristina went to talk to Derek and begged him to forgive Owen so they could all move past the plane crash, but Derek said it wasn't that easy. In the evening at the restaurant, Callie made her colleagues realize that they should be celebrating because they were all still alive. To make the dinner more fun, Cristina kept on sexting Owen until the others caught her. During the toast, Meredith revealed that she was pregnant and Cristina acted as surprised as the others. Derek called Owen and forgave him and asked him to come over, but Owen refused. Cristina took over the phone and asked him to come and celebrate with them, but Owen still rejected the offer, even after she told him there were bathroom doors that lock. Without the survivors knowing, Owen was informed that the hospital would have to pay the survivors, as the insurance company found a loophole and thereby wouldn't pay. This would mean that the hospital would go bankrupt and would have to close its doors.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Alana Cahill, a physician's advisor, was hired by the hospital to find a way to save some money and prevent the hospital from going bankrupt, the doctors were informed that the ER would be closed down.<ref>[[Walking on a Dream]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, cameras were installed in the CCU. There was a remote physician behind the eye to help reduce mistakes, improve patient care and maximize physician hours. Cristina felt extremely uncomfortable with the cameras, thinking they'd soon be installed everywhere (on-call rooms included), and soon started to butt heads with the remote physician. That evening, the ER was closed and Cristina comforted Owen, who was sad as there was no more trauma department in the hospital. She joined him as he went to the bar to go have a drink.<ref>[[Bad Blood]], x</ref>\n\nEverytime Owen visited the house, they had loud and hot sex, being made fun of by Alex and Jo. After it became public that the hospital could only be saved through a buyer, Alana started looking for a face to represent the hospital, Cristina was asked to, but she refused as her face only goes on the Nobel brochure. Meanwhile, Alana found a company called Pegasus that was interested in buying. Cristina helped the other doctors take care of hit-and-run victim, despite the fact that the hospital no longer was a trauma center, jeopardizing the sale to Pegasus. At the end of the day, Owen told Cristina the staff was killing him, though they both realized it was the right thing to do. They started to make out in the on-call room again while Callie informed the other survivors that a Pegasus hospital is all but positive and suggested they buy the hospital themselves.<ref>[[The Face of Change]], x</ref>\n\nWhile the others were having a meeting about Callie's suggestion at Meredith's house, Cristina and Owen were having sex, ignoring Meredith's texts. Owen gets a text from Cahill and confides in Cristina that if there's even a small group of staff that quits, Pegasus backs out. She promised him that wouldn't happen and continued making out with him. The next day at work, Meredith informed her that they were thinking about buying the hospital. Cristina laughed it and didn't understand why Meredith thought she'd be on board. Cristina said they have no idea how to run a hospital and she also told Meredith that they couldn't quit, as this would make the whole hospital go down. Even the interns started talking about looking elsewhere, but Cristina urged them to stay loyal to the hospital. Stephanie made her realize though that the interns now don't have the same things as Cristina had when she was an intern. This made Cristina agree to listen to Stan, Derek's financial adviser. He told them they needed more money than they all had combined and that they needed the hospital's financial statements if they were to continue with the plan and if they wanted a precise number of how much more money they needed. Cristina said Owen could get them, but Stan told her that Owen was legally obligated to tell Pegasus everything that could jeopardize the sale, so she should keep him completely in the dark about their plans.\n\nCristina overheard Owen promising the nurses that Pegasus was their best option. She later asked him if he really believed this, and he replied he didn't. She asked him why he was fighting so hard then. Because it's the only option, he said. As Owen got a call from Alana to inform him that Pegasus moved up the sale and that they would buy the hospital that night, Cristina realized they needed to do something, fast. As all other survivors finally agreed to buy the hospital, Cristina informed them about Pegasus' plans and told them there was only one thing they could do. They went to the conference room where Pegasus was about to buy the hospital and they all quit their jobs, making Pegasus back out. Cristina felt like she stabbed Owen in the back, but Meredith assured her Owen would understand once they could tell him, which Cristina doubted. The group of doctors went to Meredith's house, where Stan explained that they needed to form an LLC so they could legally get all their funds in one place.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\nThey found out that they would need  million dollars on top of their own money, so they started looking for an investor. They assembled a packet to convince possible investers, but Cristina didn't believe a packet would convince someone to invest so much money. She was worried this wouldn't work, because Owen stopped calling and he would never speak to her again if this whole project failed. Meredith assured her Owen would be the happiest of all once they bought the hospital and the sneaking around could stop. Alex informed them the hospital was following apart after they quit, as a lot of staff members followed their example. Cristina wanted to ease Alex's fear, but Meredith reminded her they couldn't tell anyone. They found a possible investor in [[Julian Crest]], who would love their main idea of research being very important in the hospital. After a successful meeting with his junior executives, their case was passed up to his business development guys, who wanted to see more of the financial side rather than their medical dreams only. Stan gave them a folder with that kind of information, which made one of the suits run it by Mr. Crest, who agreed to give the doctors  minutes in the afternoon before leaving for Dubai. \n\nThrough Heather Brooks, they found out that Alana managed to make a new deal with Pegasus. The company wanted to buy the hospital to liquidate its assets and lay off its staff and the hospital board would agree, as there was no other deal. As Crest was their last chance to save the staff, they were encouraged to learn everything about the financial side by heart. Crest thought they were looking for an out-right buyer, not that they actually wanted to run the place. He did his homework on them and found out that there was no manager in the bunch, no administrative leadership experience. He respected their passion and shared it, but he wasn't feeling it. He advised them to get someone with real administrative experience on their team and then they could talk again. While Meredith went to get Richard on their team, Cristina confessed everything to Owen as telling him wouldn't make any more difference now. She explained they only walked out to stall the sale to Pegasus and that they have an investor, only needing him and Webber to get the guy on board before the Pegasus deal would close. She said she didn't tell him because he could be sued or end up in jail due to the disclosure agreements he signed. She promised she was only trying to protect him, after which he went to the board to tell them about the doctors' plan so they wouldn't agree to the Pegasus deal.\n\nThe group, plus Richard, returned to Julian Crest and introduced him to the leadership he asked for. Derek and Richard flew to the airport together with Julian in his helicopter so they could talk about it again. The others drove there, only to find out from Richard and Derek that Julian said no again. After this, Cristina met Owen at Joe's. He enthusiastically told her the board decided to wait for them to present their offer, but she had to tell him Julian wasn't going to invest. This meant it was over for the hospital. They returned to Alex's house, where Alex started blaming them for what happened. Cristina finally told him they were trying to buy the hospital and that they screwed up. He got them some good booze and requested they finally started talking to him. The next morning, all doctors were called to a hotel where Catherine Avery, informed about the problems by Richard, told them that the Harper Avery Foundation would very much like to invest with them. There was only one condition: they would like a representative of their choosing to sit on the board of directors. They all happily agreed to the offer, but weren't so enthusiastic to find out Jackson was the elected representative.<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\nNeither of the doctors were happy that Jackson has a bigger say than one of them in running the hospital, but because he represents the Harper Avery Foundation, which put in the majority of the money, Jackson has the decisive vote and the right to veto theirs. Jackson was late during their first meeting and he revealed that the Foundation was still thinking about the reopening of the trauma department and that they were thinking to replace Owen as Chief of Surgery, because they were starting fresh and it'd be good for the moral. No one agreed to this and Cristina told him that this thing with Owen wouldn't happen, no matter who was giving him his marching orders. Meredith pointed out they were grateful for the Foundation's investment, but they didn't ask them to start dictating policy. Jackson replied no one asked them to sue the hospital into bankruptcy either. They reminded him they did so for the plane crash that killed Lexie and left the room.\n\nCristina went to tell Owen that Avery was talking about replacing him, but she assured him they wouldn't let that happen. She just didn't want him to hear a rumor. He was determined to fix this himself. Cristina found out that Owen quit. He told her he did so because someone was still blaming him for everything, which made him believe he couldn't be effective. The other board members weren't glad she told Owen, but she stated they've been going behind his back for long enough. During the day, Cristina contributed to creating an administrative mess to show Jackson he wasn't capable of leading a hospital. Cristina met up with Derek, whose comments about who to blame made Owen walk out, and told him he should stop blaming Owen. She didn't understand what it was about, as Derek seemingly forgave him months ago. Jackson stepped up as a leader when he managed to solve the OR crisis and find an available OR for Cristina. \n\nIn the evening, the doctors signed the documents and they officially became the board of directors. Before they could leave the room, Jackson wanted to share some things that were top priority. They agreed to listen and he told her he wanted to reinstate Owen Hunt as Chief of Surgery, to which Owen agreed. This brought him to his second point: they were reopening the ER so they would be a level  trauma center again. From now on, the Foundation would be following their lead, not the other way around. Lastly, he proposed they rename the hospital, as they were building a new hospital that stands for leading and innovation and he wanted them to remember they were a hospital run by doctors, which should mean something. He suggested a name to remember the very reason they came together and been able to do this. He turned around a paper and revealed the name \"Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital\", a name that exemplifies the spirit of the hospital but also the depth of their dedication. With every member of the board voting in favor, the hospital was officially renamed.<ref>[[Transplant Wasteland]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, a brand new ER was opened with cutting edge equipment. Owen was very pleased with this, thanking Cristina with a passionate kiss. The board also had a  hour meeting to decide on a logo for the hospital. Cristina was excited about the fact that them buying the hospital earned them an article in the magazine Surgery Today. While browsing through a magazine, she saw an article about Marcus Cho, a \"moron\" who was a year behind her at Stanford. Frustrated that other doctors were doing research while she kept on postponing research to fulfill her administrative duties, she went to look for Dr. Russell to find earth-shattering badass cardio research she could get in on. Russell overheard her saying this and was glad to hear her say that, thinking he had just the right procedure for her. He introduced her to his valve trial, allowing her to complete the procedure on her own on his patient of the day. She enthusiastically told him everything she knew about the procedure and confessed she had wanted to get in on the trial ever since she heard about it. After the procedure, she was completely impressed. He told her the results of phase  had been astounding and she asked when phase  would begin. That depended on her, he said. She thought he would allow her to do phase , but he told her it was his trial and that he didn't need another surgeon. What he needed from her was  million dollars to keep it going. She thought he was bringing her onto the trial, but understood he was only pitching her. He said it was nice to finally have someone on the board who got what he was doing.\n\nCristina ventilated her frustration to Meredith. She said that this was exactly what she was afraid of: the administrative duties were taking over her career, and now Russell saw her as someone on the board instead of as a surgeon. To give Miranda the money she needed for her genome project and to punish Russell for the way he treated her, Cristina cut Russell's budget by a few million. He shouted he asked for more and that this would mean he had to lose a resident and a research assistant. Probably two of each, she pointed out and fakely apologized. This only left him with her, determined to take over the work of those four people and do her very best at it. She would treat his patients, take his surgeries and assist in research, including projects she'd find on her own. \"Pile it on,\" she said and he started objecting he couldn't do that, but she told him the board believed he could. In the evening, she took a whole bunch of research material home with her to get through that night.<ref>[[Idle Hands]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter hot morning sex, Owen was paged to the hospital for the victims of a big accident on the highway. Cristina started treating Paul Dawson, the father of Ethan, the boy Owen took care of. Cristina had to operate on Paul and Owen soon came to check if she could give him a time frame for Ethan. As Ethan was fine but his mother had to have surgery as well, Owen spent time with Ethan to comfort him. In the evening, Owen and Cristina hung out together in an on-call room. She informed she had no idea when Paul could be transferred out of the CCU, which Owen hoped would be soon as Ethan started freaking out. He soon fell asleep and she got paged. She went to Paul's room, where Paul was arresting. She managed to revive him and induced therapeutic hypothermia, which would help to avoid another attack. Owen started caring for this family and questioned her move, asking her about Russell's approval. She reminded him he was her patient, but he went to talk to Russell about it. He agreed with Cristina's plan, though Owen suspected he may only do so because he was afraid of her, like she suspected herself. Cristina asked what was going on and he explained that Paul had a little boy of whom both parents were hospitalized. She assured him she only made the decision in the best interest of her patient and, just like him, wanted Ethan to see his dad again. He hugged her and apologized for his behavior. She proposed they get out together. He agreed, but first went to to spend time with Ethan without her knowing.<ref>[[Can't Fight This Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Paul was still unconscious and while Cristina was checking up on him, Owen came to talk to her. He told her Ethan spent the night on the peds ward to keep social services away and that Ethan's grandmother was coming today. Cristina brought up they were supposed to meet up last night and told him she wore the T-shirt that she's not allowed to wear when they're arguing because it makes him forget what his point was. He was sorry he missed it and as she said she could put it on again, Owen asked her why Paul was still out. She said he would wake up once she'd reverse the hypothermia. She reminded she said he might, or might  hours later or he might  days later. They don't have a problem until it's any more than that. Owen wanted her to talk to Russell about this, even though she assured there was no reason to. Later that day, Cristina overheard how Arizona informed Owen that Ethan's grandmother got stuck back east and that she advised him to call social services. Later that day, Meredith asked Cristina if she would take care of her kids when Meredith would start suffering from Alzheimer's, but Cristina once again made it clear that she didn't want to have kids and that she preferred to visit the kids regularly rather than raising them. She wanted to be the coolest aunt in the world, but she couldn't be a mom. Meredith later came to convince her to give her a lethal injection once she started showing the symptoms of Alzheimer's, as Derek didn't seem to want to do it.\n\nLater that day, Cristina gave Paul Dawson a bolus of D, as it might help him to wake up. Owen asked her why she didn't talk to him first. Because she talked to Russell about it like, he asked. He brought up that she knew he was concerned about the case, but she questioned if there had to be three highly-trained surgeons supervising one man's recovery. He said they work as a team at the hospital, and while she brought up she had been too busy teaching the Syrian doctors to overthink perfectly straightforward post-op care, he told her that the next morning, she would round on Paul with him and Russell. Meredith came over to Paul's room and Cristina told her Paul was going to wake up in a few days, so they could all relax about it. She told her that she Owen maybe didn't like being Chief because lately he was all about Russell not supervising her and she thought that may be because he missed teaching and that the administrative crap made him lose touch with medicine. In the evening however, she and Meredith watched Owen talk with Ethan in his room. She said this must be why he'd been acting so crazy lately. Meredith pointed out that kids make you crazy and Cristina agreed. Meredith said it looked kinda cute though, which Cristina did not like hearing.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a board meeting, Jackson told the other board members that the CDC, which was brought in to examine a post-operative infection that spread among  of Bailey's patients, asked them not to discuss the investigation with Bailey, so they had to avoid her that day. All thought it was ridiculous and they were opposed his idea to put out a statement. Meredith also asked her to be in her corner when she was giving birth, but Cristina declined because people poop on the table during childbirth. Throughout the day, Cristina teased Alex about his feelings for Jo, suggesting he punch Jason to take back his girl. Owen and Cristina ended up in an elevator together and agreed to celebrate in an on-call room after surgery. She asked him about Ethan's grandmother, who had arrived earlier that day. He told her she was sweet but useless, but that was not a problem as Rachel, Ethan's mother, was doing better. Cristina said she did neurological exams on Paul and she had a good feeling that he'd wake up soon. Owen kissed her and thanked her for the good feeling she had. He also advised her to agree to Meredith's request, as seeing a baby being born is like watching God in person. Cristina then told Meredith she would be there and hearing that Meredith would suffer more than her, as she'd know Cristina saw her poop on the table, made her feel a little bit better. She walked into Owen and she told him she was sorry about Paul's wife. He barely reacted and she asked if he was angry with her, but he was just angry at the situation. Cristina suggested they go home to relax a little, but he wanted to stay in case Paul's condition would change or Ethan would need something. He just didn't feel like he could leave and asked her what she would do. She replied she would go home because she was his doctor, not his family. He still decided to stay and she told him she understood. At the end of the day, Cristina had a meeting where Bailey was found to have spread an infection due to microtears in the gloves, which were implemented by Pegasus' protocol. The blame was all on the gloves and Bailey could return to the OR once she was infection-free, which was the best outcome, Cristina told her. That night, Alex came to talk to her and he confessed indeed loving Jo. On her turn, she confessed that she thought she was losing Owen, not today, but soon.<ref>[[Sleeping Monster]], x</ref>\n\nOn the eighth day of Paul's coma, he still hadn't woken up. Cristina didn't like that the family overheard her saying the number of eight days, as they now got their hopes up while it could also be a few days after the eighth day. She started thinking about other treatments she could have followed, but she concluded the therapeutic hypothermia was the only right one. Following his confession, Cristina helped Alex to avoid Jo. Meredith informed her Bailey had locked herself in her genome lab because she was mad at all of them for the CDC thing, which prompted Cristina to go talk to her. From outside the lab, Cristina explained the situation and without Bailey answering, Cristina came up with the idea to go global. She called several international hospitals to ask about their trials regarding waking up coma patients, but without success. The entire board later tried to apologize to Bailey, but she continued to ignore them all. When Ethan was brought in with an overdose of sleeping pills, Cristina suddenly realized that zolpidem is a gaba agonist and that they could reverse the effects. She and Owen went to Paul's room to give him zolpidem, which triggers the gaba pathway. In normal brains this causes drowsiness, but when there has ban a chemical balance disturbance, the drug can reverse the effect. They waited next to his bed for an hour, but it didn't work. Owen got angry and frustrated because a social worker was going to take Ethan away as his grandmother, who suffered from cataracts, couldn't take care of him anymore. Cristina showed up at Ethan's room and assured him that they were trying anything to wake up his father, telling him not to give up on his father. Cristina watched how Owen started comforting the crying boy and left in pain. At the end of the day, Cristina and Owen snuggled in an on-call room and she brought up he changed. She knew he still wanted a kid. He convincingly said he wanted her and kissed her passionately to shut her up, though once the kiss ended, both of their faces clearly showed that they both knew she was right.<ref>[[Do You Believe in Magic]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Cristina replied to [[Nancy Dawson|Nancy Dawson's]] questions about withdrawing care for her comatose son Paul, Owen got mad at her for having told Nancy that it was unlikely that Paul would ever wake up. This pushed Cristina to try even harder to wake up Paul, resulting in finding a small blood clot on a CT scan of Paul's head. Derek informed her that taking out the clot could wake him up, but might also kill him. He asked if the family wanted to take the risk, so Cristina went to ask Nancy, who agreed to the surgery. Derek performed most of the surgery, during which the basilar wall dissected. Derek was forced to leave Heather to finish the surgery when he had to check on Meredith. Cristina was worried about Heather finishing the surgery, but she did good. After the surgery, Derek honestly said that he thought the surgery had done more harm than good. Cristina sighed and started beating herself up over the fact that she hadn't seen the clot earlier, but Derek assured her she did what she could. However, soon after, Paul did wake up and Cristina enthusiastically went to get Owen. Instead of being happy, Owen was visibly disappointed when he saw Ethan and Paul together and ordered an immediate transfer to Seattle Pres. Cristina later talked to Meredith about Owen's disappointment and how close Owen was getting to the kid. She then heard from Meredith that Owen had been thinking about taking Ethan and that he seemed ready to do so. Cristina asked what she could do about it, but Meredith said there wasn't anything she could do.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\nCristina and Owen both were on the elevator to the rooftop with Ethan and his father, who were ready to be transferred to Seattle Pres. Cristina watched Owen take care of Ethan and once they boarded the helicopter, she asked him he could pretend this wasn't an issue. She told him again he wanted kids, but he assured her he just wanted this one kid. She said him lying to himself did not make her feel better about him lying to her, but he promised he was not lying about loving her and wanting to spend the rest of his life with her. She questioned if he would never look at her in the future and only see the things she couldn't give him. He simply asked her if she ever thought about the fact that he might now his own mind better than she did. Cristina then got paged by Meredith. Cristina went to her room and commented it was typically her to go into labor during a super storm. While Meredith was informed she needed to have a C-section, the lights died. In the complete darkness, Shane came to get Cristina as Webber needed her in his OR. Cristina only agreed if Shane took her place by Meredith's side and came to update her regularly. In the OR, Cristina found out through an ultrasound that there was a hole in the patient's heart and she had to open him up to find out where it was exactly. She initially refused, but Richard managed to convince her. Even in the dark, she managed to find to the hole in the heart with Webber's guidance by simply listening to it. \n\nAfter surgery, she thanked Richard for having made her a better doctor tonight. She left the scrub room to go check up on Meredith, only to find that Meredith was not in recovery. She went to Connie, who was already working on another patient, but she had no idea where Meredith was as she didn't know about the splenic bleed Bailey was fixing at the exact same moment. She met up with Derek and they ran to the OR, where they waited outside until Bailey finished the surgery. Derek was worrying, but Cristina listed all the things Meredith survived and concluded she would survive the surgery. Meredith indeed survived the surgery, much to their happiness.\n\nShe went to tell Owen, who wanted to go visit the Shepherd family together. She asked if he knew how much she loved him, which he did. She started talking about the joy she felt in the dark OR and that she feels like that all the time in the OR, pure joy, content. She asked if he felt like that with just her. He avoided the question, but she knew he felt that way with Ethan. He claimed she was reading way too much into it, but she told him to stop for a second and listen to his heart. He started talking about how she was the only thing he needed in his life, but she once again asked if he believed she would be enough. He couldn't reply and she apologized and said she wished it were different. He started to object, but she said it already happened. She walked out of the on-call room and even though he shouted that he said no, he didn't come after her as she left. Cristina went to Meredith's room, but upon seeing them enjoying their newborn son, she decided not to interrupt them and walked away.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a board meeting, in which Cristina's question about Dr. Boswell led to Callie outing Arizona as a cheater, Cristina laid down next to Meredith in her hospital bed. She felt like she was going to die because of the break-up and told Meredith that she ended things with Owen. Meredith thought they'd start things again as always, but Cristina assured her this time was different than the other times they broke up. She and Owen worked together again when he had to mediate between Cristina and Bailey, who differed on opinions over Richard's case. She lost from Bailey when Meredith, who turned out to be Richard's medical proxy, relied on the labs and let Bailey operate. Before Owen was going into surgery with Bailey, Cristina gave him instructions and put them in Owen's phone, even though he told her it wasn't necessary. He kindly told her she was a challenging person, which she already knew. Cristina went back to Meredith's room, where Meredith asked her to say she made the right decision. Cristina let go of her professional opinion and told Meredith she did.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith wanted her to assure her again, which Cristina did. They then waited for news on Richard and Heather. When the latter died, Cristina and Owen went to tell Stephanie. The interns got the night off to mourn Heather's death, so Cristina took over one of Stephanie's patients. While discussing the patient with Owen, he blurted out he wished he had known their last time together that it was their last time together, as he would've done things a little differently. He described their last time together, and after they agreed it wasn't their best work, they rushed off to an on-call room to have sex. When Cristina went back to Meredith's room, Meredith noticed something in Cristina's hair, which an ashamed Cristina quickly covered up. Later, while informing Owen on her patient again, he said he was glad they had given each other a better last memory. Cristina said that if they had really thought it through, the last time he mentioned hadn't been their last time. She whispered into his ear what had been, and they rushed to an on-call room again. While cuddling in bed, Cristina told Owen they couldn't stay friends as they would just continue to have sex all the time. \"Just because I am the one who said it was time, doesn't mean this is easy for me. This is not easy for me,\" she said as she started crying. After a long day of work, Cristina told Owen she was going at Meredith's house to help Callie (who moved in there) and Derek take care of the kids. Owen offered to help, but she just wished him a good night and left.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Cristina already started to miss sex. At work, Owen told her and Arizona that they, as two of the few remaining board members at work, needed to make a decision about the outpatient surgery wing, which was destroyed by the storm. During his speech, he accidentally offended Arizona, who left, leaving Cristina and Owen all alone. Cristina noticed he was stressed and wanted to comfort him, but remembered their break-up and quickly left, before something would happen between them again. Later that day, Cristina talked to Meredith about the situation with Owen, saying that nothing would change if they just kept having sex. While looking at her patient's scans with Owen, there was some romantic tension and he told her he would normally kiss her. Callie interrupted the moment by coming in to ask questions about couples therapy, but offended them both by saying couple's therapy obviously hadn't done them any good. At the end of the day, Cristina and Owen ended up in the elevator together. She told him they would eventually be drawn together again, and then proposed they both date other people. She admitted it would feel forced, but it might help them to get over each other and she made him promise to at least try it.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nAt the fundraising party that was organized to get money to repair the hospital after the super storm, Jackson informed them that % of the money would go to the department of the surgeon who'd raise the most money. Both Owen and Meredith came to complain to her, and she told them it was simple. They just had to be charming, using the same skills they'd use if they wanted to pick someone up at a bar. She knew Meredith knew how to do that, and she'd get Owen to practice if they were serious about meeting new people. She then spotted a guy which she nicknamed Richy Rich, whom she kept on complimenting and flirting with. While she was getting the guy another drink at the bar, she interrupted Owen and Emma's conversation and chased Emma away, telling Owen he wouldn't get money out of her. She advised him to go after an old lady wearing Chanel and returned to Richy Rich with a drink. Some time later, she went to get another drink for the guy. At the bar, she met Alex and told him that every drink she served the guy would mean another zero on the check he'd give her. She had so much that night, reminding her of her intern year, in which they played dirty and stole surgeries. They didn't get to do that anymore now. While treating the victim of an accident at the party, Cristina wondered if Richy Rich was watching, as they looked awesome taking care of the patient and that would mean even more money. She was paged to the hospital to operate on [[James Carlson|a tamponading junkie]].\n\nIn surgery, she called Shane a shark, as he did a pericardial window on his own in the ER. She assured him it was a good thing, as all good surgeons were sharks: you see what you want, do whatever it takes to get it, like her. She told him to never apologize, as sharks don't do that. She allowed him make the decision on how they'd continue the surgery, and he chose the risky move, which she pulled off successfully. After surgery, she met up with Richy Rich and flired with him some more to get him to give her check. Once he did, he proposed they got out of the hospital, but refused it was all about the money for her, unlike what he thought. She flirted with him all night to get him to write this big check, only for nothing in return. He asked her if she didn't even feel a little bit bad about that, which she didn't. He proposed she could sleep with him for free, but she just smiled and walked away with the check. \n\nShe met Owen on his way out of the hospital and told him she understood he didn't want to date other people, as people were gross. She said they looked great though and asked him to go to Joe's for a drink, just as Emma walked in. She came to talk to Owen, who was charmed by her. Noticing Owen's interest in Emma, Cristina said she was just heading out and left the two of them to talk. Once outside, she was seemingly disappointed that Owen managed to find someone new so fast and turned her down for his new love interest.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith and Cristina briefly fought over the fact that their lives had led them to two different places. Meredith ultimately believed that Cristina did not think Meredith could be as great a surgeon as she could because Meredith focuses on being a parent as well as a surgeon. Eventually, their fight ended.\n\n\nCristina began a trial where she used Meredith's D printer to create conduit hearts to help children. Her research led to her nomination for the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], which bought her more recognition for her trial.\n\n\nThough she was told she was the front runner by [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]], she still lost the award. Later, it was revealed that she had all the votes to win. It was the connection the hospital had with the foundation that cost her the award. It is impossible for anyone working at the hospital to win a Harper Avery Award.\n\n\nThe loss of the Harper Avery Award kept on haunting Cristina at the hospital. The other doctors wanted her to use her recent success in the medical community to appeal new surgeons and investors for the hospital. When telling [[Sabine McNeil]] that her children needed to go home in order to properly heal, she herself realized that she needed to get away from the hospital for some time to get over the loss. She told Meredith she needed a day where it was all about her trial and not about the Awards or its financial consequences for the hospital. She then followed Meredith and Owen's advice to give a lecture about her trial at another hospital, and accepted an offer to travel to Zurich. They thought she needed time to figure out what she was going to do next. After spending four days in her hotel, she fell in love with the city. During the lecture, it turned out that it had been [[Preston Burke]] who made her come to Zurich. Initially resentful given their history, she ultimately accepted his offer to scrub in with him as she had also followed his work over the years. He showed her some of his hospital's cutting edge techniques, such as holographic hearts in the OR and  -D printers.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Cristina realizes what she wants to do next.]]\nSeeing all these techniques, she suddenly realized that printing a functioning, beating human heart is what she wanted to do next. He said she could do that at his hospital, as he had an endless amount of fundings and had the material to do what she desired. After overthinking the job offer, she refused later that night, as she suspected some ploy to get her back in his life. However, he revealed he was married and had kids now. Even though he acknowledged her life had changed too and that he didn't know her anymore, he admitted she had become a magnificent surgeon and everything he dreamed she'd be, which moved her. He told her she should be in a place like this hospital and asked her to consider his offer again. That night on the phone, she told Meredith about the offer and that everything she ever wanted was in Zurich, except him being there.\n\nHowever, the next morning, before leaving, she paid him another visit and once again declined his offer. He wanted to know why, as it didn't make any sense. She told him she never wanted to work for him, she wanted to ''be'' him. Him walking away from her at the altar was the best thing that ever happened to her, as it made her stand on her own two feet. She asked why he offered her a job that he knew she couldn't resist, thinking he'd want her to chase \"the carrot\" until he'd snatch it away. He revealed he didn't want her to work for him, as that would destroy his marriage and his life. Eventually, he'd be chasing her. He repeated he did not want her to work for him, so she reminded him he just offered her a job. He then revealed he wanted her to take over from him, as he would be leaving to move with his family. She couldn't believe it at first, but it was the truth: he was seriously offering her a hospital. This place was hers if she wanted it. She then accepted the offer. She returned to Seattle, where Meredith immediately realized that Cristina accepted Burke's offer and that her person would be leaving the city.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\nBack in Seattle, Owen was supportive of her decision, but Meredith suspected he was up to something. Cristina volunteered to interview replacements for [[Jeff Russell]], her boss. None of the applicants seemed fitting, but Owen told her they couldn't all be like her. When Meredith heard about the interviews at lunch, she thought that was Owen's plan: making her meet applicants she wouldn't like so she wouldn't leave and offering her the job at the end. During the last interview, Cristina was asked about the Harper Avery Award, which was the applicant's goal. She told him he'd never win it, as the only goal of the Award's winners is to make patients better using innovative techniques. In the evening, Owen joined her to make a decision. He proposed to ask the Foundation for a large infusion of cash into the cardio department so they could attract higher category talent. Cristina hushed him and asked him not to offer her the job. He confessed he wanted to for a week, but he didn't because he knows she has to go. They both realized nothing good could come out of him asking her to stay, so he wouldn't ask her to. However, he did ask her not to leave him until she had to leave, after which they ended up kissing again.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\nAfter putting off her departure multiple times awaiting a heart for [[Lincoln McNeil]], the day finally came to leave. After drinking with Meredith, she spent one final night with Owen. She promised him they'd have a goodbye at the hospital and then left for the mall to go buy a European phone charger. However, there was an explosion at the mall before she arrived, worrying Owen. She turned out fine at the hospital, where Meredith told her about her move to D.C. and Arizona informed her that a heart had become available for Link. She scrubbed in with Alex and reminded him of how good he is, suggesting he was putting all that talent in a drawer by taking the job at the private practice. Unbeknownst to him, she had laid him an envelope on his bed, leaving him her shares of the hospital. She requested that [[Maggie Pierce]], her new boss, prep Link for her.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith says goodbye to Cristina.]]\nWhile scrubbing in, Meredith joined her and Cristina explained that she needed to perform the transplant in order to feel finished. Meredith pointed out she didn't need to feel finished since she was just taking the next step in her career, and she promised she'd help Cristina leave. As the donor heart was delayed, Cristina had to leave before the surgery. She hugged Derek on her way out. As she allowed Shane to come with her per his request, she hugged and thanked Bailey and Webber. She then rushed off to wave at Owen from the gallery as he was operating. Meredith then got her in the cab just as the heart for Link arrived and told Cristina she loved her, after which the cab drove off.\n\nHowever, Cristina made a brief return as she had thought of the perfect way to say goodbye to Meredith. She dragged her to an on-call room and said they needed to dance it out one last time. Before dancing it out, they made arrangements to keep in touch and Cristina asked Meredith not to let Owen get all dark and twisty and to mock Alex once in a while. She also asked her person not to be a hero since Cristina needs her alive. Meredith makes her brave. They then danced it out. Right before leaving, Cristina finally said what had been bugging her. She told Meredith that while Derek was very dreamy, Meredith was the sun, a surgeon with an extraordinary mind, so she shouldn't let what Derek wanted eclipse what she needed. She then left for the airport and flew to Zurich.\n\nShe settled down in Burke's former office and decorated it with pictures of Meredith, Derek, and Owen. Shane came to get her for their first staff meeting.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nCristina came back to Seattle to stand with Meredith at Derek's funeral and hold her hand. Alex later reached out to her when Meredith disappeared, but Cristina hadn't seen or heard from Meredith since.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nThe night Meredith won the Harper Avery Award, Cristina called her while she was about to celebrate with Alex, just in time for the champagne. Alex and Meredith opened the bottle and Cristina asked Meredith if she felt different, to which Meredith answered she did.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Sam Bello]] was forced to leave the country because she was a dreamer, Cristina agreed to take Bello in as a surgical intern at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] and have her work under her.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after Meredith's \"Hospital From Hell\" article was published, Cristina texted Meredith encouraging her to move to Switzerland before Miranda killed her.\n\nCristina sent a letter of support for Meredith for her medical license hearing, where she stated that Meredith was the only one she would want to operate on her if she was dying, that she was the sun and was unstoppable and that she would fix the broken system.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref> As a congratulatory gift, Cristina sent [[Cormac Hayes]] to Seattle.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\n\nCristina is incredibly focused and driven (even more so than the others) and is always excited about the chance to scrub in on a surgery. Extremely competitive, she is not above stealing and hijacking patients if it means getting in on an exciting surgery. Cristina has excellent surgical skills, and is the intern with the most medical knowledge. However, she has difficulties conveying her feelings and dislikes being touched by anyone, including her mother. She also has a poor bedside manner and finds it hard to empathize with most patients.\n\nCristina values logic and practical thinking above emotional reasoning, but has undergone several emotional situations since becoming an intern. She has been described as cold, cut-throat and hardcore, which she defines as her \"edge\" and has helped her during her internship but has caused emotional problems in relationships such as with [[Preston Burke|Burke]] and [[George O'Malley|George]] who describes her as a \"robot\". Because of the traumatic experience of watching her father die, Cristina is unable to handle the emotional loss from the thought of losing her loved ones. While she initially grappled with the concept of expressing her feelings, Cristina has gradually become more comfortable with sharing her inner thoughts. Nevertheless, she is still considered the least emotional of all the interns.\n\n[[Image:OldC.jpg|thumb|left|Old Cristina.]]\nDespite her strong personality, when Meredith was unconscious after falling into the water during the ferry crisis, Cristina fled after she realized she could not deal with the fact that her \"person\" was dying. Burke encouraged her to confront her feelings, and she burst into the trauma room and insisted that the doctors try to revive Meredith again. Meredith soon woke up, and an overwhelmed Cristina happily told Meredith that she was getting married to Burke, and Meredith was the one person she wanted to tell.\n\nIzzie tells Cristina about her cancer, and asks her not to tell anyone else. Cristina pulls every favor she possibly can and sets her up with the best surgical oncologist in Washington state, but Izzie blows it off, annoying Cristina. When confronted, Izzie is apathetic about the cancer, which makes Cristina wonder why she told her. While helping Izzie, Cristina becomes increasingly distracted on the day of her solo surgery and eventually told an OR of Izzie's illness, including Bailey and Alex.\n\n\n\nWhile at Stanford Medical School, she began a romantic relationship with the renowned cardiothoracic surgeon and her professor, [[Colin Marlow]]. This relationship lasted for  years throughout her medical degree and the relationship ended as she finished medical school.\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Cristina after her miscarriage.]]\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\n[[Preston Burke]] gave Cristina a cup of coffee, causing her to be taken aback by the gesture. Later, touched by the fact that Burke admitted to having made a huge error in a surgery, Cristina followed Burke into the on-call room and locked the door. They proceeded to have sex. The next day, Burke tried to get Cristina to define their relationship, but a commitment-phobic Cristina brushed him off. She later found out later that she was pregnant and immediately scheduled an abortion.\n\nUnable to deal with her emotions about the pregnancy and abortion, she distanced herself from a bewildered, frustrated Burke, telling only Meredith about her pregnancy, as she was her person she had put down in case of a medical emergency. Meanwhile, her covert relationship with Burke came out into the open after [[George O'Malley|George]] saw them kissing and told Meredith and Izzie. After the Chief told Burke that he could only be interim Chief of Surgery if he was prepared to sacrifice his personal life, he decided to break up with Cristina. Although she pretended to not care, Cristina was hurt by his decision and decided against telling Burke about her pregnancy. However while in surgery with Burke, she collapsed from an ectopic pregnancy and her left fallopian tube burst.<ref>[[Make Me Lose Control]], x</ref> Burke was shocked to find out about the pregnancy, but Cristina reminded him that he broke up with her. Despite that, he was the only one whom she allowed to comfort her when she could not stop crying from her grief.\n\nThe couple reconciled and officially became a couple.<ref>[[Bring the Pain]], x</ref> When Cristina and Burke went on their first official date out of the hospital, they realized that they have almost nothing in common. Burke also noted that Cristina is \ucvery hard to get to know\ud and she agreed. Although their relationship was dysfunctional, it was still going strong as they were clearly in love with each other.\n\nAnother obstacle in her relationship with Burke was their different beliefs. Burke is moderately religious and believes in spiritual traditions, while Cristina is a strong atheist who believes only in science and openly scoffs at any superstition and spiritual ideas. When she first found out about Burke's spirituality, Cristina was shocked, believing that a surgeon with his level of ambition and medical skill wouldn't have anything but a purely scientific mind. She began looking down on Burke for beliefs she considered irrational, while Burke was hurt and angry she wouldn't accept his spirituality. This clash in belief caused tension between Cristina and Burke, but it was subsequently resolved.\n\nCristina\us commitment issues resurfaced when Burke gave her a key to his apartment and asked her to move in with him. She felt that they did not know each other well enough yet, but Burke convinced her to open up to him. Cristina introduced Burke to her extremely messy apartment and lifestyle, but Burke accepted her for what she was. She eventually agreed to move in with Burke, but secretly kept her old apartment. The truth eventually came out and Burke was mad that Cristina had lied to him. Burke later confronts her, and talks to her about how competitive and stubborn she is, while he still loves her. Cristina replied saying that she gave up her apartment twenty minutes ago.\n\nWhen George had a disastrous sexual encounter with Meredith and moved out of her place, Burke invited him to stay at his apartment. Cristina was jealous that George was able to relate better to Burke than she could, and she devised a way to make Burke kick out George himself. Insisting on her right to be comfortable in her own home, she went about naked in the apartment, and Burke was forced to evict George from their apartment.\n\nLater, Burke became mad at Cristina when she unwittingly fell asleep during sex.<ref>[[Damage Case]], x</ref> During this conflict, Burke prevented Cristina from scrubbing in on several surgeries. This outraged Cristina, who hated the fact that her love life could have such a large impact on her work life. However, this argument ended abruptly when Burke was shot in the arm. When sent to the surgery room to help Burke during his intense, painful surgery, she panicked and fled, her turbulent emotions preventing her from acting. This event would impact her deeply, for she knew it wasn't like her at all to be controlled by her emotions in such a way. Later, she eventually returned to his side and held his hand.\n\nBurke\us recovery was not smooth-sailing and he discovered that he had developed a hand tremor. Burke later confided to Cristina about his hand tremor, and she told him that no-one has to know. They devised a covert partnership to hide Burke's tremors from the other doctors. In her best supportive way, she managed Burke\us surgery schedule and scrubbed in on all his surgeries, so that she could take over whenever his hand became too tired to proceed with surgery. However, her exclusivity to rare surgeries incited jealousy and suspicion from the other interns. George subsequently witnessed one of Burke\us hand tremors, and confronted Cristina about it. She frantically denied it, but suffered a crisis of confidence and eventually confessed everything to the Chief.\n\nCristina\us actions jeopardized Burke\us chances of becoming Chief of Surgery, and Burke saw this as a huge betrayal. Both parties refused to talk to each other after the fallout, jeopardizing their relationship. Cristina eventually broke the silence, and Burke asked her to marry him. Cristina was stunned and only accepted his proposal after eight days of hesitation. However, she refused to wear the ring he gave her, saying she doesn\ut do rings.\n\nCristina's life was further complicated when her former professor and lover, Colin Marlow, arrived at Seattle Grace. In a bid to win her back, he repeatedly came onto her and tried to sabotage her relationship with Burke. On top of that, he joined the race for Chief of Surgery, so as to compete with Burke and impress her. Cristina resorted to acting extremely affectionate with Burke, after direct attempts at getting Marlow to leave Seattle Grace failed. However, Marlow was not convinced by this and used the opportunity of a rare surgery to lure Cristina to his side. Marlow humiliated Burke in the operating room by belittling Burke's knowledge of cardiothoracic surgery, and relegated Burke to just observing the surgery. After the surgery, Cristina comforted him. Unbeknownst to her, Marlow witnessed the entire thing, telling her she had compromised herself for Burke, and was no longer the competitive and driven person he fell in love with. She responded by saying that she's learned that \"sometimes you have to think about other people.\"\n\nFollowing Burke's departure at the altar, she is devastated and remains so for a long time. Matters are not helped with the new cardiothoracic surgeon, [[Erica Hahn]], hating her. [[Jane Burke|Mama Burke]] apologizes to Cristina for Burke as well, for losing him and her teacher, as she recognizes that Cristina loved being surgeon more than Burke and that is likely to be why they bonded so well.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nNot long after moving past Burke, Cristina was blown away by army surgeon [[Owen Hunt|Major Owen Hunt]], who arrived at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]] on the back of an ambulance and instantly managed to impress Cristina, having performed an emergency [[Medical Glossary#T|tracheotomy]] with a pen in the field. Noticing the bleeding gash in Major Hunt's leg, [[Richard Webber|Chief Webber]] ordered Cristina to take care of him. He then managed to impress her even further by stapling up his own leg without any kind of anesthesia. Later the same night, Cristina was impaled through the abdomen by a falling icicle outside the hospital, and Major Hunt found her and carried her inside. As he treated her, the two bonded, and she was visibly disappointed when he turned down Chief Webber's job offer and told that he was due to return to Iraq soon. Hunt left, but not before giving Cristina a passionate kiss.\n\n[[File:Crowenkiss.jpg|thumb|px|left|Cristina and Owen kiss.]]Two months later, Cristina was surprised to see Major Hunt sitting at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]], and the next day, she found out that he had been hired as the new Head of Trauma at Seattle Grace. Cristina panicked, not wanting to get involved with another attending. She tried to avoid him, which turned out to be unnecessary, as he had seemingly forgotten her name, calling her \"Cristine\". Cristina later confronted him about this, and he told her that in Iraq, his entire platoon had been killed in an attack, which was why he had decided to move on from everything that belonged in the past, including Cristina. \n\nAfter this, Cristina and Owen tried to act casually around and towards each other, but sparks were in the air. Cristina even opened up to Owen about the death of her father, an event that drove her to do surgery and be the best. After a patient special to Owen died, Cristina tried to offer him her condolences, but he got upset, first threatening Cristina, then kissing her. Cristina was startled, and the two started to avoid each other again, until one day Cristina found him sitting on the doorstep outside her building. She sat down next to him and he told her that she was beautiful. Not long after, Cristina lost the solo-surgery, so Owen took her to [[The Vents]], which cheered her up and the two kissed. \n\nThe relationship begins to blossom, with glances across rooms and stolen touches, like a Victorian romance novel, inspired by [[Ellis Grey's Journals]], but they soon hit another roadblock when Owen's ex-fianc\ue turns up at the hospital and it is revealed that Owen broke up with her in a two-line email. Owen admits to Cristina he is not proud of that, but he is a different person than he was, and he is terrified of what people would think when they see him now, especially his mother, as he is not the person they sent to war.\n\nOwen was quick to declare his feeling for Cristina after his return from the army, after the experienced had changed him. He confessed he wanted to wanted to be around in  years to \"rip the scalpel out of\" Cristina's hands after she becomes to old to practice, though they only had two failed attempted dates at that point.              \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|right|]]\n\nCristina accepts they move forward, until Owen's psychological damage from war begins to manifest itself as PTSD, first throwing Cristina into a shelf, requiring her to get stitches, and then strangling her in his sleep. Callie and Meredith take the defensive and prevent Owen from seeing her, but Cristina claims she is fine. The two have a moment and consummate their relationship, only for Cristina to break up with Owen because she is terrified of falling asleep next to him.<ref>[[Elevator Love Letter]], x</ref> Cristina was missing a cardio attending to teach her, so as a gift to her, Owen brought a new cardiothoracic surgeon to Seattle Grace, [[Teddy Altman]], a friend of his from the army. Teddy later confessed her love to Owen, which complicated Cristina and Owen's relationship a bit. \n\nThe love triangle between Owen, Cristina, and Teddy wasn't settled until the hospital was invaded by the murderous gunman [[Gary Clark]]. Owen and Teddy made it out of the hospital with a patient, but after realizing that Cristina was still inside, Owen made his decision and ran back to the hospital to find her. He then found Cristina in an OR where she was operating on Derek, who had been shot earlier, with Jackson, Meredith, and April - and with Gary Clark holding his gun against her head, ordering her to stop operating. Owen then tried to distract the gunman from Cristina, even yelling to him as he was about to shoot her: \"That is the woman that I love. You shoot her, you touch her, and I will kill you!\" The situation became even more dangerous when Meredith stood up, ordering the gunman to kill her instead of Derek. As the barrel of the gun moved to Meredith, Owen jumped towards Clark, forcing the shooter to shoot him instead of Meredith. After the gunman had gone, Cristina, not knowing the extent of his injuries, urged Meredith to save Owen. Luckily, it turned out the bullet had only pierced his shoulder, and in the wake of the disaster, Owen and Cristina got back together.\n\nAfter the shooting, Cristina suffered from PTSD and Owen took care of her, eventually proposing to her. Not long after, they got married in front of all their friends in a ceremony held at Meredith's and moved in together, purchasing an old firehouse that they decorated. Cristina later found out that she was pregnant with their child. Owen was thrilled, but Cristina, not wanting to become a mother, told him that she was going to have an abortion. Owen tried unsuccessfully to talk her out of it, and ultimately kicked her out of their home for failing to give him a voice in the matter. However, Cristina found herself unable to go through with the abortion without Owen's support, which alarmed Meredith, who, after telling him what sort of miserable future would await both Cristina and the child if she kept it, convinced Owen to let Cristina have the abortion. Owen held Cristina's hand during the procedure, but the moment seemed bittersweet and involuntary. \n\nIt soon became clear that Owen was not okay with it. He and Cristina grew apart, he became more and more distant and silent, until the situation finally exploded during Zola's birthday party. Owen and Cristina got into a huge argument which ended with Owen accusing Cristina of killing their baby. After this, the situation only grew worse, and during a session with a marriage counselor, it became clear that they both failed to understand each other's point of view on the baby issue.\n\nOwen's discomfort and anxiety eventually led him to get drunk and have a one-night stand with a patient's friend. He confessed his infidelity to Cristina, who had earlier suspected him of having an affair with nurse [[Emily Kovach|Emily]] Kovach, which completely devastated her. Owen moved out of the firehouse and Cristina started to plan to move to Minnesota and accept the fellowship offer at Mayo Clinic. However, before leaving, she slept with Owen one last time, forgiving his infidelity. \n\nAfter Cristina and the others had been rescued from the forest in the wake of the plane crash, Owen promised to take care of Cristina, who was in a psychosis. He took her to the firehouse and managed to get her to speak. After she had fully recovered, she left for Minnesota to pursue her fellowship, while Owen stayed back in Seattle to continue his role as Chief of Surgery. After Cristina's mentor, Dr. Thomas died, she returned to Seattle and tried to make efforts to reconcile with Owen. Due to a lawsuit against the plane company, Owen asked Cristina for a divorce, which would help the surgeons with their trial. Cristina then told Owen she wanted to try again and he agreed, but they still went through with the divorce for the sake of the lawsuit. Their newfound happiness was short-lived, however, as the arrival of -year-old [[Ethan Dawson]], with whom Owen bonded, made it very clear that Owen still wanted children. Cristina then realized that she would never be able to give Owen what he desires, so she left him. They later got back together for a short time after Owen broke up with [[Emma Marling|Emma]] after cheating on her with Cristina. He reassured Cristina that he did not want kids, just her, but Cristina knew that he still wanted them. Cristina broke up with Owen again as she wanted him to have kids and she could not give them to him, leaving them both devastated. When he found out that Cristina was moving to Switzerland to run a hospital there, he asked her to be with him until she had to leave.\n\n[[Darren Parker]]\nWhile in Minnesota, Cristina had sex multiple times with Dr. Parker. She never truly liked him, but she missed sex. Cristina and Meredith referred to him as her sex friend, although Cristina stopped having sex with him when she found out he had been using her to get Dr. Thomas fired. After Dr. Thomas died while operating with Cristina, Parker tried to reach out to her, but she ignored him and flew back to Seattle, resigning from the hospital. \n\n[[Shane Ross]]\nWhile working closely together with Cristina, Shane overheard her saying that she needed to be at her best at work. She initially refused when he offered to sleep with her. However, when he defended her against Meredith, with whom Cristina had a serious fight at the time, she kissed him to thank him. They continued to have sex in the on-call rooms from time to time, but this ended as soon as Shane went crazy in the OR.\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith and Cristina met in the locker room on their first day of internship after discovering they had the same resident. Their [[Katie Bryce|first case]] together was a very complex case, and they worked together to find a solution and bonded during the process, but their relationship was strained after Meredith got credit for the work they did together. Over the course of their internship and residency, they deemed themselves each other's [[Person(s)|persons]].\n\nThey had their first big fight after Richard Webber blamed Cristina for knowing about the interns' secret meetings and Meredith did not defend her. Meredith even insulted Cristina by saying that to some people things came naturally, but Cristina was one of the people that had to practice. They constantly ignored each other, until Meredith broke down over the execution of a murderer, and then they made up. They started to repair their friendship over reading diaries written by Meredith's mother, when Meredith compared Cristina to Meredith's mom, Ellis Grey.\n\nCristina was often there for Meredith during her worst times and vice versa. Meredith was the only person who knew about Cristina's pregnancy, and Cristina about Meredith's. Meredith was also one of Cristina's pillars of support when she suffered from PTSD as a result of the shooting. They leaned on each other constantly and stuck with each other no matter what.\n\nMeredith was Cristina's maid of honor during both of her weddings. When Cristina had a panic attack after Burke left her at the altar, Meredith helped her get out of her dress and hugged her, telling her it was okay.\n\nWhen Cristina was still in Seattle two weeks after accepting the position as director of cardiothoracic surgery in Switzerland, Meredith told her that she had been stalling and needed to leave. She said that she needed to finish something and that she and Meredith were not finished. Meredith got her a cab and watched Cristina leave but Cristina quickly came back to the hospital. She said they needed to dance it out one more time, which they did.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\nShe sent Cormac Hayes to Meredith as a \"gift\". Later, Cormac revealed to Meredith that Cristina had spoken of a \"twisted sister\", guessing that it was Meredith. Meredith shrugged and smiled.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nCristina and Callie were roommates. They got along very well and supported one another when they were going through hardships with Owen and Arizona.  \n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nCristina and Alex lived together for a period of time. Cristina called Alex \"evil spawn\". Alex went to Cristina for help with Jo after she was hit. Cristina left her spot and shares on the Hospital Board to Alex Karev.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nCristina and Izzie's relationship got off to a rough start after Cristina made a comment that Izzie must be the model.\n\nCristina was the first person whom Izzie told about her cancer.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nGeorge and Cristina were both residents with one another. While not as close with one another as Cristina and Meredith or George and Izzie the two considered each other close friends. The two often had their ups and downs as George was upset with Cristina following the news that she had helped Burke through all his surgeries and was willing for him to operate on her father. Eventually this cooled down and he was able to forgive her. Following George's death Cristina along with the other residents were hellbent on trying to believe that John Doe was someone else. Cristina's grief manifested in form that she tried to distract herself by sleeping with Owen. At the end though after the realization that George was dead it can be seen that she was deeply saddened at the loss of her dear friend.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Cristina and Burke in surgery.]]\nCristina is a graduate of Smith College. She earned her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, and she earned her M.D. from Stanford University, where she graduated first of her class and with a . GPA. She has an exceptional knowledge of surgery and medicine, with an expressed interest in [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]].\n\nCristina's biological father died when she was nine years old in a car accident; Cristina watched her father bleed out before help arrived, attempting to close his chest with her hands, to try and stop the bleeding. She claims that this is the reason she became a doctor and is very likely to be the motive behind her interest in cardiothoracic surgery.\n\nCristina Yang became a [[Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] at Seattle Grace after graduating from medical school. On the first day of the internship, she hit it off with [[Meredith Grey]]. Cristina soon fell out with her because she felt that Meredith was given surgeries because of [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] favoritism and her famous mother, Dr. [[Ellis Grey]]. However, Cristina apologized to Meredith and the pair soon became fast friends. Her frequent sarcastic remarks and lack of tact made it hard for people to like her, but her fellow interns gradually took to her ways and became friends with her as well.\n\nAs per [[Preston Burke|Burke's]] instruction, she went to check on his patient Denny Duquette. She was shocked to find out that Izzie had cut his [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire in order to secure him a new heart. Against her instincts, she stayed and together with Meredith and George, helped Izzie in her endeavor. Soon enough, Bailey stumbled upon their plan and banned them from surgeries until someone admitted to cutting the LVAD wire. To her own surprise, Cristina insisted on sticking together and helped prevent the truth from coming to light. When the Chief decided to interrogate each intern individually, Cristina begged to Chief to tell her how to regain her business-like focus, saying that she's become an emotional wreck, the complete opposite of who she'd once been. She asked the Chief to tell her how to avoid being emotionally-affected so that she could continue being a great surgeon, but he refused, saying that he did not want to be responsible for her becoming less human.\n\n[[File:xCristinaInPeds.jpg|thumb|left|px|Cristina in peds.]]\n\nCristina hit a rough patch in her career when [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Hahn]] replaced Burke as Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Dr. Hahn made her work through her way in the cardio program, often being very harsh at Cristina, stating that despite clearly having talent, she believed that constantly praising her abilities was of little benefit to her development as a surgeon. [[Richard Webber|The Chief]] noticed the situation after [[Freedom, Part |Cristina pulled off a procedure to prevent the cement boy from dying]]. Then, [[Rise Up|Hahn left]] and Cristina got her groove back in heart surgery. Later, it was revealed that [[In the Midnight Hour|Cristina was the solo surgery winner]] but she was revoked off the prize because of the intern problem and awarded the surgery of an amputation to Alex. She finally got the solo surgery, which was a hernia repair, but she didn't focus a lot on it, seeing as she was busy trying to set Izzie up with an [[Rebecca Swender|oncologist]].\n\nAfter news of the Mercy West and Seattle Grace merger, Cristina decided to go into [[Pediatric Surgery|peds]] to protect herself as everyone else was safe. Meredith had Derek, Alex was Bailey's new favorite, Izzie had cancer, but she had nobody. She found it hard to work in peds, unwilling to play games, and when she was asked to get a chocolate pudding, she ate the last one. However, in a surgery, she witnessed Mark and Arizona reattach an arm and she found herself impressed.\n\nCristina remained determined to specialize in cardio and was an ecstatic resident in [[Teddy Altman|Teddy Altman's]] service. After the shooting, however, during which Cristina was held at gunpoint as she operated on and saved Derek, Cristina was traumatized and found herself unable to focus on her work and perform surgery for months. Cristina quit and briefly worked as a bartender, but eventually returned, finally able to be in an OR again.\n\nFollowing the completion of her residency and [[Board Certification|board certification]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|general surgery]], Cristina took a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship at The [[Mayo Clinic]]. She was dismayed to find that [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]], one of her board examiners, whom she viewed to be incompetent and out of touch with modern medicine, was also a surgeon there. After failing to integrate into the environment there, Cristina is assigned to work with Dr. Thomas until future notice. She soon found that he's actually quite a remarkable surgeon, with many things to teach her. She started to enjoy working with him. When she found out that [[Darren Parker|Dr. Parker]] planned to force him into retirement, she defended [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]]. She [[Beautiful Doom|did a surgery]] with [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]] while he was on probation. The surgery was ultimately successful, but [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]] unfortunately died while operating. Saddened by his death, Cristina drank all the tequila from her \"Bug Out Bag\" and flew back to Seattle, where she moved into [[Meredith's House|Alex's House]], then owned by [[Alex Karev|Alex]]. She returned to work at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] and immediately worked to instill fear into the interns.\n\nWorking under the new [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Cardiothoracic Surgery, [[Jeff Russell|Dr. Jeff Russell]], Cristina has been granted more autonomy as a [[Fellow|fellow]] than her previous experience at Mayo. She was instructed to basically run the cardiothoracic department, take point on cases, and to only defer the interesting cases to him. Later, she forces Russell to rely on her for his research.\n\nShe is currently the Director of Cardiothoracic Surgery/Chief Medical Officer at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] in Zurich, Switzerland, a job which she took over from her ex-fianc\ue [[Preston Burke]] when he decided to move to Italy with his family.\n\n\n*She was the first to call Dr. Shepherd \"[[\"Mc\" Labeling|McDreamy]].\"\n*When Cristina had her surgery for ectopic pregnancy, the OR Board said she was  and her blood type was AB+.\n*She is dyslexic. Yet, she managed to be a straight A student through college and ended up graduating top of her class at Smith College, Berkeley, and Stanford.\n*Cristina won the first solo surgery but was not allowed to perform it. It was the first solo surgery where all the attendings chose the same resident. She then chose Alex to perform it.\n*She prefers to drink coffee from the cart outside the hospital rather than the cafeteria coffee.\n*Her cooking skills are a bit questionable.\n*Cristina hates musicals.\n*She loves wine and tequila.\n*She has two earrings in her right ear at all times, but only one on the left.\n*She is the godmother to [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]], [[Zola Grey Shepherd]], and [[Derek Bailey Shepherd]].\n*When comparing Cristina to drinks, Mark called her a cheap wine. Shepherd called her a single malt scotch and Owen later agrees with this.\n*She can speak French (in the French version, she can speak Italian).<ref>[[Do You Believe in Magic]], x</ref>\n*She lost her virginity at the age of  to her Chemistry TA. He was a whole head shorter than her, but he was very smart.\n*When saving Derek's life during the shooting, Jackson suggested saying a prayer, but Cristina denied this, because \"''a prayer is completely useless right now\"''. Instead, she used Derek's usual phrase before cutting into his chest ''\"[[It's a Beautiful Night to Save Lives|It's a beautiful day to save lives. Let's have some fun]].\"''\n*She doesn't want to memorize her interns' names. In [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season four]], they got numbers (, , , and ) and in [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season nine]], they are named after the  dwarfs.\n*When Cristina transferred to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] from the [[Mayo Clinic]] to complete her [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship program]], Owen offered her an annual salary of $,.\n*She thinks neurosurgeries are boring.\n*When [[Erica Hahn]] was blackballing her from her service, Cristina considered exploring other [[Specialties|specialties]] like [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic surgery]], however, Cristina likened it to carpentry.<ref>[[Physical Attraction...

For the lab, Owen stabbed four live pigs and told the doctors to save their lives. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural to practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting outside an on-call room trying to get some sleep, Dani, Steve, and Ryan heard a loud, painful moan when Mark broke his penis. Later, while they watched his surgery, they gossiped about who might have broken it. Sadie eventually confessed, despite it actually being Lexie. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Warren Kramer]] came into the ER with an object lodged in his rectum, Steve, Pierce, and Ryan all laughed over his predicament. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. Ryan, Lexie, and Steve reached the finish line at the same time, but Lexie gave the correct diagnosis, making her the winner. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nRyan survived the first round of cutbacks, but was worried when the Mercy West residents started at the newly-merged hospital. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nHe participated in a documentary someone was making about doctors at the hospital.

However, after they slept together, her parents fought and her father returned to the United States. ''(\"[[One Day Like This]]\")'' When Teddy found out she was pregnant, she came to the United States to tell Owen. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nTeddy went to Owen's place to profess her love for him, but found [[Amelia Shepherd]] and Leo there alone instead. While she was there, her water broke. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")'' Shortly afterward, her labor started. Amelia timed her contractions and then started to drive Teddy to the hospital in her car. When they were stopped because the freeway was closed due to a crash, Amelia found a police officer to take them to the hospital. At the hospital, Teddy was joined by Owen as she labored and gave birth. When the baby was born, both Teddy and Owen decided to name her Allison. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Teddy struggled in the aftermath of Andrew's death, Owen brought her home, along with Allison. Allison struggled with this, asking for her mom and not understanding why Teddy wasn't coming. At the end of the day, when Allison cried, Teddy got out of bed and held her. ''(\"[[In My Life]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, Leo, Allison, and Scout all had a play date together with Teddy and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, Owen came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nAllison came to the park with Teddy and Owen on the day they were meant to get married. The wedding was interrupted by a bicycle accident, but they later got married at [[Emerald City Bar]].

They had to get cleared by him before they could operate. He did individual sessions with the doctors as well as group sessions with the residents.\n\nMeredith insisted that she was fine and that he should be worried about Cristina, who was getting married suddenly. However, Andrew believed she wasn't being honest and refused to clear her for surgery.\n\nEveryone else except for Cristina was easily cleared. Cristina skipped some sessions and showed up late to others. Andrew told her the hospital was willing to work with her, to get her whatever she needed. She told him she just wanted to be the kind of girl who got excited over finding the right dress for her wedding. ''(\"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\")''\n\nTired over not being allowed to scrub in, Meredith faked crying and told an emotional tale. However, Andrew still believed she was hiding something, so he just said they'd talk more about it the next day. At a later session, after telling Derek about it, Meredith told Andrew that she'd had a miscarriage. She also told him to clear her or not because she had no control over any of it. He then signed the form to clear her for surgery.\n\nTeddy and Owen spoke to Webber and convinced him to allow Cristina to operate, going behind Andrew's back and insisting that that's what Cristina needed. ''(\"[[Shock to the System]]\")''\n\nWhen his time at Seattle Grace came to a close, he referred the remaining cases to [[Katharine Wyatt]]. He recommended that Cristina be put on light duty in order to continue her recovery. ''(\"[[Superfreak]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Andrew came back to Seattle later, Teddy started seeing him again. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona's]] wedding with Teddy. At the reception, he told her that he'd been offered a permanent position at Landstuhl Medical Center and accepted on the condition that they find a job for Teddy as well. He asked her to go with him. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\n\nHe and Teddy planned to leave, but when day they were meant to fly, a plane crashed into the sound, so they stayed behind to help. He offered his services as a trauma counselor. At the end of the day, he wanted to spend the night in a fancy hotel. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\nAfter accepting a job at Landstuhl Medical Center, he moved to Germany. Teddy was supposed to go with him, but she decided not to and instead stayed with Henry. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nWhile he was at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], he had a brief relationship with [[Teddy Altman]]. They met in the cafeteria, which meant it wasn't a conflict of interest for him as she was never his patient.\n\nWhen [[Arizona Robbins]] asked Teddy what Andrew was like, she realized that she did most of the talking and Andrew listened, which made her worry that she was treating him like a therapist. She went to him with her concerns and he said that listening to her is not work. ''(\"[[Shock to the System]]\")''\n\nWhen he knew she'd be leaving, she started to avoid him because she'd gotten attached to him. However, before he left, he found her and said she chose men who weren't available for whatever reason. He told her she deserved more. ''(\"[[Superfreak]]\")''\n\nWhen he returned to Seattle, they resumed their relationship and he eventually asked her to come with him to Germany when he was offered a position at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\nShe accepted and prepared for the move to Germany. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\nThey were supposed to fly out one day, but stayed when a plane crashed. They offered their services. At the end of the day, Andrew suggested they go get a hotel room and spend the night in the bath, saying that when something like that happens, you want to spend time with your loved ones. Their relationship ended when she chose to remain in Seattle with [[Henry Burton]]. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith initially had a contentious relationship with him as he would not clear Meredith for surgery upon her return to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. Meredith believed that he was negligent in clearing other staff, especially Meredith's husband, [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]]. Despite Meredith's feigned attempts at remorse or distress, he continue to deny Meredith's return to surgery as he believed that Meredith was not being honest with him. It wasn't until Meredith revealed her miscarriage that he cleared her, and Meredith no longer begrudged him.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhen he cleared [[Lexie Grey|Dr. Lexie Grey]] for surgery, Mark vehemently disagreed as he interrupted a session with [[Alex Karev|Dr. Alex Karev]]. Mark yelled at him due the circumstances that led to Lexie's psychiatric-hold and that clearing Lexie was a mistake. Calmly, he responded that Lexie's psychotic-break was due to sleep deprivation and she no longer posed a danger to herself or anyone else around her. Mark accepted this explanation and backed off without further incident.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nRichard held him up in high regard, given his reputation for [[Psychiatry|trauma counseling]]. Despite requests from Meredith, Richard did not override his decision to clear Meredith for surgery and advised Meredith to continue working him until he has assessed that Meredith was fit to return to surgery.\n\n\nDr. Perkins is a renowned [[Attending|attending]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], specializing in trauma counseling, a form of psychotherapy. Dr. Perkins usually offered his services on-site and would remain until his patients were cleared.\n\nDr. Perkins consulted at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] to clear the [[Specialties#Surgical Specialty|surgical staff]] involved in the hospital shooting. Once they were cleared, he referred [[Katharine Wyatt|Dr. Wyatt]] to oversee the cases upon his departure, should any issues arise.\n\nEventually, Dr. Perkins was offered a permanent position at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, located in Germany. After considering the offer, he accepted.\n\n\n*[[Henry Burton|Henry]] referred to him as a professional white knight on a horse.\n*He is left handed.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nAndrewPerkins.png|[[With You I'm Born Again]]\nAndrewPerkins.png|[[Shock to the System]]\nxAndrewPerkins.png|[[Superfreak]]\nxAndrewPerkins.png|[[It's a Long Way Back]]\nAndrewPerkins.png|[[White Wedding]]\nxAndrewPerkins.png|[[I Will Survive]]\nxAndrewPerkins.png|[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.png\nx-.png\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Andrew Perkins Appearances}}\n[[de:Andrew Perkins]]\n[[fr:Andrew Perkins]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Perkins, Andrew}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She has an older brother, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]], and an older sister, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]].\n\n\n\nEllis was likely conceived the day before her father died, as her parents decided to have another baby on that day and then tried and did have one.\n\nAfter her father's funeral, her mother took her siblings and left Seattle for the duration of her pregnancy, leaving only a note that said, \"The kids and I are safe.\" for friends and family. Despite a placental abruption, which caused Meredith to bleed severely when her water broke, Ellis was delivered successfully in San Diego. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")'' \n\n\nShortly after her birth, her mother and siblings returned to [[Seattle]]. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Meredith was attacked by a patient, Arizona and Alex brought Zola, Bailey, and Ellis in to see her. However, the three of them were too scared by her appearance and the visit was brief. After she had recovered, the family was happily reunited at home. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Thatcher died, he left presents for Ellis, Bailey, and Zola in his closet. Meredith took those present to her kids and told them about their grandpa. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nFor Halloween, she was a ballerina. Her mother got out of jail that day too late to go trick or treating with them, but in time to help them sort candy. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, she stayed home with her brother and sister, [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]], and her new cousin, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] while her Mom treated COVID patients at the hospital.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, Ellis attended her brother's birthday party that year where he stuck his face right in the cake and then licked the icing off his fingers and made a big production of it. This made Ellis, Zola, Meredith, Amelia, Link, and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] laugh, something no one had been doing for a while because of the pandemic and the new baby keeping everyone up all night. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nWhen Amelia realized she'd missed Link's birthday, she convinced the kids to watch a movie by saying it was Link's birthday wish, giving them some free time. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith was hospitalized with COVID-, Ellis was eager to talk to her. They were able to talk over Amelia's phone on video chat. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nShortly after Andrew died, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis had a dance party in the backyard while the grieving adults supervised and tried to figure out how to tell the kids, who had loved Andrew. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nBailey and Ellis stayed home with Maureen while Maggie took Zola to the hospital to see Meredith in the hopes it would help encourage her to wake up. While they were gone, Bailey and Ellis made a fort. When Link and Amelia returned, they asked to be let into the fort. Bailey and Ellis denied them entry without the password. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her pulmonary studies showed a remarkable improvement in her lung capacity and her labs came out clear, Meredith was discharged from the hospital. Instead of leaving to a fanfare, she had Jackson slip her out the back and drop her off at home, where her kids greeted her happily. Because she hadn't told anyone she was coming, the kids' welcome home poster was unfinished, but she appreciated it anyway and asked her kids to tell her everything that had happened while she was gone. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith tried to regain her strength after spending so much time in the hospital, she and Ellis tossed a ball back and forth in the backyard. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn August , Ellis attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. However, at the wedding, Maggie's father and Winston's grandmother opposed the wedding, wanting to wait until more people could attend, so the wedding was postponed. Ellis immediately asked if she could get cake and was delighted when Maggie said she could. In April , a new wedding was planned and they all attended. Ellis walked down the aisle with her mother and siblings to spread flower petals at the start of the ceremony. During the reception Ellis, along with both of her siblings, held engagement rings for Link as he proposed to Amelia on the beach after the ceremony. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")'' \n\n\nWhen Meredith got stuck in Minnesota when snow caused her flight to be canceled, Amelia was left to cook the meal alone as well as care for all four children by herself. When Link came to drop off Scout and learned this, he decided to stay and help. When he discovered that the oven wasn't on and the turkey was not cooking, he helped her change the meal plan. The kids happily ate the replacement meal when Link said he'd pardoned the turkey. While they ate, Zola asked what an AVM was and Amelia explained. Bailey then asked what sex was, shocking the adults.\n\nAfter dinner, Link and all four kids had a dance party. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\n\nAs Christmas approached, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis helped their mother decorate a Christmas tree at their house. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith traveled to Minnesota to finish up the report on Hamilton's surgery and then spend the weekend with Nick, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis spent the weekend with Maggie and Winston. While fighting with Ellis over a stuffed animal, Bailey ended up cutting his knee. Winston told the kids they were going to play Emergency Room and Zola helped him clean and bandage Bailey's knee. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith returned home from her trip to Minnesota to present Hamilton's case to the staff at the Mayo, Nick came with her. They brought pizza to her house and he met her three children. She offered him chocolate pudding surprise, which she had made, telling him the surprise was gummy worms.  ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith held a dinner party at her house so that everyone could get to know Nick better, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis attended the party. While they waited for dinner to be ready, they played in the backyard with Amelia and Kai and then played hide and seek. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nEllis went trick or treating with her siblings and cousin, Scout, on Halloween. She dressed as a chef ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\nWith the move incoming, the whole family started preparing for the move. When a lightning storm hit, Maggie and Winston stayed at the house with the kids packing things while Meredith worked. They told the kids to stay inside, despite Zola noting the low odds of them being struck by lightning. Later, the kids were scared when lightning struck the house, starting a fire. They quickly evacuated and were reunited with Meredith outside as they watched the firefighters of [[SFD Station |Station ] try to put out the fire.

He eventually was the perpetrator of a mass murder at the hospital.\n\n\n\nAlison had cancer and went in for surgery. At first, it seemed that the surgery went well, but there were complications. Gary was devastated when his wife had to be taken off life support. He was insistent that she could wake up, despite several doctors' professional opinions stating otherwise. Alison had signed forms three years prior to her death stating that if her survival was dependent on machines, she would like to be unplugged and allowed to die. Gary would not accept this as it was so long ago that she signed the forms. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\")''\n\n\nHe filed a lawsuit against [[Derek Shepherd]] and [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] over the death of his wife. Derek's lawyer stated that Gary had no case, as the hospital had acted in accordance with her advanced directive. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\nMr. Clark, grieving heavily, proceeded to stage a hospital killing spree. He purchased a gun and a large amount of ammunition. On his way to the hospital, he was in a car accident with [[Pete (Season )|Pete]]. When Pete got out to give Clark his insurance information, Clark shot him. He then proceeded to the hospital, where he tried to get someone to direct him to Derek's office. After being dismissed several times, he went into a supply closet, where he asked [[Reed Adamson]] to help him. When she said she was a surgeon and therefore too busy for him, he shot her in the forehead, killing her instantly. When [[Alex Karev]] came to investigate the gunshot, Clark shot him in the lower chest. He then met [[Cristina Yang]] on an elevator and she gave him directions to Derek's office, not knowing why he wanted to know.\n\nGary then went into an open area near a nurses' station where he shot [[Vivian (Sanctuary)|Vivian]] when she told him he couldn't leave the area.\n\nHe continued to move around the hospital, making his way to the floor where [[Mary Portman]] was in a room with Bailey. Charles Percy entered her room, saying the shooter was on the floor. Mary was frightened when Bailey looked through the window and saw Gary coming their way after shooting a security guard. She told Mary to play dead and covered her with the bed sheet. Charles hid himself in the bathroom and Bailey hid herself under Mary's bed.\n\nClark entered the room and started crying because he thought the hospital had killed another patient, like his wife. He pulled open the bed sheet and she nervously played dead and tried not to breathe. He was about to leave the room when he heard a noise in the bathroom. He discovered Charles, who confessed he was a surgeon. Gary then shot him in the abdomen and also pulled Bailey from under the bed. However, she said she was a nurse and Gary apologized and left the room after reloading his gun.\n\nHe then found Derek on the catwalk. Derek initially didn't recognize him, but then told him to find someplace safe. Clark told him that nowhere was safe in that hospital and held his gun up to Derek. Derek talked to him for a moment about how he was human and he was flawed. He finally got Clark to lower his gun when April came out of the office onto the catwalk and startled him. He then lifted the gun again and shot Derek in the chest. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nAfter shooting Derek, he aimed at April, but she talked to him, telling him about her life, showing him that she was a human being, and he told her to run. He then left the area when he saw members of the SWAT team.\n\nHe found [[Lexie Grey]], who was taking blood back to [[Alex Karev]]. He told her what he had intended to do, which was to shoot Derek, Webber, and herself. He went to shoot her, but he before he could, he was shot by a member of the SWAT team and Lexie ran away safely.\n\nFrom there, he went to peds, where he told [[Callie Torres]] he was bleeding. [[Arizona Robbins]] told him that there were only children in that ward. Callie gave him bandages and told him to press them to the wound to stop the bleeding. He took the bandages and left.\n\nFrom there, he went to the OR where Cristina was operating on Derek. He tried to get her to stop, but she refused. Meredith then offered herself up as the eye for an eye, saying that Lexie's her sister, Richard sees her as a daughter, and Derek's her husband. Cristina stopped him by telling him Meredith was pregnant. When he hesitated, Owen tried to charge him, but Clark shot him. Jackson then told Cristina to stop operating and disconnected his leads, making Clark believe Derek was dead. He left and once he was gone, they started operating again.\n\n\nFrom there, he went to the room where his wife died and he sat by himself. He realized that he only had one bullet left. He wanted to shoot Richard and then shoot himself, but he only had enough bullets for one of them, which caused him to want a drink from the flask he'd brought in place of additional ammo. Webber poured out the vodka in his flask and talked to him, saying that killing him wouldn't get him justice. He'd get arrested and taken to prison, but if he shot himself, he'd be free and might get to see his wife again. He shot himself rather than be arrested.

An MRI showed that the damage went all the way down to her lumbar spine. They operated to decompress her spine, but during surgery, she suddenly lost signal to all four limbs. Toby was told that their mother would be paralyzed from the neck down. ''(\"[[Add It Up]]\")''\n\nThe doctors came to Kari and her child with a new treatment that was being tested which involved stem cells being directly injected into her spine. She agreed to have the treatment and the stem cells were injected during surgery.

Her interns viewed her as the dud, having heard that she'd spent some time on probation after killing someone.\n\nAfter they spent the day saving a deer with Izzie, she said that they were the dud interns.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nClaire, Graciella, Leo, and Mitch all attended a housewarming party thrown by George and Lexie. They all ended up coming to work drunk the next day. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nThe night after the party, the interns planned a darts tournament. When George invited Izzie, they started considering dropping out because they didn't want to play darts with their boss. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural to practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nLeo, Sadie, and Megan all had to work with Izzie in the clinic for a day. When they did procedures on patients, she also had them perform them on her. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns worked on Patient X (actually Izzie using her own scans and labs) and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. Leo got in trouble for making fun of the patient. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended Alex and Izzie's wedding. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen George died, Leo attended the funeral. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program.\n\nCristina had Pierce, Megan, and Leo spy on the Chief for her and report back what they saw.

His wife went to fill out paperwork for his discharge.\n\nWanting to keep his promise, Shawn decided to smoke his last cigarette in the hospital. Because he was on oxygen, lighting the cigarette caused a small fire. Shawn was seriously burned all over his face and he hit hit head, causing a small hematoma. [[Mark Sloan]] examined him and then told [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] to stabilize him and get him a CT.\n\nShawn was worried about his face, so Mark said he'd remove the dead tissue and place live cells that would hopefully take root and heal his face. However, he was warned that his face wouldn't be like before. Mark called for a neuro consult and Derek suggested a night of observation before Mark treated his burns, but Mark decided to go ahead with it anyway.\n\nThe surgery went well. Mark removed the dead tissue and applied the live cells. They were told that if the cells took within - weeks, he'd heal well. His wife was upset to hear that his face might not ever be the same as before.

Unbeknownst to him, he was followed throughout the day by Alex Karev. At the end of the day, he went to get in a cab and passed Alex. He offered to split the cab to the airport with Alex, thinking he might have stolen it, but Alex said he could have it. ''(\"[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]]\")''\n\n\nPaul showed up in the middle of the chaos caused by hospital hack at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and confronted Jo, revealing he also found out her fake name. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nPaul acted like he was happy to see Jo and that he was glad she was doing well. He introduced her to his fianc\uee, [[Jenny (Season )|Jenny]], whom he couldn't marry until he and Jo divorced. They sat down to sign the divorce papers, with Meredith present so Jo wouldn't be alone with him. After the papers were signed, Meredith took them and Paul went to leave. However, Jo saw Jenny and used Arizona and Meredith to distract Paul away from Jenny while she talked to Jenny about her relationship with Paul. Jenny denied any abuse and refused Jo's offer to help, though Jo gave her her card with her cell phone number on the back. Paul went back to Jo and told her that Jenny told him what she'd said and that Jenny wouldn't need her number, but he decided he'd keep it for himself. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nPaul later came back into the hospital after being the victim of a hit-and-run. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, he was taken for a CT, which showed a concussion. He was awake and alert, so he asked to be released from the hospital, against Amelia's medical advice. He also tried to convince Jenny to get his stuff and go with him. When she declined, he tried to get out of bed to attack her, but hit his head on the bed frame and then the floor, causing second-impact syndrome, which led to his brain swelling. He was pronounced brain dead and, wanting something good to come from it, Jo decided to donate his organs for transplant. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nHe was married to [[Jo Wilson]]. During their relationship, he was extremely abusive toward her. One incident left Jo with a broken rib and an almost ruptured kidney. Eventually, she left him and started a new life with a new name. Years later, he found out about her new identity and that she moved to Seattle and became a doctor at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. He then went there and confronted her. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nWhile he was at the hospital, he and Jo signed the divorce papers. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\nSince the papers weren't filed before his death, Jo was tasked with making his end-of-life decisions, which she used to have his organs donated. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n[[Jenny (Season )|Jenny]]\nHe was engaged to Jenny. She accompanied him to the hospital when he came to see Jo and sign the divorce papers. Jenny denied that Paul was abusive and declined any help from Jo. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\nHowever, Jenny later admitted to him abusing her and when he asked her to get his stuff, she declined, causing him to try to attack her, but he hit his head, which caused brain death. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nPaul Stadler was a [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] at Orlando Medical with a focus on abdominal surgery and fiber optics. The combination of the two is said to have forged the way for an almost new specialty in surgery.

She left Seattle to take a job at the Namboze Clinic in Malawi.\n\n\n\nShe attended [[Harvard Medical School]], completed her [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Duke University Medical Center|Duke]], and did a [[Fellow|fellowship]] in [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n\nWhen [[Callie Torres]] became pregnant, Arizona selected Lucy to monitor her pregnancy. She did an ultrasound and showed Callie, [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], and [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] the yolk sac. Callie was concerned because she was bleeding, but Lucy assured her that that's common. She agreed to run some tests, but told Callie just to live her life. However, Callie refused to leave the exam room until Lucy ruled out everything. Lucy ended up bringing up a stronger ultrasound machine, which allowed the three parents to hear the heartbeat. ''(\"[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]]\")''\n\nShe did a second ultrasound on Callie later and asked if they'd scheduled an amniocentesis, which prompted a debate between the three parents over whether or not they needed one. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\nLucy did a third ultrasound at . weeks. She said everything looked good, but Callie's blood pressure was just a little high, though she said it was due to the nerves about her baby shower. She then invited Lucy to the baby shower. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Alex came to the NICU looking for a brain dead infant whom the transplant coordinator had suggested as a potential donor for his patient, who had hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, he butted head with Lucy, who banned him from the NICU over his comments. She later saw him talking to his patient's parents in the NICU and wanted to go kick him out, but Arizona told her that Alex is a good guy and a good doctor, even if he can be an ass sometimes. ''(\"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Lucy found out that Alex needed to sign his delinquent charts to get out of the hospital in time for a basketball game, she helped him get through the charts because she didn't want him to miss the game. After they were finished, he asked her to go to the game with him, but she declined. She later watched from the gallery as he skipped the game to treat a four year old. ''(\"[[Golden Hour]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith's vision started to become blurry due to her fertility medications, Alex came and talked to Lucy about it. She correctly figured out that he was just looking for an excuse to talk to her, because if Meredith were really concerned, she'd come to Lucy herself. When Meredith's condition worsened, she did come to Lucy, who examined her and told her to stop taking the drugs immediately and got a consult from an ophthalmologist. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\n\nLucy came to Callie's baby shower, where she noticed that Alex was stealing party food and asked him about it. Later, she asked Meredith about Alex and she told Lucy about some of the things Alex had been through, saying the neanderthal act was just a front. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Callie and Arizona were a car accident when Callie was . weeks pregnant, Lucy was called in to monitor the pregnancy as they worked on Callie. She was able to find a fetal heartbeat in the ER, but when she admitted that she was out of her depth, they called in [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. Lucy was embarrassed at having been benched. ''(\"[[Song Beneath the Song]]\")''\n\n\nLucy was supposed to go to Callie and Arizona's wedding as Alex's date, but a baby she was delivering got stuck and so she couldn't make it. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\n\nShe got a job over  other applicants at Baylor in Texas. She was hesitant to take it, thinking about spending another year in Seattle. She mentioned there were a lot of factors to consider before taking the job, implicitly saying her relationship with Alex was one of the reasons. In surgery, Arizona mentioned to Alex that a doctor was needed to take over for her at the Namboze Clinic, and that he was qualified to do it. Lucy overheard the offer and got interested. Upon hearing Alex was interested too, she found out that she wasn't a factor that he took into consideration. After a talk with Arizona, Alex realized that he loved Lucy and that she was an important factor. By that time, Lucy had already taken the job at Namboze, stating career comes first. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\nLucy was part of the team of doctors to tend to victims of a plane crash. However, all but one died in the crash, so she delivered the news of their deaths to several victims' families. At the end of the day, she went to look for Alex at Joe's bar and asked him to tell her not to go to Africa. Feeling bad over getting Meredith fired, he was drinking and simply told her to go to hell.\ua''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina realized she hadn't had a period in a while, she went to Lucy, who did an ultrasound and said it looked like she was about six weeks pregnant. She asked if Cristina wanted to talk about options, but Cristina said she didn't. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex met Lucy in the NICU, but thought she was a nurse. He asked her to pass him a chart on \"a turnip\" in the nursery. She was upset by this and he told her he had a baby that needed a heart transplant, and the transplant coordinator suggested \"the turnip\" as a potential donor. She then told him she delivered the baby and she'd be in touch with the transplant coordinator and then told Alex to leave.\n\nLater, Alex noticed Dr. Fields, Teddy, Arizona, and Cristina talking to the parents so he walked in and tried to join. Afterward, he asked Arizona why he wasn't brought in earlier and Lucy told him he was off the case because of the \"turnip\" comment. Alex and Lucy watched the heart transplant from the gallery. He explained that he was sorry for what he said, but felt he deserved to be in the surgery. Lucy watched Alex standing over the heart transplant baby and smiling with the baby's parents. Arizona told Lucy she could teach Alex not to be an ass, but she didn't have to teach him to care.\n\nAt the end of the night, Alex and Lucy were in the elevator together, not speaking. Alex finally told her he was sorry about her patient. She said she was happy for his. As they walked out, he started to ask if she wanted \"to get a --,\" but she cut him off and said no. ''(\"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\")''\n\nWhen she heard about that Alex had charts to finish before he could go to a basketball game, she sat down to help him because she agreed he couldn't miss the game. In the end, she talked him into asking her and then claimed it was all just so she could see if he'd ask her to the game. ''(\"[[Golden Hour]]\")''\n\nWhen he came to her to get help with Meredith's vision, she correctly figured out that he was just trying to get a second chance with her, but couldn't just ask her out again after being rejected. He then asked her out, but was rejected a second time. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Lucy and Alex at Callie and Arizona's baby shower]]\nThey talked again at Callie and Arizona's baby shower, where she noticed him stealing food. She asked Meredith about him and she said there's more to Alex than it seems and told Lucy about what he'd been through. At the end of the night, she joined him in his trailer in the parking lot for a drink. She figured out that he had been waiting for her. Alex tried to defend himself, but she kissed him. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\nShe was supposed to go to Callie and Arizona's wedding with Alex, but she got stuck delivering a baby. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship ended when, believing Alex didn't consider her a factor in his decision of whether or not to take the job at Namboze, Lucy stepped in and took the job herself. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\n\nAfter graduating [[Harvard Medical School]], Lucy completed an [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Duke University Medical Center]]. Lucy decided to complete her [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]\uato gain OB-related trauma cases.\ua\n\nWhile at Seattle Grace Mercy West, Lucy did the initial exam and ultrasound for [[Callie Torres|Callie]] when she was pregnant with [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]]. Although the case was relatively boring for a maternal-fetal fellow, [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] convinced Lucy to be Callie's OB. Lucy was also the go-to OB consult for emergent patients.\n\nNear the end of her fellowship, Lucy applied for and was accepted into a program at Baylor in Texas. She considered staying another year at Seattle Grace Mercy West, but ultimately chose to work at Namboze Clinic as its director, taking over Arizona's old position. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\n\n*Although an [[Attending|attending]] in [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]], Lucy wore navy scrubs because she was a sub-specialist OB, undergoing a [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal]] [[Fellow|fellowship]].\n*As an attending, Lucy had a personalized scrub cap.\n*In a deleted scene of [[Song Beneath the Song]], she confesses to [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] that she came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] because she idolized Addison's career and would like to, one day, be her.\n*It is likely that the program she got into Baylor was a [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] as that would have given her the experience to adequately handle fetal trauma cases, given her [[Song Beneath the Song|inexperience]]. Furthermore, Baylor, in the real world, does offer a fetal surgery fellowship.\n*She is a basketball fan.<ref>[[Golden Hour]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxLucyFields.png|[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]]\nxLucyFields.png|[[P.Y.T.

Heart surgery would have caused his liver to fail, so they had to wait until a liver became available to transplant. Both surgeries were planned for the same day, with the valve replacement first and then the liver transplant.\n\nThe flight bringing his liver was delayed by rain, which worried Hank, but Graham believed that everything happened for a reason.\n\nThe liver arrived and was inserted successfully, but when they went to close his chest, Shane noticed some bleeding around the liver. They attempted to stop the bleeding, but Graham started to reject the liver. He was put back on the transplant list, but they were warned that in his condition, he was unlikely to get one. They estimated that he had about a week to live.\n\nHearing the news, Graham pacefully accepted it, making Shane cry. Graham, seeing this, reassured him and everyone else that that there was no reason to be sad. He had a good life, full of people whom he loved and who loved him back, and knew the doctors did everything they could to help him. If he was only going to live another week, then he and Hank would make it count.\n\n\n\nCarol\nWhen he was first diagnosed with cirrhosis, Graham was married to a woman named Carol.

Andy started to confess, but was silenced. Andy quickly hired a lawyer to counsel him. However, despite his lawyer's advice, he told what really happened. Lonnie was dying and Andy tried to put him out of his misery. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\n\nDale, Jack, Andy, and Lonnie are friends.

He was in a relationship with neurosurgeon [[Amelia Shepherd]], with whom he has a son named [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]].\n\n\n\nWhen Link was a child, he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma on his femur. It was caught late, but he was fully cured of it. He says the worst part of it was seeing his mother so sad all the time.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref> At the age of ten, he got a wish granted. For his wish, he asked for a baseball game at Shea Stadium. He loved it and discovered a great pizza place in Manhattan where he ate five times. It was the last trip before his parents got divorced.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after that trip, his parents sat him down and told him that their family was a lie and they would be getting a divorce. The divorce was tough on him as they used him as a pawn and forced him to choose sides. He spent Christmas days on an airplane so he could have breakfast with his father and dinner with his mother. He double-majored in college so they could go to separate graduation ceremonies. The only thing that remained was the tradition of their all having lunch together on his cancer-versary, the day he was declared cancer-free. It took him years to manage parents who could barely make it through one lunch without tearing each other apart.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen [[Nisha]] came into the ER with a bike attached to her after being hit by a car, Link took her as his first case at Grey Sloan Memorial. He used his past experience working at a bike shop to take the bike apart to free her. He then took her into surgery to put an external fixator on her broken leg.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nLink was later angry to learn that Jackson had taken Nisha into the hyperbaric chamber without notifying him. Link watched as Jackson worked on debriding her wound. When Nisha started coding, he figured out that the source was her external fixator, to which the infection had spread. Unfortunately, it was too late and Nisha died in the hyperbaric chamber.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nLink had the idea to make custom prosthetics with superhero themes for kids, but he needed a better -D printer which cost $, to get. He made his proposal to Alex, who approved it quickly. When [[Dave Buckley]] came into the ER with partially amputated fingers, Link examined him and then took him to the OR to amputate two of his fingers that weren't salvageable.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith showed up to work dressed up for her lunch date, Link was awed by her look.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson brought [[Rafi Elshami]] to the hospital to have surgery on tumors in his scapulae, Link scrubbed in on the surgery. When they found cancer, they planned to remove his scapulae in their entirety to save his life until Jackson had the idea to remove them, use radiation to kill the cancer, and then replace them, maintaining his quality of life. The surgery went well and Rafi's father was told he'd be okay.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\n[[J.J. Williams]] came into the ER with a broken arm after trying to climb a fence. When they did an x-ray to confirm, they saw a mass on his arm. They biopsied the mass and learned it was an osteosarcoma. Link assured J.J. and his mother that they caught it early and they'd develop a treatment plan for him. J.J. was worried about losing his hair, which Link said happened to him when he had the same cancer in his thigh as a child, so Link started cutting his own hair off and gave the scissors to J.J. to help.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nLink came to treat [[Georgia]] in the ER. She had a cut on her hand, so he checked her nerve function and said she looked good.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the wind storm, the power went out, trapping people in elevators. However, when the power came back, the elevators did not immediately start working again. Dahlia and Jackson found the elevator where [[Phoebe Moss]] was trapped with Bailey and Taryn and, with Link's help, started trying to get the elevator open. [[Jed Lundberg]] tried to stop them until he learned that the elevator contained organs for Cece. He then helped them get the trapped people out. After they were out, he tried to haul himself out, but before he completely cleared the elevator shaft, the elevator started working again and came down on his legs. They were able to get him free with his legs still attached. Link and Jackson operated and found a way to let him keep both his legs. After his surgery, Jed had nerve function in his foot, which was a sign the surgery worked.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nLink worked on the case of [[Natasha Deon]], who had fallen three floors from a hotel balcony. He confused Meredith when he decided not to stabilize her pelvis before taking her into the OR. When they got in there, he showed her why not stabilizing the pelvis would give a better outcome. He put in an external fixator and Natasha was put into a medically-induced coma after her surgery to help her recover.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nWhen he learned that the entertainment Meredith had hired for Bailey's birthday party had cancelled and Alex backed out of helping, he offered to help set up, saying he loved superheroes, the theme of the party. They set up the party quickly and Bailey was happy when he saw what they'd done. When he saw Link, Bailey asked if he was Thor and Link played along. While the party was winding down, Link sat in the kitchen with Meredith, talking and eating birthday cake.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the mass overdose, Link treated a patient in the ER who had broken both arms before moving to the clinic, checking on patients. When Betty started having chest pains, he picked her up and carried her over to the main hospital. He then put an IV into [[Linus]] to give him fluids because he had become seriously dehydrated. However, Link later found Linus in a closet with a needle in his arms. He and Amelia tried to save Linus, but were unsuccessful. Link expressed his regret to Amelia for leaving Linus unattended.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nLink was working on [[Hunter Martinez]], who had osteosarcoma in his right femur. After three months of chemotherapy, he was ready to have a rotationplasty, to remove the cancerous portion of his leg and flip the lower part of his leg to make his ankle his knee. The surgery was successful and they were hopeful that he'd be able to continue to play baseball.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\n\nLink went to the Western States Conference for Alternative Pain Relief. He was one of the presenters and talked about an athlete he treated who became addicted to opioids and later died in a car accident under the influence. Link knew he was the kid's first dealer. Despite this, he said he'd do the same thing. Amelia, who was attending his talk, walked out after hearing that. He continued and later went to her room to explain to her that he needed to prescribe the kid opioids immediately after surgery, but it should have stopped there. And he should have talked to him and his mother about the risk of becoming addicted and that's where he went wrong. The guilt over what he did caused him to quit medicine for a whole year. He came back to make it right.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nWith Amelia, Link treated [[Kari Donnelly]], who'd been in a bad accident. There was a risk of paralysis, but they believed they could prevent that. They took her into surgery and had almost finished the repair when they lost signal to all four of her limbs. They were unable to restore function and had to tell her child that she would be quadriplegic.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Link found a study that involved directly injecting stem cells into the spines of quadraplegic patients in the hopes of regaining use of their arms. He suggested this treatment for Kari, who agreed to try it.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nAfter learning from Alex that Jo had been acting different since returning from seeing [[Vicki Ann Rudin|her birth mother]], Link went to their loft to figure out what was wrong with Jo. He was able to get her to laugh and joke about their past, but when Alex came home at the end of the day, he told Alex that something was really wrong.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nLink went to New York with Amelia to operate on [[Jonah Mays]]. During their trip, they ended up having dinner with Amelia's sisters, Nancy and Kathleen, and Link tried to pass as Owen, but they were found out when their mother, who had met Owen before, arrived. Amelia and Link then left. Amelia was upset with Link knowing so much about her past, but she apologized on their flight home and they shared donuts.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n\nLink and Amelia continued seeing each other until Link realized Amelia was still hiding him from her sisters. He asked her where she saw their relationship going, as he was all in.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref> After taking some time to think, Amelia told him that she needed some time to discover who she is outside of Owen, but that Link could possibly have a place in her future.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAlex informed Link that Jo had been committed to the psychiatric department for her depressive episode. They went out for drinks and Link assured a fearful Alex that Jo was strong and that she would come out fine. He then told Alex about his break-up with Amelia. Later in surgery, Amelia noticed he misunderstood her and explained in surgery that she was just trying to put a stop to her habit of going all in too fast. She did want to continue dating him to get to know him. On a date, Amelia shared that she would like to try a threeway. He was surprised she'd never done that in L.A. as he had plenty there. Over time, they talked it over and Link consented to her going to ask Carina for a threeway.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia followed Link into a staircase and asked him to go somewhere private. He expected sex or bad news, like her seeing someone else, but instead, she blurted out that she was eight weeks pregnant with his baby. She said she didn't expect anything from him but just didn't want to keep it a secret. She also hinted at her bad track record with pregnancy but was paged away for a trauma before she could elaborate. Link was baffled and found a quiet place to process. Jo joined him and he told her. He said he hated his own childhood with the cancer and his parents' divorce. While Jo assured him that wouldn't happen to his kid since his cancer wasn't genetic, he said worrying about random cancer was even worse. He was also afraid about brining a kid into this terrible world with global warming. He wasn't sure if he'd get a say. Jo said it was Amelia's choice in the end but he for sure would get to weigh in and assured him he would be a great father. He then received word Amelia wanted to talk and went to find her in the green room. She opened up to him about her experiences with [[Christopher Shepherd|Christopher]] and how terrified it made her of pregnancy. He then told her that her experience made his imagined worst-case scenarios seem irrelevant and that the most important thing to him now was that she wouldn't get hurt. He said he's suck up his fears and be a dad if she decided to keep it or support her in any way possible if she didn't. She then abruptly left. He later found her on a bench outside and she told him his words had made her less scared and a little bit in love with him, which she attributed to the hormones. She then said she thought they would make an amazing kid and that she would like to meet it. He agreed with her.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia initially decided that she wasn't ready to tell anyone yet, but after witnessing the reunion of long lost lovers [[Bertram Hollister]] and [[Soyoung Oh]], she decided that, while it scared, the pregnancy was a good thing and she wanted to share it with their friends and family with him. Together, they went to Meredith's house to deliver the news and Meredith and Andrew congratulated them.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Link was part of the team that treated a woman who got severely injured when the frozen body of a stowaway fell from the sky and landed on her. Link in particular took care of the woman's boyfriend, who was panicking as the frozen body had basically exploded in front of him on top of his girlfriend, covering him in blood. While Link was calming him down, the man found a toe in his hood. Afterwards, he went to assist Maggie and Teddy in the OR but by the time he was scrubbed, Alicia had been pronounced dead. Link delivered the news to Josh and comforted him. He took the news pretty hard. At Amelia's, he had her lie on top of him as a gravity-blanket. He told her he was falling in love with her. While he had always associated love with pain and divorce, he liked the feeling he was having and since people were being killed by bodies falling from the sky, there was no point in trying to avoid pain. Together, they continued to lie there with their hands on her belly.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, his cancer-versary, he invited Amelia to his annual cancer-versary brunch with his parents. While they usually ruined it with arguments about whose life turned out better after the divorce, he was planning on breaking that pattern by telling them about the pregnancy. He introduced his parents to Amelia upon arrival as they didn't know that he was seeing anyone until a few hours before. Amelia said they've been seeing each other for a few months. Link said they had known each other for longer. Amelia blurted out the entire history of how they came to be together, all the way back to Maggie setting them up and her split from Owen after the ordeal with Betty and Leo. While a bit overwhelmed, Maureen understood how things could work out better the second time around. She then announced that she was getting re-married to Link's father Eric. Link was baffled. Link found out they reconnected when his father moved to Denver for work and was matched with Maureen on multiple dating apps. They laughed about it at first but then came together again. Eric asked Link to be his best man but Link scoffed and said their divorce put him through hell. He didn't know what to say but he was sure he was never going to do what they did to him to his own kid. After dropping the pregnancy bomb, he went to get some air. Amelia joined him outside and made him realize he was mostly angry at his parents for making his cancer-versary all about them. She said they could go if he wanted to or go back inside to give his parents a chance to do better. Link opted for the latter. Over dessert, his parents suggested they get married, too, but they wanted to focus on the baby. When Link mentioned they had a lot to plan before next Spring, his parents asked when exactly Amelia was due at they had put down a deposit for a venue in April. Link grew upset but his parents were willing to forfeit it. After lunch, Amelia took Link home to de-stress and presented him with an improvised cake made up out of candy bars.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nLink attended Meredith's hearing with the medical commission. When [[Paul Castello]] had a seizure there, Link and Teddy drove to the hospital to assist Amelia on the case. They took scans and diagnosed a brain bleed. Tom took on the case as Amelia didn't trust herself to operate on the man who had killed her brother. She and Link sat in the gallery as she confided in him that she had dreamt about sticking a scalpel in that man's brain. He passed away on the table before their eyes. Amelia couldn't hide her joy. He drove her back to the hotel where the hearing was and they announced the news to the other doctors. When news broke that Meredith would get to keep her license, Link congratulated her.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia's hormones increased her libido, which Link liked. Before surgery, Link learned Jo had volunteered to become a Safe Haven volunteer and wondered if that was too much too soon. She asked him to accompany her to Station  for her first-ever call but he had surgery. He offered to cancel but she declined the offer. Later, he learned Amelia hadn't had an ultrasound yet, which surprised him as he wanted to find out everything they could. While scrubbing in, he learned about Andrew's inadvertent dumping of Meredith and pointed out Andrew wasn't Meredith's equal but that didn't mean she didn't respect him. Link advised him to go set the record straight. After work, he went by Jo's place and found out she had brought the baby home. She admitted it was probably too much too soon after all.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nLink was pacing when Meredith arrived to complain to Alex about Cormac. He pointed out Jo had stolen a baby. When they were paged for trauma, they agreed Jo could sneak the baby into the nursery for a check-up and pretend he had been there all night like he was supposed to. At work, Link asked Amelia about the ultrasound and she told him the baby was healthy. Link fixed [[Taryn Helm|Taryn's]] tib-fib fracture that she sustained in the accident at Joe's bar. After the surgery, he met up with Jo in the nursery as she handed the baby over to the social worker. Jo admitted she had fallen in love with that baby a bit. He understood as he had fallen in love with his unborn child, too. Link invited her to come hang out with his kid whenever she felt like it. Later, Amelia told him she had something serious to tell him but they were interrupted by Owen and Teddy announcing their engagement. Amelia then told him they were having a boy. Link was delighted and said he wanted the name Scout in the mix.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, soon after, Amelia broke the news to him that it was possible that not he but Owen was the father of the baby. She assured him she wanted to be with Link and a paternity test wouldn't change that, which is why she told him first. She told him she loved what they had and gave him some time to think things through. He informed Jo of the situation and added it didn't change anything as Amelia didn't want a paternity test anyway. Jo was shocked and called him out on his attitude, stating he could love Amelia and be mad at her at the same time. While they were removing a swallowed fish from a man's throat, Link defended the patient, stating maybe the happy situation of the bachelor party they were celebrating caused the man to do something that didn't seem normal. Jackson pointed out even in good situations, there are things that are not okay. Link then realized he was right and decided he did want a paternity test. He paged Amelia to the plant room and told her that as well as the fact that she should have told him right away. She admitted he was right and apologized for hurting him. She asked what would happen if they were to find out he wasn't the father. He replied he would like to be the guy who said it wouldn't matter but he couldn't promise her that. He suggested they get the test and take it one step at a time.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThey agreed to meet in the plant room to discuss the paternity test results. She showed up and told him they would get the results that night. He still didn't know what the results would mean for them, specifically what if the baby were to be Owen's and if he would still want to be with her. He told her he was afraid her complicated history with Owen would shape their future. He told her he loved her but repeated that he needed to know the results. That night, he waited for her in that room again but he only received a text that she didn't get the test and needed more time.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nLink was worried as she took a couple of days off work and ignored his texts. Jo was going through something similar as Alex was not answering her texts while going through something with his family in Iowa. Link assured her he would tell her what was going on as soon as he was ready. Jo then informed him Amelia did something similar back when she was having a fight with Owen over having kids. Link ended up on an elevator with Owen, who commented on Amelia missing work. Link told him that the baby was healthy but things were complicated. Owen recalled feeling useless during Teddy's pregnancy and told him all he could do was listen and sympathize and keep trying to help. Link decided to seek out Amelia at home. Maggie answered the door and denied that Amelia was home though she assured him Amelia was okay. He asked why Amelia was hiding the results from him so Maggie clarified Amelia didn't know the results. Amelia then came downstairs and said she wasn't doing the test because she wanted to raise her baby with someone who would love him and her no matter what a blood test said, like her sisters. She told Link they were over and sent him home. He asked Maggie if Amelia would inform Owen, which Maggie didn't think she would. Baffled, Link walked away.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nLink let himself go and stopped shaving, though he did continue to show up for work. He made a comment to Maggie about Amelia in front of Teddy, which made her suspicious. After work, Link went to offer Jo some company and doughnuts. She was disappointed to see him as she had been expecting Alex. She told him she had called [[Helen Karev|Helen]] and found out that Alex never went to Iowa. As she broke down, she said she truly believed Alex had left. Link comforted her.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref> She moved in with him as she couldn't bear to be in the loft by herself. He went to pick up some of her stuff and found a letter from Alex in the mail. He brought it to her at the hospital and offered to sit with her as she read it, which she turned down. He returned to the lounge when she finished reading Alex's goodbye letter. He offered to take her day drinking but she chose to work, though she planned on drinking at the bar after work. He told her she was his hero as she put on her white coat and took off for surgery.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Link and Amelia reconcile as he finds out the baby is his. ]]\nJo moved in with him as she couldn't bear to live in the loft by herself, which distracted Link from his problems with Amelia. He decided to let Amelia come to him if she wanted to talk. He and Jo ended up working a trauma case with her but she didn't talk to him about the baby. The patient's relationship caused Jo to realize that Alex had left her feeling worthy of love. She told Link not to blow things with Amelia, who at least had given him a choice, which is more than Alex gave her. Link then went to Meredith's house. He told Amelia that he wanted to write her a song but he couldn't come up with one as fast as he needed to come over to tell her that he didn't want to live without her. He was done feeling sad and lonely. He didn't care that the baby might not be his as loving her was all he cared about. She then kissed him and revealed that the baby was, in fact, his.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia informed all involved parties that the baby was Link's. At the same time, the Mariners started courting Link to take his old job back but he turned them down as all the late nights and travel would prevent him from spending time with his family. Link instead recommended Nico, which didn't sit well with Levi. During surgery, Link informed Levi what the job entailed exactly and advised Levi to tell Nico how he felt about it. That night in bed, Amelia told him that they could make it work if he wanted to take back his dream job. He told her he had new things in life that he loved more. She found it scary that dreams had to be put on hold for their kid, so they vowed to always fight for their dreams as much as possible.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nWith the due date approaching quickly, Link realized that life as he knew it would change forever. Link and Owen operate on a Lisfranc fracture together. Link admitted he was nervous that the stress caused by Amelia looking for a diagnosis for Richard would induce labor. Owen pointed out the baby would be fine regardless since they were so close to term. He also truthfully told Link that parenthood is scary and that the worries that come with it never go away. Link was paged when Amelia supposedly went into labor. He rushed to her room. She told him she, too, had realized that the birth was not the finish line at all. Together, they screamed through another contraction. However, an OB fellow informed them that she was just experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions so she was good to go home.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Link meets his son.]]\nA few days later, Link found out she had a busy schedule and suggested she take it easy. She refused. However, while working on Richard's case with her colleagues, her water broke. She walked to labor & delivery herself and had Link paged. Upon his arrival, she admitted she had ignored the contractions that had started in the morning, figuring they were Braxton-Hicks again. Carina confirmed she was in active labor and went to fetch a fetal monitor. Link then showed a bag he brought with their stuff and sat by her side. As the labor progressed, Bailey came to get Link to operate on Richard, whom they had diagnosed with cobalt poisoning from his hip prosthesis. Carina assured him Amelia still had hours to go, so he agreed to go operate. With the gallery filled up, Link removed the hip and placed a new hip. The surgery went well. Link rushed back to Amelia's room, finding her in a calm state. He briefly thought it had been false alarm again but he then saw Bailey in the room holding his son. She handed him over to Link, who sat down with him on Amelia's bed.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after the birth, Meredith came to meet her nephew while his parents debated his name. They couldn't agree on one so they started saying random names to the baby in hopes of eliciting a reaction from him that would indicate that they found the right name. Since that approach didn't work, Amelia went online and read that sometimes people pick names from their dreams. When Amelia said her last dream had been a sex dream, Link cautiously suggested revisiting the subject when she was less hormonal, causing her to throw him out of her room. Eventually, they settled on [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln]].<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle in the middle of their parental leave, Amelia and Link stayed at Meredith's house with their son and Meredith's kids, while Meredith and Maggie stayed in hotels after their shifts at the hospital in order not to risk bringing home the disease. Due the chaos of raising hungry and energetic children, Link and Amelia forgot about Link's birthday. Link himself didn't remember until his mother called while Amelia was only reminded by posts on his social media. Link said it was no big deal and got back to putting together the tent that [[Winston Ndugu]] sent for Maggie to sleep in in the backyard. Amelia told they kids that Link wanted them to watch a movie for his re-birthday, which she made up for forgetting his real one, and they went upstairs to have sex while the kids were distracted. They were interrupted by their son crying so Amelia got up to comfort him. In the evening, Amelia presented Link with a plate of doughnuts. She apologized since the store had accidentally sent over gluten-free doughnuts, but he appreciated the gesture and assured her he had had a good birthday.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Meredith had contracted COVID and was admitted to the hospital, causing Link and Amelia to look after her kids. Link was happy to get a break from parenting four kids when he was paged to the hospital for a hand trauma. Upon arrival, he ran into an exhausted Jo, who had taken over running Meredith's service. He scrubbed in to repair a sex therapist's hamate fracture. Over the procedure, they discussed the importance of sex to pass time during quarantine. After surgery, the patient shared his secret: asking for and listening to what your partner wants. Link then returned home and as he undressed in the backyard to be certain not to introduce the virus into the house, a helpless Amelia broke down crying. He asked her what she wanted. She wanted sex but didn't feel safe after he had been at the hospital. They then took off their clothes and pleasured themselves in front of another while keeping their distance.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nLink kept his calm demeanor around the house, playing guitar for the kids, while Amelia was stressed out taking over Meredith's role as a parent. Contrary to Amelia, he insisted on looking at everything from the bright side. Amelia snapped that she had had enough of his pep talks and couldn't keep shoving all her negative feelings down, stating there would be no bright side to the consequences of that. He then took the time to listen to her feelings without trying to make things better. After they put the kids down for the night, he told her that when he had cancer and his parents' divorce, he had already been through a period of illness and isolation. He then met a kid at cancer camp who refused to talk about anything cancer-related and that attitude of focusing on the good stuff only turned out to work well for him, so he couldn't be her partner in misery. She understood and asked him about the song he was composing.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref> A few days later, Amelia decided to go into work to help treat Tom, who had contracted COVID. In the process of leaving, she revealed to Link that Tom was not only her teacher but also her first sex partner post-Owen.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith's condition worsened and had to be put on a ventilator, a sleep-deprived Link and Amelia had Jackson pick up Maggie and Winston so they could tell the kids about their mother's status together. Link set them all up with beers as they settled in the backyard. Scout woke up from his nap crying so Link paced around the backyard with him to calm down. He then vented that taking care of the kids forced him and Amelia to keep moving. He admitted he had started to wonder what would become of his life if Meredith were to die, going even as far as praying every night for her survival. Jackson and Winston understood him and assured him that it was okay for some of his reasons for wanting Meredith to live to be selfish. Link added he would hate for the kids to lose their other parent and then thanked Jackson for picking up Maggie and Winston despite his history with Maggie, thus revealing that relationship to Winston. <ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\n\nBecause of his history with childhood cancer, Link does not like to have stress in his life. He prevents stress by avoiding situations that he knows will end in pain and not getting too concerned about things that are out of his control. He is very laid-back, relaxed, and supportive of his friends and loved ones. He is shown to be kind, generous, and emotionally mature.\n\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nWhile looking for the quickest route to the ER, Link met Maggie, who suggested that Amelia might be good for him. He asked Amelia to have dinner with him, but Amelia was confused and quickly declined the offer to go out with him.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Betty was in surgery, Amelia broke down sobbing and Link consoled her.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref> Soon after, Amelia attended a medical conference where she ran into Link, who was giving a lecture. They flirted with each other and Amelia even decided to check out his presentation. After hearing that he prescribed opioids to a patient who became addicted and died and would do the same thing again, Amelia got upset and left. Link continued the lecture, but visited Amelia's room afterward and told her his patient needed opioids, but where he went wrong was not telling him and his mother how addictive opioids could be and not carefully monitoring him to make sure he didn't become addicted. He said he wanted to change the system to a relieved Amelia. Amelia made a move on Link and they ended up hooking up in her hotel room. <ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> After their return, things were awkward between the two of them, even though they both vowed it was a one-time thing. However, after working together on a difficult case, they hooked up again.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nWhen they went to New York for a case, Amelia's sister, Nancy, invited them over for dinner. At dinner, Amelia lied and said that Link was her husband, Owen. Link went along with it until Amelia's mother, Carolyn, came over and called them out on their lie. When all of Amelia's sisters started criticizing her, Link stood up for Amelia. On the plane back to Seattle, Amelia apologized to Link over donuts.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n\nLink and Amelia continued seeing each other until Link realized Amelia was still hiding him from her sisters. He asked her where she saw their relationship going, as he was all in.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref> After taking some time to think, Amelia told him that she needed some time to discover who she is outside of Owen, but that Link could possibly have a place in her future.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nLink and Amelia started dating again soon after she said she wanted to know him better before committing to him seriously.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref> Weeks later, Amelia tells Link she is pregnant, and tells him about Christopher. He replies by saying it's her choice and he'll be there for her in any way he can. She decides to keep the baby.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nSeveral weeks later. Amelia finds out she's further along than she thought, sparking doubt as to the baby's paternity.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref> She tries to tell him the news, but tells him it's a boy instead, to which he replies with the name suggestion \"Scout\".<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nLink is then told by Amelia that there's a chance he may not be the father. Amelia said she loves him and wants to be with him, and that the genetics don't matter to her. Initially, Link is okay with this, but after talking with Jo, he tells Amelia that he wants a paternity test.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>.\n\nLink waits in the plant room for Amelia to come with the results. She hovers by the door before leaving. He gets a text from her that she didn't run the test and she needed more time.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nLink visited her house to see if she was okay, where he finds out she isn't planning to get the results of the paternity test, because she wants someone who will love her regardless. She then ends things with him.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> After working on [[Brad Spencer]] with Jo, Jo tells him that love doesn't suck like they think it does and that Amelia gave him a choice. He then went to Amelia's house where he professes his love to her, and how she changed him and made him want to be a parent. Amelia then kisses him and says she really needed to hear that. She then tells him she got the results, and the baby is his.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nThey had a scare when Amelia began feeling contractions, but it turned out to be Braxton-Hicks.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref> Later, her water broke, and she was actually in labor that time. Link came to her side, but he was pulled away into surgery. He arrived back at her room after the birth of the baby and sits down next to Amelia with their baby in his arms.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Link and DeLuca fight over Meredith.]]Jo encouraged Link to pursue Meredith, telling him that she's a tough nut to crack, but she's worth it. He asked Meredith out, but she said she was working with a matchmaker and he wasn't on the list and wasn't the kind of guy who would be on the list. At the end of the day, he ended up putting his phone number in Meredith's phone, so she could use it just in case. Meredith later took over cutting his hair when she went to Alex and Jo's loft and found Jo cutting his hair for him.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nLink asked Meredith out for drinks. She initially declined, but after talking to Cece, she accepted.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the wind storm died down, Link found Meredith to ask about their drink date, but she looked between him and Andrew and said she was going to go home to her kids and she'd see him later, not clarifying which of them she meant.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith and Link worked together on a patient and had trouble getting along because Meredith couldn't understand Link's carefree attitude. They fought some more in the operating room until Link explained why he chose his method of treatment. After their surgery, Link volunteered to help Meredith with her son, Bailey's, th birthday party. While setting up for the party at Meredith's house, Link told her more about having cancer as a child, which gave her more insight about him. While the kids were playing, Link sat with Meredith, and they talked and ate cake.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nOn Valentine's Day, Meredith made a date with Link, which he seemed excited about. However, after [[Natasha Deon]] died, she went up to the roof to toast her with Andrew and stood Link up.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref> Meredith later told Jo that she apologized for standing Link up and that he accepted her apology.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\n[[Jules Millin]]\nLink and Jules hooked up after meeting on a dating app. On Jules' first day at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital|Grey Sloan Memorial]], she bumped into Link and recognized him from the night they spent together. Link apologized for not calling like he had said he would, but she assured him that it was okay and explained that she wasn't there for him and that she worked at the hospital. Later that day, Link met Jules outside the intern locker room and explained that he brought her some HR paperwork for her to sign, stating that their relationship predated her employment at Grey Sloan Memorial. Jules got confused and pointed out that they didn't have a relationship.<ref>[[Everything Has Changed]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jules got to scrub in on a below the knee amputation, she saw that Link had written messages on the patient's legs to indicate which leg to cut off. She mistook this for flirting and asked him if he was flirting with her over a sick patient's leg. Link quickly explained that he was being a supportive teacher and didn't want her to cut off the wrong leg.<ref>[[Wasn't Expecting That]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jules needed help recording sexual education videos, she found Link in the pit and asked him if he could help her, but he told her it was inappropriate and said that he didn't want anyone to think that he was harassing her.<ref>[[Let's Talk About Sex]], x</ref>\n\nBronwyn Murphy\nHe has an ex-girlfriend named Bronwyn who had red hair and a tattoo of the word Texas and another in the shape of Texas lower on her back. Despite this, she wasn't from Texas.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\n\nHis parents could barely afford treatment for his childhood cancer, and their marriage broke up over it.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nDespite butting heads with [[Richard Webber|Richard]] over [[Dave Buckley|a patient]], Link asked him to hang out with him and Andrew at the bar, even proposing alternate activities when he was reminded that Richard doesn't drink.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nWhen Link and Jo first saw each other at the hospital, they were over the moon to see each other again. Link knew Jo when she was still married to Paul, but Jo cast Link out. Link said that he never liked Paul, and then Jo drifted away from him.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex started out distrusting Link because he had known Jo back when she started dating Paul and he didn't protect her from him. Link explained that he tried to tell Jo that he didn't like Paul, but then Paul got jealous and made her stay away from him. Link didn't know about the abuse and thought he was just being respectful in staying away. Alex then started treating him better and they developed a friendship.\n\nThey went out for drinks together after Jo committed herself to the psychiatric department to have her depressive episode treated. Alex feared it wouldn't work as it had failed to help other people in his life. Link assured Alex that Jo was strong and that she'd make it through. He then talked about his possible break-up with Amelia.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Nico Kim]]\nHe worked closely with [[Nico Kim|Nico]] as part of Nico's training.\n\n\nHe's the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Orthopedic Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].

She believed he was genuine, but he later bragged to the other Mercy West residents that he had made her his bitch. He later apologized, stating that they could be friends outside the hospital, but not inside. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nCharles donated blood immediately before going to the ER to treat patients from a hotel fire. When he arrived in the ER, he was told to hold an axe imbedded in a patient steady. However, he fainted and pulled the axe out. On his way down, he was hit in the head with the axe and needed stitches. He was later investigated with the other doctors when [[Cathy Becker|a patient]] died under suspicious circumstances. ''(\"[[I Saw What I Saw]]\")''\n\n\nCharles worked on [[Wallace Anderson]] with [[Arizona Robbins]]. He informed her when Wallace developed another bowel obstruction and scrubbed in on his surgery with her.

''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Charles saw Reed flirting with Alex and implying that she'd trade sexual favors for the chance to scrub in, he confronted her about it, but she brushed him off. ''(\"[[Blink]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Derek Shepherd]] became Chief after [[Richard Webber]] was ousted, the Mercy West residents were all worried that he'd fire them because he hated the merger. They also gossiped about why Richard was ousted. ''(\"[[State of Love and Trust]]\")''\n\n\nA motorcyclist came into the ER after crashing. On the way into the hospital, the gurney he was on tipped over, sending him to the ground. Charles worked on his case and was able to preserve enough function to make him an organ donor.

She taught \"Reaction, Observation, Communication\" to improve their interactions with patients whose cases needed more sensitivity. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\nThe sensitivity training was required because they were expecting [[Bobby Corso]], a morbidly obese patient. The residents were told not to make jokes. Charles was kicked off the case when he suggested using a CT scan from the zoo because it would be equipped for animals of his weight. However, he was later brought back onto the case because they needed more big guys for the surgery. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:CharlesDying.jpg|thumb|left|Miranda Bailey holding Charles' hand while he passes away.]]When [[Gary Clark]] came into the hospital intending to shoot [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Richard Webber]], and [[Lexie Grey]], he also shot Charles. Charles was working on the case of [[Mary Portman]]. After the lockdown was announced, he came into Mary's room, telling them that the shooter was on the floor. When Bailey saw Clark shoot a security guard and start heading their way, she told Charles to hide and Mary to play dead. Clark came into the room. After seeing that Mary appeared dead, he was leaving when he heard a sound coming from the bathroom. He opened the door and when he saw Charles, he asked if he was a surgeon. When Charles said he was, Clark shot him. After Clark left, Bailey started to treat Charles with Mary's help. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nThey packed his wound but it wasn't holding, so Bailey said they needed to get him to an OR. They put him on a sheet and dragged him out to the elevator, but when they got there, they realized the elevators had been turned off because of the lockdown and then Bailey concluded that Charles would die. She made good on his promise to tell him if that was going to happen and said that he didn't need to be scared because they'd be with him while it happened. When he stopped feeling pain, he knew it was a bad sign. He then asked Bailey to find Reed, not knowing that she was already dead, and tell her that he loved her. He also told her to tell her he was brave. Bailey told him he was very brave. He then told Bailey she was his favorite doctor and died. ''(\"[[Death and All His Friends]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Reed Adamson]]\nHe had a crush on [[Reed Adamson]], but never told her. When they were interviewed for the documentary, she told the interviewer that they've known each other since medical school and he was like a little brother to her.

''(\"[[Suicide is Painless]]\")''\n\n\nHe claims he once didn't talk to his family for an entire car ride across the country, which took ten days and crossed fifteen states. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nCharles first met Izzie when he apologized to her about Reed taking [[George O'Malley|George's]] cubby. Izzie initially ignored him, but after he talked about his family and himself, Izzie introduced herself. Charlie later asked her if she knew the Research Library code, but Izzie declined, saying she needed every advantage she could get. Izzie then showed him around the hospital and gave him tips. After he saw Izzie talking about her IL-, he confessed that he had crush on Reed. After, she gave him the Research Library code.\n\nTheir friendship later ended when Charles bragged that Izzie was his \"surgical bitch\", since she gave him the Research Library code and did many other deeds. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nHe was one of Charles\us friends when they transferred to Seattle Grace Mercy West together and Jackson mentioned that Charles was one of his best friends not long after the shooting.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\n[[Miranda Bailey]] was his favorite doctor, something he revealed to her on his deathbed. ''(\"[[Death and All His Friends]]\")''\n\n\nPrior to the merger, he worked at [[Mercy West Medical Center]], but came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital ]]following the merger.\n\nAt the time of his death, Charles was in his third year of residency.\n\n\n*Charles was often called upon to do heavy lifting and moving due to his large size.\n*He once teased [[Callie Torres]] about flirting with a patient.<ref>[[How Insensitive]], x</ref>\n*He donated blood.<ref>[[I Saw What I Saw]], x</ref>\n*He was terrible at metaphors.<ref>[[How Insensitive]], x</ref>\n*In [[If/Then]], an alternate reality, Charles is alive, remains a [[Resident|resident]] after [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] absorbed [[Mercy West Medical Center]], and is infatuated with [[April Kepner]].\n**In the same episode, he mutters \"shoot me now\", which is ironic since that is how he died.\n*His final words were \"You were always my favorite doctor.

Link used his experience working at a bike shop to take the bike apart to free her. They then took her into surgery to put an external fixator on her broken leg. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\nLink was later angry to learn that Jackson had taken Nisha into the hyperbaric chamber without notifying him. Link and Nico watched as Jackson worked on debriding her wound. When Nisha started coding, Link figured out that the source was her external fixator, to which the infection had spread. Unfortunately, it was too late and Nisha died in the hyperbaric chamber. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\n\nNico examined [[Arthur Krug]] in the ER and told him that he hadn't broken any of the bones in his face. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\n\nNico worked on the case of [[J.J. Williams]], who broke his arm trying to climb a fence. His arm was broken, which they confirmed with an x-ray. However, the x-ray also showed a mass, which a biopsy confirmed was cancerous. They told him and his mother and J.J. was worried about going bald, prompting Link to cut his own hair and let J.J. help him. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the wind storm, Levi was sent to the clinic with Nico to clear it of patients. He and Nico argued over a patient as they worked, but Levi insisted he could handle it because he had experience. After taking a patient to peds, Nico came back to make sure Levi got back okay. After Levi said he'd wait it out in the clinic, Nico went to leave and got swept away as soon as he took one step outside. Levi crawled to him and then helped him get into a nearby ambulance. In the ambulance, Levi said he didn't know he was gay when he was young because he didn't have the opportunity to explore the feelings he had. After his speech, Nico kissed him again. Then they had sex in the ambulance. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nAfter the storm had calmed somewhat, they were startled when Alex came into the ambulance to escape the wind. They worried they'd be fired, but at the end of the day, Alex told them what they did was unacceptable and instructed them to use a room with locks in the future. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the wind storm, the power went out, trapping people in elevators. However, when the power came back, the elevators did not immediately start working again. Dahlia and Jackson found the elevator where [[Phoebe Moss]] was trapped with Bailey and Taryn and, with Link's help, started trying to get the elevator open. [[Jed Lundberg]] tried to stop them until he learned that the elevator contained organs for Cece. He then helped them get the trapped people out. After they were out, he tried to haul himself out, but before he completely cleared the elevator shaft, the elevator started working again and came down on his legs. They were able to get him free with his legs still attached. Nico helped while Link and Jackson operated and found a way to let him keep both his legs. After his surgery, Jed had nerve function in his foot, which was a sign the surgery worked. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n\nNico worked on the case of [[Natasha Deon]], who had fallen from a hotel balcony and broken her pelvis. In the OR, he helped Link repair the damage around the pelvis. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nHe spent time with his family before Christmas. He told Levi he wished he had come and Levi promised to come next year with Hanukkah gelt. ''(\"[[Girlfriend in a Coma]]\")''\n\n\nNico worked with Levi to prepare him for a hip replacement. However, the surgery was rescheduled to the mass overdose. Instead, they operated together on a woman who had broken both arms after overdosing and falling. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\n\nNico was working on [[Hunter Martinez]], who had osteosarcoma in his right femur. After three months of chemotherapy, he was ready to have a rotationplasty, to remove the cancerous portion of his leg and flip the lower part of his leg to make his ankle his knee. The surgery was successful and they were hopeful that he'd be able to continue to play baseball. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\n\nNico treated [[Douglas Hall]] in the ER. He had been in a car accident and had a broken clavicle and humerus. ''(\"[[And Dream of Sheep]]\")''\n\n\nNearing the end of his fellowship year, Nico started to look into employment at other hospitals. He specifically scheduled an interview with a hospital in San Francisco. The day of the interview, he operated on [[Josh Sterman]], injecting cement into his spine to stabilize it after a fracture. However, he made a mistake and Josh died. After this, Levi tried to console him, but he brushed Levi off and did his interview anyway. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nNico continued to be cold to Levi, even while Levi tried to be there to support him. Levi ended up backing off when Link advised him that he needed to let Nico process what had happened on his own. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nNico was paged when [[Scott Carter]] fell and broke his coccyx and also ruptured his rectum. While they were operating, Taryn came in to update him on his patients and joked about the broken butt until Nico snapped at her and sent her away. Richard then talked to him about needing to find the humor in humorous patients, though he brushed it off. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Kari Donnelly|Kari Donnelly's]] finger twitched, a sign that the stem cells might have worked, Link asked Nico to keep an eye on her. Nico saw it as a punishment, but Link said he was trying to give Nico the chance to witness a miracle, hoping it would help his attitude - Nico hadn't made progress in processing his mistake and he was rapidly developing a reputation for being unpleasant to work with. Link said he was on the verge of failing his fellowship and this was his chance to save it. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nNico was in the ER when he heard [[Soyoung Oh]] speaking Korean. He came over and told Amelia and Link that she was looking for her friend, a Bird. They had him help communicate with her as they treated her for dehydration. They later learned that Bird was actually [[Bertram Hollister]], a fellow patient who had had heart surgery. They had fallen in love in Korea and lost touch. Nico continued to translate for them as they caught up on their lives. ''(\"[[Reunited]]\")''\n\n\nOn Halloween, Nico was supposed to meet up with Levi after he got off work, but Levi got roped into planning the peds Halloween event, so Nico came to the hospital to see him instead. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing to see if she would lose her medical license, Levi forgot his tie, so Nico went to his locker and retrieved his lucky tie, which he put on Levi. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n\nNico, being Levi's only friendly social contact after the hearing, was at the bar having drinks with Levi when a car crashed into the side. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nNico immediately jumped in to help the injured and tried to encourage a panicked Levi to calm down and help as well. When they noticed that [[Blake Simms]] was under some rubble, he helped Jackson remove it so they could free him. He got vodka to sterilize the area so they could stop the bleeding. Then when he heard that the back door was blocked, he attempted to kick it open before Pruitt could tell him that a large vehicle was blocking it. Nico continued to help tend to the patients until the firefighters finally removed the vehicle blocking the back door. Then he helped evacuate those who could walk. ''(\"[[I Know This Bar]]\")''\n\nNico rode to the hospital in an ambulance with Simms. Once he was there, he ended up in surgery with [[Taryn Helm]], helping Link fix her leg. Before they started, Levi collapsed in the OR, so once they were nearly finished, Link offered to let Nico leave to go check on Levi, but Nico insisted on staying, saying Taryn was Levi's best friend and he couldn't help Levi anyway. When Taryn coded as they were finishing, they called in Bailey and Richard to take over. Nico when went to be with Levi, who was told he just needed rest. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Sullivan came into the hospital to see if he was eligible for surgery on his leg, Nico monitored his scans. When Sullivan couldn't stop moving due to the pain, Nico suggested getting a shot for the pain, but Sullivan asked him just to wait and he concentrated on keeping still. ''(\"[[Eulogy]]\")''\n\n\nNico went with Levi to visit his Uncle Saul, who was in hospice care. When Saul died immediately after Levi came out to him, Levi was upset. He then said according to Jewish tradition, he had to stay with the body until someone else arrived to take over. Nico and Levi played card games as they waited. When [[Daniel Schwartz]] arrived, they were surprised to learn that Saul was himself gay and Daniel was his boyfriend. They shared stories and then Daniel helped Levi prepare Saul's body. After this, Levi went home and started packing, telling his mother that it wasn't accepting him if she continued to refuse to let him tell anyone else in the family. ''(\"[[The Last Supper]]\")''\n\n\nNico treated [[Joey Phillips]], who had come into the hospital with a broken clavicle.\n\nLater, when Levi had a patient who was dying of metastatic cancer, Nico helped him turn the cafeteria into a dance floor so his patient and her husband could share a last dance together. After watching them dance, Levi told Nico that he was looking for a dance partner like that. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Link decided to turn down the offer to return to his job with the Mariners, he suggested that Nico apply and offered to recommend him and help him prep for his interview. This excited Nico, who was thrilled with the idea of taking the job. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Ben had the PRT parked at Grey Sloan, Nico peeked in and said it looked cool. Ben said he was welcome any time he wanted to take a shift in it. ''(\"[[No Days Off]]\")''\n\n\nA month into the Covid- pandemic, Nico was still working at Grey Sloan. After finishing a surgery, he came outside to tell the patient's wife, but couldn't find her, so he left the message with Levi, who said he hoped that Nico was doing well, though he himself wasn't. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nWhen Bailey's ankle was hurt when two patients' fathers fought, Nico came and certified that it wasn't broken, just sprained. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")'' He later confirmed with her that it was feeling better. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Dave Oyadomari]] came back into the ER after falling off a stepladder and injuring himself, Nico ended up on the case due to him having a broken collarbone. Due to his being Asian, Mabel quickly realized he'd been misdiagnosed with appendicitis during a prior ER visit and instead had right-sided diverticulitis, which had perforated after he was sent home. Owen allowed Mabel to scrub in due to her catching the correct diagnosis. After Dave's surgery, Mabel went to talk to Owen about how his medical care, which was centered on European norms, had led to Dave being seriously injured, causing him a month off work that would otherwise have been avoided. However, before she could confront him, Nico sent her out of the room, having previously advised her not to risk her residency over it. Instead, he confronted Owen himself. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Andrew had been stabbed following Opal, Levi blamed himself for having seen her in the ER and not stopping her. Nico assured Levi that there was no way he could have known. He also encouraged Levi to get someone to replace him on Andrew's case, knowing he would be too distracted to be a good doctor. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\nAfter Andrew died, Levi confided in Nico that he felt guilty and sad and angry over Andrew's death, but his go-to emotion was guilty. Nico said his was numb, which they recognized was what was wrong with their relationship. Later, they attended Andrew's memorial together and held hands as they watched the video. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nNico treated [[Erika Swift]], a patient who had broken her leg while rollerskating. He put her leg in an bandage and said she'd need a cast for about six weeks while it healed. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\n\nIn April , Nico attended Maggie and Winston's wedding as Levi's date. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nNico helped treated [[Nadia Correa]], who was injured when she flew off the back seat of a tandem bicycle she and her wife were riding after they collided with a priest. She had numbness in her legs, leading them to suspect spinal fractures. They ended up operating on the fractures as well as a tethered spinal cord she'd likely always had. At the end of the day, he attended Teddy and Owen's Wedding at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, [[Myrna Schmitt]] brought Thanksgiving dinner to the hospital for Levi and Nico. She knew they were busy, so she said she'd set up the food and they could come eat whenever they had time. Nico quietly told Levi he didn't technically have to work and could sit with her, but Levi said his mother would never let Nico leave if he did. Despite this, Nico later went and sat with Myrna, who told him stories about Levi as they ate together. When Levi finally made it to the cafeteria, Myrna left and told them both they should visit her. Nico and Levi then had their own Thanksgiving with Jo, Bailey, Richard, and Luna. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\n\nNico scrubbed in on Owen's surgery and helped repair his leg, which was severely broken in a car accident. After that surgery, he learned that Levi had lost a patient and had scrubbed his hands until they bled afterward. He found Levi sitting outside the hospital up against the building and came to sit next to him. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\n\nNico attended the M&M that was held after the death of [[Devon Gomez]]. After Levi spoke, he walked out, over Bailey's objections that the M&M wasn't over. Nico went to Levi's mom's house to see him and reassure him. Levi brushed him off saying he wasn't returning to work and they were over. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nNico treated [[Alice Tom]] after she was attacked at a bus stop for being Asian-American. While he and [[Michelle Lin]] were operating on her, they talked about their experience growing up Asian in the US and feeling like they'd never be American enough. BokHee assured both of them that their faces were American. After her surgery, he punched a hole in the wall of an on-call room. Levi came to check on him and brought him ice for his hand. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the hospital's blood shortage, he helped the residents get the word out on social media that they needed blood, drawing in several donors. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Levi Schmitt]]\nHis romantic relationship with [[Levi Schmitt]]\uabegan when Nico winked at Levi while operating, confusing Levi. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\nLater, at Joe's bar, Nico bought him a beer after a rough day. Levi wanted to pay him back and grabbed his wallet, but Nico touched his hand to stop him and said Levi could buy the next one. Nico then left, with Levi staring after him. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\nNico later came into the residents' locker room to shower despite having access to the fellows' lounge and Levi was shocked and distracted by seeing Nico with no shirt. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\nLater, Nico then asked Levi if he would be willing to get that drink that evening, but Levi said he might have plans later. Nico just said he'd be at Joe's if his thing got canceled. Later, Levi came to the bar for that drink, but Nico mostly brushed him off, confusing Levi. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\nAfter working together on [[J.J. Williams]], Levi and Nico ended up in an elevator together and they kissed. They stopped when someone else got on the elevator, but once they were alone again, Nico apologized for what he'd done. Levi said it was fine and also that it was his first time and he was happy to learn. However, Nico said he didn't want to teach him since he had already dealt with his coming out and didn't want to go through it again. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\nAfter being trapped together in an ambulance during the windstorm, Levi talked about having feelings for men before, but never exploring it because he was a nerd and never considered sex much at all. After his confession, Nico kissed him and the two of them had sex in the ambulance. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")'' They have been in a relationship since.\n\nWhen Levi's mother called while he was hooking up with Nico, Nico was upset when Levi shushed him. Levi tried to explain why his mother didn't know about Nico, but Nico wasn't persuaded and left. Later that day, Levi explained to Nico that his mother likes to talk about everything as if it's going to hurt him and he wants to lock Nico in his own eyes before inviting his mother's criticisms because Nico's his first love. Hearing that Levi loved him, Nico kissed him and they started to walk away. Levi asked if he's not going to say it back. He said he would, but he wanted to make Levi sweat for a minute first. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\nLevi learned that Nico had an upcoming job interview with a hospital in San Francisco, and expressed worry about a long-distance relationship through bringing up sports teams. While together on a case in which Nico had to fill the man's body with cement, Levi continued complaining about Nico's proposed move. Later, it was revealed that Nico made a mistake during the surgery, and the patient collapsed. Bailey ordered Levi to fix the man, as he was the grandson of a friend of hers, but things didn't go well, and the patient died. Later, Nico was about to do a Skype interview with his new prospective boss, and Levi attempted to persuade him to leave and re-schedule the interview. Nico spoke sharply to Levi, saying that he was not a failure, and implied that Levi is, which broke his heart. Levi was angered when Nico started the interview and slammed the door behind him. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nNico was annoyed that he is relegated to simple tasks in the wake of his surgical error. Levi, on a high due to him saving the Seattle Fire Chief, ran to tell Nico about it. However, Nico didn't want to hear it and was rude to Levi, and demanded Levi's help in fixing a shoulder dislocation. Later, Link told Levi to leave Nico alone, and that if he wanted to talk, he should wait for him to say so. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nNico later realized via Link that his past behavior had been unacceptable, in the wake of a fog throughout Seattle, which led to a massive car pile-up on the freeway. He tracked Levi down, only for Levi to give him the cold shoulder, which immediately turned into lecturing on Levi's end when Levi informed him that he missed him. Levi told Nico about his day, and Nico listened, which culminated in Levi informing Nico that he loved him, but he still deserved better than how Nico had treated him. Nico came clean about his anger due to his failure, and that he was jealous of other doctors in the hospital, Levi especially, due to their ability to bond with patients and have successful moments. Levi immediately told Nico that he could help him, and wanted to. Later, the two tearfully watched\ua''My Girl''\uain Levi's basement, and his mother came downstairs with chicken noodle soup. She was very welcoming towards Nico, but called him Levi's \"friend\". Levi immediately informed his mother that Nico was his boyfriend that Nico was the one who had been having a bad day. Mrs. Schmitt then offered up the chicken soup to Nico, after he informed her that he liked it, telling Levi that they would talk later. Nico told Levi that he was \"amazing,\" and Levi put his head on Nico's shoulder. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\nAfter the other residents learned that Levi had been the one to turn Meredith in, they started ignoring him, which upset him. He didn't want to go to work because of it, so Nico promised him a reward after he got through the day. At the end of the day, they were having a drink at Joe's and Nico said he could have his reward after they got some food. However, this was interrupted when a car crashed into the bar. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nNico chafed when Levi started staying with him after moving out of his mother's place while looking for a place of his own. Nico didn't feel they were ready to cohabitate and told Levi that. Later, after seeing [[Irene Sholman]] dance with her husband, Levi told Nico he was looking for his dance partner. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship was further strained when Nico didn't want Levi to meet his parents, even though they were in town. Levi said he could take the criticism, but Nico admitted he'd never told his parents he was gay, despite having told Levi he didn't want to live in Levi's shame spiral. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship continued to struggle, with them only having sex and not talking about the situation they were in. Levi expressed his desire to have a relationship that was more than just sex, but Nico blew up at him, saying that he didn't want to talk about his feelings and he didn't understand why Levi couldn't just accept that. He said if Levi wasn't okay with that, they should end things. Levi said no, he could be okay with it and they proceeded to have sex. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\nLater, when Link decided to recommend Nico for the job with the Mariners, which Link himself was turning down, Levi decided it was time to end things between them, as Levi felt he was always the one making sacrifices for their relationship. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\nAfter the start of the pandemic, Nico went to Levi. He apologized for not being a good boyfriend, but offered to provide Levi with help de-stressing, starting right away in the supply closet. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nNico's arrangement with Levi developed to the point where they had essentially resumed their relationship, to the point where the pair were comfortable joking about their history. After some weeks, Levi finally told Nico he was upset that Nico was unwilling to give any space in his apartment to Levi, even a drawer. In response, Nico told Levi he loved him and asked him to move in. In a complete reverse of their feelings months earlier, Levi made an excuse to leave the conversation without answering. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter this conversation, Levi avoided Nico for several weeks. Nico confronted Levi, asking if they were breaking up, if he wanted to see other people. Levi said he didn't. After the doctor who administered his vaccine for the vaccine trial flirted with him, Levi went to Nico's place, where he learned that Nico had been lighting candles every night in the hopes that one of those nights, Levi would show up. He confessed his love to Levi and they kissed. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nAfter Levi did two laparascopic cholecystectomies in one day, he and Nico had sex in a supply closet. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nLevi ended things between them after losing a patient in surgery, also telling Nico that he wasn't going back to work. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\nWhen Levi returned to work, the two of them had an awkward moment in an elevator. At the end of the day, Nico reminded Levi that Levi had told him to go. Levi said he had had a rough time and the difference between the two of them was that when Nico was having his own rough time, Levi kept coming back. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\nAfter treating [[Alice Tom]], an Asian-American woman who'd been attacked by a racist, Nico punched a hole in the wall of an on-call room. Levi checked on him and then brought him ice for his hand. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nHe spent Christmas with his family. He describes them as very critical of him, which is why he's never come out to them. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\n\nAs part of his training, he works closely together with department head [[Atticus Lincoln|Dr. Atticus Lincoln]].\n\n\nNico is an [[attending]] [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Shortly before the COVID- pandemic, with his fellowship ending soon, he was offered an interview to take over Link's old job with the Mariners. He either ended up passing on the job or decided to stay on as an attending at the hospital to help out during the pandemic.\n\n\n*He is the first openly gay male surgeon in the show's history. Although Levi was introduced earlier, he didn't realize he was gay until after Nico came on to him. \n*He is also the first orthopedic surgery fellow in the show.

During her third session, during which she hadn't spoken, Katharine asked her about it. She said she read a study that showed that the act of going to therapy was beneficial even if you didn't say anything while you were there. She admitted that she hadn't been sleeping during the last five weeks. When Meredith wouldn't say what had happened five weeks ago, Katharine admitted that she knew things about her because of the way gossip travels in the hospital, though Meredith denied that her problems were due to Derek. When Meredith was paged, she left the session abruptly. Meredith later came back and committed to start talking. ''(\"[[Where the Wild Things Are]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith had five minutes before her surgery, she came to Katharine to assure her that she wasn't emotionally involved with the clinical trial patients. Derek had told her not to get her hopes up, which she thought was offensive because she thought he was the one who had his hopes up. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\nIn another session, Meredith told Wyatt that when Derek's in the room, all she can think about is his tongue in her mouth. Meredith asked for therapy tools she could use to move on so she could concentrate on their clinical trial patients. They hadn't yet managed to save one and she wanted to save one, so she needed to concentrate. Wyatt told her the only way to get rid of the fantasies was to remember the reality, that he won't be kissing Meredith because he's with Rose. At the end of the day, she told Wyatt she thought she was successful and it was a good day, but Wyatt told her it was a load of crap. She drew parallels between Meredith's situation and that of her patient. She kept saying that Derek was with Rose and that meant he wasn't with her and he wasn't with her because she was scared. Meredith asked if she was calling her a coward and then left the room. ''(\"[[The Becoming]]\")''\n\nMeredith came back to Wyatt's office, but only to tell her she was quitting therapy. Meredith insisted that she wasn't quitting, but firing Wyatt. Wyatt said that her mother quit her father and she quit her life momentarily a few times. Quitting is what she knows how to do. Meredith stormed out. Meredith later returned to get her chart because she'd fired her. Wyatt told her that Meredith quit and it wasn't appropriate for her to show up unannounced. She told her to make an appointment if she wanted to unquit. Meredith later cornered Wyatt in a bathroom and was once again told to make an appointment. After Lexie ranted at Meredith and was overheard by Wyatt, Meredith agreed to an appointment at two that day. At the appointment, Meredith talked about her patient, [[Greta]], who had true love only because it was fake. Wyatt pointed out that Derek wasn't the one who gave up. It was her. She waited for him to fail so she could say that she quit. Wyatt again implied that Meredith was suicidal. She asked her about drowning in Elliott Bay and putting her hand in a body cavity that had a bomb in it. She was careless with her life, probably because her mother told her she was a waste of space and Meredith believed her. Meredith said she wanted her chart because if it said she was suicidal, it was wrong. Meredith left the session with her chart, telling Wyatt never to talk about her mother again. She later went back to Wyatt and told her that Ellis tried to kill herself after Richard left her. She'd never told anyone before. She then challenged Wyatt to fix her, because she said she's no quitter. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\nMeredith continued to tell Wyatt about her mother's suicide attempt. Wyatt told her it was okay to talk about it. Meredith said that her mother cut her wrists in front of her and then Meredith sat in a pool of her mother's blood waiting for her to pass out so she could call . It's not okay to talk about it. Meredith had to wait to call because Ellis had told her not to call before she cut her wrists, so Meredith knew she'd be in trouble if she tried to save her life. Meredith saved her life, even though she didn't want to be saved. She's angry, but not at her mother. She was angry at [[Richard Webber]] because he left her mother. Wyatt said that Ellis didn't want to kill herself and encouraged Meredith to think about it and figure it out. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nMeredith had trouble figuring it out. She said that Ellis had told her to be extraordinary. She became a surgeon, so she had all the tools she needed to figure it out. Later, while confronting Richard Webber, she figured it out. She hadn't been trying to kill herself because she would have cut her carotid artery if she were because it would have taken seconds. She just wanted Richard to come back to her, but he didn't know about it, so he didn't. Wyatt said it meant that Meredith was gifted like her mother, but she gets to learn from her mother's mistakes. Her mother wasn't talking about surgery when she told Meredith to be extraordinary. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nAfter moving in with Derek, Meredith came back to Wyatt and said she was finished. Wyatt said she was far from finished. Meredith left mid-session over Wyatt's objections.\n\nCristina came and spoke to Wyatt and begged her not to let Meredith quit therapy. Meredith later talked to Wyatt in an elevator and told her she wasn't done. She pointed out how Meredith was able to talk about her feelings, when she hadn't six months ago. She said her door was always open. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Flood]]\")''\n\n\nErica came to see Wyatt when she was being asked to operate on [[Walter Tapley]], something she didn't want to do out of fear she'd kill him. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\n\nOwen came to see Wyatt when he had PTSD in order to talk about his feelings. She tried to get him to realize that he was there because of what happened with his platoon. He later told Wyatt that he knew he was no good for Cristina and he ruined her. And he couldn't forgive himself for that. She said it was good that he was able to name his feeling, so he could start working through it. ''(\"[[Sweet Surrender]]\")''\n\nOwen and Wyatt worked together to think of three-word phrases he could say to Cristina instead of, \"I love you,\" because saying, \"I love you\" would be cruel. ''(\"[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]]\")''\n\nWyatt encouraged Owen to take things slowly with Cristina, meaning no sex. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\nOwen brought Cristina to a session with him. She told Wyatt things she knows about Owen, trying to convince her that they know each other. Wyatt said she wanted Owen to feel comfortable with her and that was the goal, not them just getting to know one another. Wyatt then asked if Owen talked to Cristina about his trauma, the war, or the choking incident. The PTSD was fed by his avoidance of talking about it. She didn't want them to get lost in the lust of it all and have him not talk about it.\n\nThey had another session together later and Cristina finally brought up the choking incident. Owen explained that it was a dream. He believed he was saving his own life and wasn't trying to hurt her. Wyatt said that was a start. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nFollowing [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] breakup with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and Derek dating [[Rose]], Meredith began to see Dr. Wyatt for sessions due to the fact she could not sleep. Meredith was unwilling to talk in her three sessions, having read that just the act of attending therapy can be helpful. But eventually she decided to talk to Dr. Wyatt and after a while she opens up about Derek's relationship with Rose, her family and eventually her mother's suicide. During the [[The Shepherd Method|clinical trial]] that Meredith proposed was taking place, Meredith found it difficult working with Derek and required some tools to get her through the surgeries that the trial involved. Following an argument over Meredith's feelings towards Derek and Rose's relationship and Dr. Wyatt's implication that Meredith was suicidal, Meredith fired Wyatt. Wyatt told Meredith that if she left she would be quitting but Meredith decided to stay and soon opens up and tells her for the first time that [[Ellis Grey|her mother]] attempted suicide ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''. Wyatt helped her explore her situation with her mother further and with Wyatt's help, Meredith realizes that her mother never meant surgery when she was told to \"Be Extraordinary\" and she was never really trying to kill herself. Meredith continued with her therapy but after Derek moved in and Meredith found she was happy with her life, she told Wyatt she was quitting. However, Wyatt insisted that Meredith's work wasn't done and they were only scratching the surface. When Meredith told Cristina about her plans to quit, Cristina approached Wyatt and asked her not to let Meredith leave. Saying barely a sentence to her, Dr. Wyatt knew it was Cristina, annoying Cristina that Meredith spoke about her in therapy, and became even more annoyed as Dr. Wyatt began to analyze her, proceeding to claim her to be a \"terrible shrink\". When Meredith soon met Wyatt in an elevator she realized there was misery all over the world and Wyatt said for the second time that Meredith wasn't done and her door is always open.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\n[[Erica Hahn]] went to her for a therapy session to receive some counselling and therapy into being able to operate on [[Walter Tapley]]. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nAfter assaulting [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] due to post-traumatic stress, [[Owen Hunt]] went to Dr. Wyatt. After a few sessions they started focusing on his feelings for Cristina and he couldn't say \"I love you\" to her so they started work on other three word sentences he could say to her such as \"Take care now\" and \"good work Yang\".\n\n\nDr. Wyatt is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. Her patients also include several staff members of the hospital, as their hospital insurance covers a couple of sessions with a therapist.\n\n\n*She has a large fish tank with some fish in her office.<ref>[[Where the Wild Things Are]], x</ref>\n*Although unseen, Dr. Wyatt was still part of the hospital staff as of [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season seven]], indicating she wasn't fired during the merger.\n*Curiously, Katharine Wyatt was seen wearing navy blue scrubs, which normally are destined for attending surgeons.

She frequently called Meredith \"Mer-Mer\" as a child and watched her grow up. Marie threw Meredith an eighth birthday party where she filled the entire bedroom floor to ceiling with balloons. Marie recalled Meredith being a \"disembodied giggle\" over it.\n\nIn her professional life, she worked on the laparoscopic biliary reconstruction with Ellis. This medical procedure became known as the Ellis Grey Procedure. The procedure was nominated for and later won a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], Ellis' second and final win. Marie, however, did not receive any credit for her contribution. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\n\nMarie came to Seattle to meet with Meredith when Meredith asked for use of her polymer in research. When she arrived, she and Meredith realized they knew each other when Meredith was a child because Marie and Ellis were best friends. They caught up on the lost time and then Meredith made her proposal. Marie was still unconvinced, and so Meredith had [[Taryn Helm]] bring out the mouse they had saved by secretly using Marie's polymer.\n\nMarie then agreed that it was revolutionary and said after she had a good night's sleep, they'd meet and talk business. However, Meredith learned shortly afterward from [[Richard Webber]] that Marie and Ellis hated each other, which is why they were no longer best friends, and that Marie had likely stolen Meredith's idea. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith asked her about it, Marie said that Ellis had stolen the idea for the surgical innovation that won her her second Harper Avery. They had developed it together, but Ellis published the research solo before Marie could publish it jointly. In exchange, Marie wanted Meredith to announce Marie's contribution publicly and change the name of the procedure to the Grey-Cerone Method. Meredith told her she couldn't undo her mother's legacy without being able to hear her side of it. Marie then decided she would use her company's resources to fully develop the mini-livers before Meredith could do so and have them known as Cerones. ''([[Old Scars, Future Hearts]])'' \n\n\nWhen Meredith gave a presentation of her mini-livers, Marie attended. During the presentation, Meredith informed everyone about Marie's contribution to Ellis' surgical method and announced that she wanted the method to be now known as the Grey-Cerone Method<ref>Although called the Ellis Grey Procedure in \"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\", Meredith calls it the Grey Method, which is how it is referred to in every other instance.</ref>. After the presentation, Marie tried to talk to Meredith, but Meredith said she'd said everything she wanted to say. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith reached out to Marie in Spain to inquire if she could help her out on her quest to find Rhnull blood for [[Gus Carter]], but to no avail. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\n\n\nMarie never married and never cared much for romantic relationships. ''([[Old Scars, Future Hearts]])'' \n\n\nShe went back to Spain after time in the US because her father wanted her to run his company. Later, she took over ownership when her father died. She considered her father's death to be timely, as he had been sick for a long time. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\nShe and [[Ellis Grey]] were best friends for many years. Marie considered Ellis to be the greatest love of her life. ''([[Old Scars, Future Hearts]])'' Sometime after Meredith's eighth birthday, they had a falling out.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMarie considered Meredith to be the closest thing she had to having children. She was very fond of her, and watched her work over the years as she grew into a surgeon. \n\n\nShe is an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]].\n\nWhen she and Ellis Grey worked together, she was sexually harassed by [[Harper Avery]] and was eventually paid a settlement as a result of that. Ellis Grey left her name off the paper publishing their work in order to win a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], which Marie was ineligible to win, ending their friendship and resulting in Marie returning to Spain to run her father\us company. At a presentation she was giving on her mini-livers, [[Meredith Grey]] announced that the Grey Method would be known as the Grey-Cerone Method to acknowledge Marie's contributions.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxMarieCerone.png|[[Games People Play]]\nxMarieCerone.png|[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\nxMarieCerone.png|[[Fight For Your Mind]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Marie Cerone Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Marie Cerone]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cerone, Marie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Because she'd been detained at the border with her mother, her father didn't know how long she'd been in pain and the detention center only gave her an antacid to treat her. She had an intestinal blockage, which they were unable to resolve with an enema. She was then taken into surgery, where they took a biopsy while they resolved her blockage. The biopsy diagnosed her with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Because her father was uninsured, but made too much money to qualify for Medicaid for Gabby, Meredith used [[Ellis Shepherd|her daughter's]] name and insurance on the paperwork to get it covered. When Richard found out about it, he was upset that she'd committed insurance fraud, but knew of a program that would kick in after  days if they could keep Gabby in the hospital the whole time, so they had to get creative about ways to justify her continuous time in the hospital. In the meantime, they encouraged Luis to go back to work to occupy his time and offered him a cot so he could sleep in Gabby's room with her. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nGabby continued to stay in the hospital. When she had to have an MRI, she was scared, so Andrew did an MRI on her stuffed kitty, Perla, first to show her that it wasn't going to hurt her. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nGabby's staging results came back and showed that it was only stage . After Bailey told them this, Catherine said the Foundation would cover her treatment and associated costs. She also shared her own experience with cancer and said they'd do whatever they could to make sure Gabby was okay. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing to determine if she would lose her medical license, Gabby came to the hearing along with her father, who testified. When Gabby saw Meredith, she ran to her and gave her a hug. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n\n\nHer father came to the United States to get settled before sending for Gabby and her mom.

She served in the U.S. Army as a [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]] at the same time as her brother,\ua[[Teddy Altman]], and\ua[[Nathan Riggs]]. She was formerly engaged to Nathan and she is raising her son, [[Farouk Shami Hunt]].\n\n\n\nMegan is three years younger than her brother Owen and grew up in Seattle with her family. The siblings attended medical school together, where they met Nathan Riggs, with whom she became romantically involved.\n\nOne summer, Megan and Owen went on a family road trip in California but Megan left the map in a rest-stop bathroom. Their father was furious and he refused to pull over and ask for directions. After hours of arguing with Evelyn and the kids complaining, their father just pulled over at a beach and they played there for hours until the sun went down. She considers it one of the best experiences of her childhood. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n\nIn  on the day of Megan's disappearance, a nervous Megan mocked Owen's difficult relationship with Beth while she, Teddy, and Owen were waiting to leave their base to fly to Fallujah. Their Colonel would announce the stratification rankings there, which could help Megan make the promotion to flight surgeon that she had been after. Megan went to get Nathan, who had been on call the night before. As she dragged Nathan out of bed, she found a necklace. He told her she wasn't supposed to find that yet and said it wasn't exactly a ring as she had lost a ring in the sink before. As he began proposing, she eagerly said yes. The two then joined Owen and Teddy to board the chopper, where Megan shared the news and showed off her engagement necklace.\n\nAt the Mobile Medical Treatment Center in Fallujah, Megan overheard other soldiers naming her number one for the strat ranking. However, the Colonel named John Matthews number one. Megan's disappointment was cut short when they had to spring into action to save wounded soldiers that had been shot by two of their Iraqi allies. As she and Owen were triaging, Megan vented her disappointment and asked if Owen had told the Colonel that she was CGO of the year. He told her he had but said those decisions were always political. Megan then went to take care of an Iraqi woman that did not want to be touched by men. The MP pointed out the woman had tried to wrestle the gun out of one of the shooters' hands. Megan learned her name was Sana and convinced her to let her examine her. After she placed a chest tube, Owen asked Megan to scrub in with him so they could celebrate her engagement, which meant their mother would have to plan two weddings.\n\nDuring their surgery, Megan wasn't shy about telling Owen to ditch Beth. Owen then brought up he was going to miss working with her if she had gotten the flight surgeon job, which he mentioned was three times more dangerous than her current job. Upon hearing him say that, she strongly suspected he hadn't recommended her but he dodged the question, only stating it wasn't his decision. They disagreed over their approach so Owen pulled rank, but Megan defied him and did it her way, which he had deemed too risky. She forced him into helping her, which led to them saving their patient's arm. Upset at him tanking her chance at her dream job, she decided not to fly back with Owen to the Green Zone and stayed behind with Teddy.\n\nAs she was relaxing on the OR table, Nathan found her and asked for the necklace back. Megan thought he had found out that she had slept with someone on a drunk night, but he actually came to get it back because it wasn't his to give. She then realized he had proposed to her with another girl's necklace. She got mad at him, though he pointed out she had just given him reason to be mad, too. She inquired if he had been serious about proposing, which he was. As he asked her if she had been serious about accepting the proposal, a soldier interrupted their talk to inform Megan that Sana wasn't doing well. Megan repositioned her chest tube while talking about her brother controlling her life to keep Sana calm. Megan then made sure Sana would be flown out on the next chopper.\n\nNot wanting to stay with Nathan at the medical center, she boarded the chopper with Sana. As the chopper was taking off, Teddy found out that Sana was actually the second shooter and that the man whom they had believed to be the second shooter had actually been wrestling the gun from her hands, not the other way around. Teddy tried to stop the chopper from taking off but she was too late. As a distracted and pensive Megan was staring out the window, Sana managed to grab her gun and hijack the helicopter, which disappeared while flying through unprotected airspace. Megan then disappeared for ten years. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\nHer disappearance caused a rift between Owen and Nathan, both of whom told people their own version of the story of her disappearance.\n\nOriginally, Nathan told Meredith that he had been working in a field unit with Megan on that day. According to him, they needed to transport a patient, but the chopper only had room for one of them. Megan wanted to go, as the patient was hers, so after failing to talk her out of it, Nathan agreed to let her on board. The chopper, however, never made it. Nathan also pointed out that after Megan's disappearance, he would've continued to look for her, but Owen wanted to give up searching and made him stop.\n\nUpon hearing Nathan's story from Meredith, Owen laughed joylessly, claiming that Nathan never said anything to Megan about not getting on board and, in fact, wasn't even anywhere near the chopper on that day, but with another woman. According to him, Megan had called him earlier that day, telling him that Nathan had been repeatedly cheating on her and that she was getting on the chopper to get away from him. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\nNathan later admitted to Maggie that, although he had told mostly the truth, he did cheat on her and they did fight. He said that he didn't tell Meredith about the fighting and cheating because he believed some things were meant for just him and Megan, and that he didn't owe anyone that explanation. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\nOwen later admitted to Amelia that when he learned that Nathan had cheated on Megan, he had told her to get on the helicopter. It was the last thing he ever said to her. ''(\"[[Trigger Happy]]\")''\n\n\nTen years after she went missing, she was found in the basement of a house in a rebel-held neighborhood, where she'd been left after a raid. After a hospital stay in Germany, she was sent to Seattle. ''(\"[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]]\")''\n[[File:xMeganHunt.png|thumb|px|Megan arrives at Madigan.]]\nSince a fire made the helipad at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] unavailable the day of her arrival, Owen and Amelia drove to Madigan Army Medical Center to meet the helicopter she was in. They were warned that she might communicate in extremes or possibly not at all. When Nathan learned that she was alive, he also left to go to Madigan. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\n\nOnce she was at the hospital, Megan revealed that despite being held captive, she was treated well. They only threw her in the basement to protect her from a bombing and wasn't actually kept in there. The only complaint she had was that she had a massive abdominal wound from a bombing that hadn't closed, which left her with a frozen abdomen. She was desperate to get back to her son, Farouk, a Syrian refugee she'd been caring for since he was four, so she wanted to get her abdomen repaired as quickly as possible so she could return to Iraq to be with him. Meredith suggested an extreme surgery that would close her abdomen much sooner than the more conservative approach and Megan jumped at the more radical option. After using saline implants to stretch her skin, Meredith attempted surgery to close her repaired abdomen, but found that she didn't have enough skin to close. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\nMeredith was forced to come up with an alternative plan to close her abdomen. After considering her options, she decided to look for a donor to give Megan an abdominal wall transplant. She challenged the sub-interns to find her a suitable donor. After reviewing several candidates they proposed, she finally found a good donor. Megan agreed to the transplant and it went well. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\nA week after surgery, she had sensation in her new skin and was healing well. ''(\"[[Go Big or Go Home]]\")''\n\n\nTo her dismay, she developed an infection in her abdomen which required IV antibiotics. When she learned that Farouk was in the hospital, she tried to leave so she could go back to him, but Meredith stopped her and convinced her to stay, reminding her that she couldn't be there for Farouk if she died. Unbeknownst to her, Farouk was only in the hospital as a cover Nathan was using to get him a medical visa to come to the US. She was happy to be reunited with Farouk. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nAfter being released from the hospital, Megan decided to move to Los Angeles with Farouk and Nathan, because when she was in Iraq, she consoled herself with remembering a childhood trip to the beach and the only part of the trip she couldn't fake was the ocean, which made her determined to visit the ocean every day once she was rescued. She sent Farouk and Nathan ahead to get the [[Megan and Nathan's House|house]] ready and then took a road trip to join them. Owen unexpectedly joined her on the trip, which gave them time to hash out their old issues. Once she arrived in Los Angeles, she walked out onto the beach and into the water. Nathan and Farouk quickly joined her and they played in the water together happily. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n\n[[Caleb Hicks]] was a patient of Megan's in San Diego. He had lost a leg, penis, and scrotum in an IED explosion and also had a frozen abdomen like she had. She convinced him to go for the abdominal wall transplant by showing him her own result. He was then brought to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to have that transplant as well as a penis and scrotum. After being briefly cancelled, the surgery was rescheduled and went forward as planned. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\n\nMegan and Farouk came to Seattle for Teddy and Owen's wedding. The wedding was initially supposed to take place in a park, but before the priest could finish the ceremony, a couple on a tandem bicycle crashed into him, seriously injuring both him and the couple. After the priest died, Megan stepped in and performed the ceremony at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nAfter the wedding, Megan stayed in Seattle to help cover Meredith's cases while she was in Minnesota. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nMegan became concerned when Farouk started getting winded more than normal and had swollen ankles. She took him to the hospital so Cormac could examine him and was upset to learn that he had constrictive pericarditis. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nMegan sent Farouk into surgery, but shortly afterward, a gas main explosion shook the hospital. Megan ran to the OR, where she learned Farouk was already under anesthesia for the blast. Despite this, she sat down and held his hand, saying when he was triggered by loud noises, she would hold his hands and hum cartoon theme songs, something she'd done since they were in Iraq. Winston and Cormac encouraged her to do so in the OR. The surgery went well, but his heart swelled, so they were unable to close immediately. They injected epinephrine and Cormac sat with Megan while they waited for the swelling to go down. Once it had, they closed and Megan went out to the scrub room and cried. Teddy and Owen met her in Farouk's room, where they said they were family and she didn't have to do it alone. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nFarouk was still in the hospital on Thanksgiving. They played Monopoly with Teddy and Cormac to pass the time. Later in the day, Farouk went into v-fib and eventually had to be put on ECMO while also being put on the transplant list for a new heart. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nWhen Cormac came to check on Farouk one day, he asked Megan how she was and suggested she go take a break or a nap. Megan told Cormac that if Farouk died, she would die with him. She had survived so much in her life and had no desire to survive Farouk's death. When a heart became available in Tacoma for Farouk, Teddy, Owen, and Cormac went to retrieve it. While they were gone, Winston took Farouk to the OR so he would be ready when the donor heart arrived. Evelyn came to the hospital to sit with Megan while she waited. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhile Farouk was in surgery, Cormac came to her and told her he needed to hear her plan to live before he told her some news that he had. She said he could watch her call her therapist, so he told her that Owen had been in a car accident on the way to the hospital with the heart had been seriously injured and Farouk's heart was bruised in transit. He then watched as she made the call as promised. Soon afterward, Megan was relieved when Winston and Maggie told her that Farouk's heart was beating strongly. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nMegan continued to stay in the hospital with Farouk as he started recovering. When Teddy came to Megan with concerns about Owen and Cormac's behavior following the crash, including Cormac's abrupt resignation from the hospital, Megan told Teddy that Owen always believes he's doing the right thing. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\nOnce Owen came home to recover, he and Farouk competed at completing their recoveries. To aid in his recovery, Megan converted his and Teddy's dining room into a home gym. As soon as Farouk was recovered enough, he and Megan returned home. Before she and Farouk left, Megan told Owen and Teddy to take the time to work out whatever issue there was between them. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nMegan and Nathan were in a romantic relationship, and Megan apparently loved him dearly. However, according to Owen, Nathan had been cheating on her, prompting her to get on the chopper along with which she disappeared. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Nathan have a confrontation over Megan.]]\n\nDuring their time together, she and Nathan talked about having kids. ''(\"[[Both Sides Now]]\")''\n\nAfter she was rescued, Nathan proposed to Megan, but she turned him down because she believed he was still in love with Meredith. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\nHowever, she later accepted the proposal and they moved to Los Angeles together with Farouk. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\nMegan said that she and Nathan visit a couple's therapist weekly. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\nOn Owen and Teddy's wedding day, Megan revealed that she and Nathan had split up.

When [[Penelope Blake|Penny]] wanted to run a head CT, he said they shouldn't because he believed the abdominal injuries were more pressing. When he became unstable in the ER, they rushed Derek into surgery.\n\nWhile they were on the way to the OR, Penny made one final play to get the CT, since he was stable. Paul again declined and they took Derek into surgery and started operating. When he became unstable, Paul finally remembered that he'd had a head laceration and had the anesthesiologist check his eyes, which revealed a blown right pupil. They paged the neurosurgeon, [[Dr. Cohn]], who said he'd be there in  minutes because he was at a dinner. Despite this, it took him an hour and a half to arrive.\n\nAfter the time had passed and they were able to declare Derek brain dead, Paul approached Meredith about what to do. She explained that she knew the process because she's a surgeon, too, and then screamed at him to give her the papers. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n\nPaul was the panel chair during Meredith's hearing, but didn't seem to recognize her. He questioned Andrew about his relationship with Meredith and listened as the other witnesses were questioned. When he talked to Alex about how Meredith nearly jeopardized Zola's adoptions. While he was talking, Meredith could no longer keep quiet and listed the names of the four spouses of patients she'd lost. She remembered all of them. She told Paul who she was. Paul asked for a recess and shortly afterward, he collapsed and started seizing. Meredith and the others immediately stepped in to treat him. When paramedics arrived, he was taken to the hospital, where a head CT revealed a hemorrhage in his brain. Unable to operate on him herself, Amelia asked Tom to step in and do the craniotomy. Tom agreed and operated. During the surgery, Tom repaired the bleed, but then he had a re-bleed and Tom was unable to save his life. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe worked alongside [[Penelope Blake]]. He seemed to have little to no respect for her, which Derek believed was because she's smarter, younger, and probably because she's a woman.\n\n\nPaul was a [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]] at [[Dillard Medical Center]].

They then each argued that the injuries related to their specialty should be treated first.\n\nThey eventually started work. Mark put vinegar on his skin to minimize the burning. While they were working, Bailey assured him that more than just this one piece defines him. Callie had to do a fasciotomy to relive the pressure in his leg. They then started to remove the larger pieces of cement to get him out. Bailey figured out that they were missing something, but she couldn't figure it out. She thought about it and remembered that they'd hydrated him, but hadn't given him a way to release the urine, so they needed to place a catheter before his bladder exploded.

Amelia didn't know she was pregnant, as she thought the symptoms were withdrawal symptoms. However, it became clear when she took a pregnancy test. ''(\"[[Andromeda]]\")''\n\nAt first, Amelia refused to have an ultrasound, but she later agreed to let Addison do it. While doing it, Addison revealed to Amelia the baby was a boy, but she suddenly turned the screen away because the baby turned out to be anencephalic (he had no brain). Amelia then fired Addison as her OB and denied herself and her baby prenatal care. However, when [[Jake Reilly|Jake]] brought up that prenatal care was important for both the baby and the mother, she hired him as her doctor.\n\nUpon dealing with a brain dead patient, Amelia decided to donate her baby's organs to save multiple other babies all over the country. ''(\"[[And Then There Was One]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Amelia went into labor, she first told Jake. She was then taken to [[St. Ambrose Hospital]]. A transplant team was composed because of Amelia's wish to donate the baby's organs, but Sam, the only cardiothoracic surgeon in the hospital who was allowed to harvest organs from babies, initially refused to do it. He refused because it was murder in his opinion, as the baby could not be legally declared brain dead because of a functioning brain stem. However, if they'd waited for the baby to die first, the organs wouldn't have been viable anymore, which was why the harvesting had to take place not long after birth. [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] first didn't want to see her baby, but once he was born, she wanted to see her son. She referred to him as the \"most beautiful baby in the world.\"\n\nThe lawyers of the hospital also didn't agree with Amelia's plan. However, seeing Amelia in the hospital room, Charlotte said they would do the surgery. A conversation with Addison and Charlotte's actions also encouraged Sam to take place in the transplant team. His organs were harvested and transported for use.

She sponsored him through AA.\n\nWhen she learned that Richard was seeing Ellis again, she warned him off it, saying that he was having an emotional affair with the person who drove him to drink in the first place.\n\n\nOlive had a TIPS procedure that failed.\n\n\nA month after her procedure, she came into the ER with upper GI bleeding. Her TIPS procedure had failed. She was on the transplant list, but her cirrhosis was so severe that she needed help to wait for one.\n\nRichard told her she needed a portacaval shunt, which had a % survival rate. He'd done nine before, with four surviving. She said it was perfect because she'd be five out of ten. She had the surgery and survived it. ''(\"[[Superstition]]\")''\n\n\nOlive collapsed at an AA meeting. She was resuscitated in the field before they noticed her DNR bracelet. They then took her to Grey Sloan, where she requested Richard, calling him her personal physician. She knew she had cardiomyopathy due to her liver failure and had accepted that she was going to die. Despite this, Richard brought in Maggie and Meredith to find a way to save her. They examined her, but had to tell Richard there weren't any good options and he finally accepted that she was going to die. He brought Amelia with him into her room so they could have a meeting together. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\n\nShe remained in the hospital until her death.

He was [[Chief of Staff|Chief Medical Officer]] of the Foundation before being replaced by [[Richard Webber]]. He was [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], where he trained [[Amelia Shepherd]] in the field. In Seattle, he developed a relationship with [[Teddy Altman]] until she chose Owen after having his baby, though the two later developed a short-lived affair.\n\n\n\nAt some point in his life, Tom got married to Dana and had a son named David with her. When David was  years old, he died when he got hit in the head with a baseball bat.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref> David's death happened two weeks before Halloween, which was David's favorite holiday and Tom and David's thing. They had prepared a Luke Skywalker\uacostume to go trick-or-treating that year. David never got a chance to wear it and the costume hung on the his bedroom door for months as Tom couldn't bring himself to take it down. His son's death left him hating Halloween.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nAfter David's death, Tom went numb and sleep-walked through years of his life. Eventually, he crossed paths with [[Catherine Fox]] and she finally woke him up again and reminded him what it was like to be alive. They performed sacral nerve implantations so often that they came up with a routine of singing \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\". Over time, they ended up having sex though they never were romantically involved beyond that.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nTom was Amelia's mentor at Johns Hopkins Hospital.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nHe met [[Derek Shepherd]] on the conference circuit. Derek was not a fan of Tom's as he told him it was appropriate that his name had \"ass\" smack in the middle of it.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter learning she had a large brain tumor, Amelia called Tom, her former mentor, to come to Seattle to operate on her. After he arrived, he agreed to operate and also made it clear that Amelia wouldn't be allowed to treat patients until he cleared her, as the tumor was affecting her judgment.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref> Amelia's surgery went smoothly and a few days afterward, Koracick cleared Amelia to go home.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Amelia attempted surgery on her first day back, she asked Tom to scrub in, unsure she could handle it herself. He scrubbed in, but she was able to remove the tumor easily without his help. After the surgery, he admitted he'd hoped she'd fail because that would mean she's not better than him anymore. After their shared success, they had sex in an on-call room.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia called Koracick back to Seattle again to help with researching a technique to remove Kimmie's tumor. After seeing Kimmie and her scans, Koracick believed it was pointless to try to perfect it within such a deadline and wanted to quit, but during a fight with Amelia over the issue, he had an epiphany and discussed a possible solution with Amelia. They later tested it and while it didn't work perfectly, it had more success than their prior attempts, giving them hope.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nTom came to the game night Maggie organized so Amelia and Meredith could meet [[Clive Johnson|Clive]]. He played as April's partner and had a good time. When the night abruptly ended, Tom ended up driving an intoxicated April home.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nAfter waking up from their one-night stand, Tom stuck around at her place and tried to figure out why she was so different from the woman Amelia had chosen for her Power of Attorney during her surgery. He eventually figured out that it was a crisis of faith and talked to her about his own faith, which was tested when his son died in a freak accident involving a baseball bat to the head at age ten. His marriage fell apart after the death of their son and his priest recommended talking to God. Since he didn't want to talk to God, he decided to go to Mass and speak to his son instead, something he told April he still does.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nAfter [[Noah Brosniak]] was diagnosed with an HH tumor, Tom and Amelia decided to use the treatment they were developing for Kimmie to help him. They had to control the lasers very carefully to make sure they were destroying the tumor but not his brain. The procedure was successful and Noah lived, but the difficulty made them realize it would take more time than Kimmie had left to fine-tune it to work for her type of tumor. Therefore, they decided to develop a treatment plan that would allow Kimmie to live until summer when Koracick planned to take vacation time and fly Peg and Kimmie to New York to see as many Broadway shows as possible before she died. Alex became angry when he learned of this plan and shoved Tom up against a cabinet before backing off.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs Tom and Amelia continued their research into using the laser treatments to remove tumors, he spent time in Seattle more frequently. After Meredith turned down his flirtations, Tom caught a first glimpse of Teddy when he witnessed an awkward interaction between her, Amelia, and Owen on the elevator. While working on their research, Amelia began listing reasons for her to be appointed interim Chief over Teddy. Tom picked up on the jealousy shining through in her comments on Teddy's history with Owen and pointed out Amelia didn't need to pretend like she was a victim in her marriage to Owen. She had been an ass to Owen and the sex she had with Tom the day after they separated screamed that she was glad to be rid of Owen. With their research failing spectacularly, Tom took the time to give Amelia some advice. He told her to knock the other player, Teddy, out of the game if she wanted Owen back. Amelia refused to take personal life advice from him. Tom then shared his biggest regret in life was not fighting for his wife when she decided to walk out of their marriage into the bed of another man.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nAs Amelia was pulled into surgeries often, Tom often worked on the project by himself out of boredom. When Link mistook Tom for the new interim Chief, Tom helped him find Alex. Tom then witnessed how Alex swiftly approved Link's request for a new -D printer to make prosthetics without asking for any details. Tom sarcastically commented Alex was very chiefly while he previously thought Bailey had only picked Alex to make herself look better. Over their research, Tom proposed more sex to Amelia, who turned him down as she had turned a new page with Owen. Tom went to the ER to find Alex to get him to approve a requisition before he would be fired. He then took over when [[Vikram Roy|Vik's]] patient with a nosebleed deteriorated quickly due to Vik's incompetence. Tom rushed the patient to the IR suite to embolize the artery and called in Alex for help, but they failed to get vascular access in time and the patient died on the table. Alex dismissed Roy but Tom wanted him to call time of death first. Roy stated this mistake couldn't be put on him as he was an intern and left. Tom then told Alex he was failing at his job.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom and Meredith were both summoned to Los Angeles for a VIP patient. They speculated that it was someone famous. Before their private plane took off, Meredith told him about how she had dabbled in neurosurgery and how that had come to an end. Tom noticed how uncomfortable Meredith was on the plane and she requested he keep talking to keep her distracted. Catherine met the two of them at the new Catherine Fox Medical Center. On their way to the radiology suite, Catherine told them the patient was a -year-old female with crescendo neck and back pain. She showed them the scans and they were in awe of a tumor that had invaded the vascular and nerve domains, which they agreed could not be removed easily. Catherine then revealed that she was the patient. Tom apologized for his bluntness. The tumor required a biopsy and Catherine stated she would not inform Richard or Jackson until they got those results back. She then took them to the IR suite right away. As he performed the biopsy, Tom ordered a worried Meredith not to backseat drive the procedure. Tom told her that she was a Big Gun, like him, spending her days with worst-case scenarios. He told her Big Guns don't worry until there is something to worry about.\n\nAs Catherine started to wake up after the procedure, Tom started singing \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\" to her. He informed her they were still waiting on the results. Meredith wanted to call Richard but Catherine wanted to get a drink first. As they entered the bar and ordered tequila, Catherine asked the two of them to talk her through the next steps if the tumor turned out to be malignant. They tried to dance around the subject but Catherine pointed out that nothing they could say could be worse than what she had been imagining since finding out about the tumor. Tom and Meredith then said there were two options, osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma, with a chondrosarcoma being likely to render her quadriplegic. Tom excused himself to the restroom and returned with the news that the results were in. Catherine requested one last drink before heading back to the hospital. After finding out, Tom and Meredith attended the hospital's ribbon cutting. When Tom commented on Catherine's looks, Meredith asked what was going on between them. He then shared how Catherine had saved him after his son's death. He confided that he was now worried about his friend, who had a grade  chondrosarcoma that he had no idea how to remove without paralyzing her. Catherine came over and told Tom to find away because after surviving her parents' deaths and raising her siblings and building this legacy for herself, she might just survive this tumor, too. Catherine went to call Richard, who didn't answer his phone as he had been arrested.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref> Richard called her back after Meredith bailed him out, but Tom answered her phone. Richard hung up, believing that Catherine was having an affair with him.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nTom returned to Seattle after the windstorm and recruited Amelia's help to figure out a surgical plane for Catherine's tumor. Their plans were disrupted when Owen came to explain to Amelia that he and Teddy had just been fighting as friends, while Amelia stated fighting like that is what couples do. Tom then requested Owen leave so they could focus. Once he was gone, Tom once again expressed interest in Teddy. After a failed VR practice run of multiple approaches, Amelia was paged away for a consult. When she returned, they started arguing over the impossibility of the situation, which attracted Jo to their study room. She shared that there was a brand new way of -D tumor visualisation called ORBEYE. As Jo dug into the case, Tom marvelled over her beauty and miraculous solution. At the end of the day, Tom met Teddy in the attendings' lounge and sat down to eat his fries. He estimated she was about  weeks along, which was spot on. They introduced themselves to one another and Tom fed her fries as she was rubbing her feet.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nWith better visualisation available, Tom and Amelia came up with a plan to remove the tumor. As the day of the surgery drew nearer, they spend every waking moment studying the tumor and preparing. On the morning of the surgery, Teddy came across Tom playing Operations on a bench outside. Teddy was confident that he and Amelia were ready. Tom and Amelia came to Catherine to explain to her and her family their approach. Amelia interfered when Tom's smug demeanor rubbed Jackson the wrong way. On their way to the OR, Amelia and Tom went over the plan again. Tom had to admit he was nervous when even his arrogance was off. He admitted was thinking about how he couldn't lose another person dear to him and how countless men would be left with sexless lives if this surgery were to leave Catherine unable to operate. They then did the superhero pose and entered the OR to meet Catherine. She reminded them to get clear margins and preserve her motor function. Tom and Amelia gave her a private moment with her husband. Jackson then put on \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" and the staff all danced to the song together.\n\nThe first part of the surgery went well, with Tom loudly singing along to the music. The new microscope gave them perfect visualisation. When they came to the part of removing the tumor en bloc, Amelia found that she couldn't get it free. Tom then told her to do a suck and pluck but they found the tumor was too dense. Tom had the music killed and said they needed to go in from the front. Amelia was in disbelief that Tom wanted to flip Catherine with her spine open but she realized they had no other choice. The flip went well but Tom froze as he was now directly facing Catherine's face. Amelia then feigned a problem so they had to switch places, which brought him back. They freed the tumor from the brachial plexus but the electrophysiologist warned them that the signal in one of her arms was lost. Since removing the tumor en bloc was no longer an option, Richard told them to remove the tumor piecemeal and use his PathPen to see if they got it all. They chose to follow that approach. After hours of doing so with still tumor left behind, they were warned that continuing would impair the motor function in her arms. They decided to stop operating and leave some of the tumor behind. Catherine woke up after the surgery with her motor and sensory functions intact. Tom and Amelia then shared that they had to leave some of the tumor behind. Tom and Amelia apologized for that but Catherine was glad to still be alive with no impairment. Tom said she would have to have scans every three months to track the tumor's growth, but Catherine added she could just live her life in between those scans. She thanked her surgeons for giving her her life back. She planned on throwing a party to celebrate this miracle. Afterward, Tom ran into Teddy in the lobby. She congratulated him and noticed that he wasn't in a celebratory mood for not having succeeded at removing the entire tumor. Teddy stressed that he did save her life and her career and invited him to Joe's to buy him a drink. He asked for a rain check because he wanted to smell good when she would spend money on him. She agreed to that and he walked away with a smile.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom was called in to consult on the case of [[Lucille Reid]], who had an aneurysm in her brain. He and Teddy operated together to fix her. They also observed that she had two men doting over her: her husband, [[Marvin]], and her best friend, [[Julian]]. After working on the case, Tom wondered about the analogous situation happening with her and Owen. That night, she went to his hotel room to show him that she was only ever meant to be friends with Owen.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom attended Catherine's party, with Teddy as his guest. At the party, he and Owen butted heads over his relationship with Teddy, which included a planned pre-baby vacation to Palm Springs. Owen confronted him about it, but he was unconcerned until Owen said that he's not a father. When he heard that, Tom punched Owen. Teddy corrected Owen that Tom is a father and stopped Owen from punching Tom back. Tom then iced his hand as the party continued until a plastic pan accidentally placed in the oven forced an evacuation of the building.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Owen left a birthing class Teddy had invited Tom to be with Teddy after she experienced some troubling symptoms, Tom realized Owen was trying to shut him out of the experience. He warned Owen that he would fight for Teddy to have the person who loves her and only her.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Teddy decided she wanted to buy a house before the baby was born, Tom helped her look, as he claimed superpowers relating to houses.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter [[Kari Donnelly]] was paralyzed in an accident, Link found a study that involved directly injecting stem cells into the spines of quadriplegic patients in the hopes of regaining the use of their arms. He suggested this treatment for Kari, who agreed to try it. In surgery, Tom injected the stem cells.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nThirteen days after her infusion, Kari still had no mobility in her upper limbs. She had other health issues associated with her paralysis, which weakened her.\n\n\nWith only three weeks left until she was due, Teddy had not purchased a house for them to live in. Tom took up the mantle and found Teddy a house that fulfilled all the requirements she'd set out. He then surprised her with a set of keys, which he admitted were just a prop because he hadn't been able to go pick up the actual house keys.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nTom later purchased a crib for Teddy's baby and said he'd put it together for her.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy went into labor, Tom remained unaware and continued to assemble the baby furniture at her new house. While working, he Skyped in to see [[Kari Donnelly]] move her fingers.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe tried calling Teddy, but she didn't answer. He then figured she had given birth and went to the hospital. He found her in a room with her newborn daughter and a crying [[Leo Hunt]]. He admired the baby for a moment and took Leo off her hands. He knew Teddy had gotten back together with Owen after he rode in on a white horse and made all the right promises. Teddy took all the blame for her decision and told Tom he was wonderful. Tom knew that and stated it wouldn't last and that she'd come to regret her decision. He told her he would be there for her when it ended because he loved her, and in the meantime, they would remain friends. He then brought Leo back to daycare so she could rest. A week later, Tom had a meeting with Catherine and accepted her offer to become Chief Medical Officer of her Foundation, meaning he would get to oversee all Chiefs of Surgery of her Foundation's medical centers.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nTom arranged to permanently move to [[Seattle]] and he asked his prot\ueg\ue resident [[Blake Simms]] to move with him. Blake refused as he couldn't leave his grandmother behind. However, Tom wanted him so badly that he paid for Blake's grandmother to move to Seattle with them.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nOn his first day at the job, Tom enjoyed taunting Owen before revealing his promotion to him to put him in an awkward position. He made Owen let him step off the elevator first. While rounding the hospital, he found out Bailey had set up a skills lab for the residents and dismissed teaching, ignoring Jackson's remark that Grey Sloan was a teaching hospital. In the ER, he found that Owen and Maggie were working excessively to resuscitate [[Reid Kim]]. He ordered them to stop but Owen ignored him. Before he could shock Reid's heart again, the rhythm returned suddenly. Owen punted to put the already-charged paddles aside but accidentally shocked Tom in the crotch. Tom fell the floor while squirming in pain. His prot\ueg\ue resident [[Blake Simms]] helped him to a wheelchair and got him [[Catherine Fox]] to treat him. Owen briefly apologized while rushing the patient to the OR but he dropped by Tom's room for a proper apology afterwards. However, in the meanwhile, Tom had obtained an emergency restraining order against him for acute emotional and physical distress. Owen was baffled. Tom directed him to his lawyer for any questions and made him leave.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref> Tom had fun in abusing the restraining order to exert power over Owen by making him leave his trauma room while he examined Owen's patient. Later, he made Owen leave the ER altogether.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith released an expos\ue that trashed Grey Sloan's reputation, Tom quickly came up with a plan to get the hospital free positive publicity. He called [[Dana Martin|Dana]] and [[Peter Martin]] to inform them that [[Jackson Avery]] would operate on [[Clervie Martin|their daughter's]] deformed skull pro bono if they allowed them to film the surgery and use it for promotion. The parents consented since the surgery would otherwise require them to take out a second mortgage. Tom hired a camera crew to document Jackson's miraculous work. Jackson hated the set-up, which only increased as Tom was more concerned with getting proper testimonies as publicity material than putting the parents' concerns at ease. After Tom asked the father to repeat his testimony while filmed from another angle with less backlight, Jackson cut in and told him that the surgery was hard enough on the parents already. Tom reminded him that he was the boss and wondered if he should get Catherine to explain it to him again. However, Jackson went behind his back to have the surgery take place without being documented and had him replaced by Amelia. Tom found out and went to confront him in the OR, where Jackson told him he would call security if the camera crew came near the OR. Tom wanted to pull rank again but Jackson pointed out that he was Foundation, too, owning more shares of the hospital than anyone else, and that his cosmetic procedures provided quite an income for the hospital, so Tom better leave him alone. Tom tried to reason that fires like the one Meredith had started spread rapidly and that it would burn down more than this hospital alone but Jackson didn't budge. Tom realized that they needed good doctors to stay and went to inform Owen that he had gotten rid of the restraining order, but he came too late, as Owen had taken a job at Pac-North. Tom thought he would come to regret that and invited him to call him when that happened. He also reminded Teddy she could still call him if she regretted her choice of picking Owen over him.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nTom put Andrew on his service to get him to make Meredith make things right with the hospital. Meredith herself then turned up with a sick Zola. They did some scans and found that her shunt needed to be revised. Tom flawlessly performed the surgery.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Tom worked on a patient with Teddy and Bailey. While he dismissed Halloween every chance he got, Teddy was stressing out over Owen's apparent hint for her to make costumes for their children. She said they skipped so many steps from friends to a family of four that she didn't feel prepared for the situation, leaving her to feel like she had no idea what she was doing. Tom then said he didn't understand her either and told her not to let Owen make her feel inept as a mother for not making costumes like his mother had done. He finished up his part of the surgery and went back to the ER to save more Halloween casualties. The patient made it through the surgery. Afterwards, Bailey confronted Tom with his incessant complaining about the holiday and he told her that his son's death ruined Halloween for him as it used to be their thing. Hearing the story made a hormonal Bailey sob in front of him, which she had been trying to avoid, and he comforted her.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nTom stayed at the hospital while most of the attendings took the day off to support Meredith on the day of her hearing before the medical commission. He was surprised to find Amelia, Link, and Teddy back soon and learned that they had diagnosed [[Paul Castello]], the man who had killed Derek, with a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. Tom performed a craniotomy and managed to evacuate the hematoma against all odds. However, a sudden rebleed happened and Tom was unable to save Paul.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Tom learned that Teddy was scrubbing in with Maggie on a cardiothoracic surgery after months, he came into the gallery to observe her and complimented her technique. After the patient's heart wouldn't restart, Maggie quit because she had lost faith in her abilities. Tom tried to convince her otherwise but she had made up her mind. Tom then asked Teddy to become his Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery again. She got mad thinking he fired Maggie to give Teddy what she wanted. She told him that she loved Owen and had moved on from Tom. She said he would make some woman or several women very happy but she asked him to stop barking up this particular tree. Tom then said Maggie actually quit and he wanted her to replace her. Tom then pointed out that Owen had a baby with her and hadn't even proposed yet while Tom was ready to marry her today, which made him wonder if she really wanted to close the door on him.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nTom sprung into action when his prot\ueg\ue [[Blake Simms]] sustained a mid-facial fracture when a car crashed into Joe's bar. He insisted on checking the scans for brain bleeds himself and found none. He then checked if Jackson was good to operate after the long night he'd had. Jackson said he didn't need a babysitter and went ahead with the surgery. Tom requested an update on every step. Jackson couldn't help but make a snide remark about using this case to exploit Blake's vulnerability for free publicity. They neglected to provide him with updates so Tom came in furious when they were wrapping up the surgery. Owen then stopped Jackson as he saw a sign of a CSF leak. Tom scrubbed in and found and patched up the leak. Tom called Blake's grandmother and while Jackson showed her to her grandson, Tom thanked Owen for catching the CSF leak and they shook hands. At the end of the day, Tom watched in disdain as Teddy and Owen announced their engagement to the hospital staff.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nBailey took some unexpected personal time off while the injured residents were still out, increasing Tom's workload. On her first day back, he commented on her unexpected leave multiple times. At the end of the day, she told it wasn't just a vacation but instead time to grieve her miscarriage. He sympathized with her, having been through two miscarriages with Dana before they had David. He shared that it is not as easy to get over as people make it seem, as a miscarriage takes away a piece of your heart that can never be replaced. That is why he developed a habit of lighting a candle on the babies' would-be birthdays. Bailey took his advice and found comfort lighting a candle in the chapel.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie met with Tom to ask her for her job back but he was hesitant as he had Teddy already to replace her.<ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref> As Catherine purchased and subsequently closed down Pac-North, she had Tom interview the staff to see who could be transferred to Grey Sloan. Bailey wanted to make some recommendations but Tom refused to hear her out. Tom went to the waiting room and started with Richard. Tom immediately told him that Catherine had already secured his position at Grey Sloan, which angered Richard and made him refuse. He also met with Maggie despite Catherine already having re-hired her, too, just to make sure it wouldn't seem like he was playing favorites. However, he stressed that it was still Teddy's department. Owen grew impatient when Tom started interviewing residents after meeting all the other attendings. When Owen suggested he was playing a game, Tom promised him he would be out in time for his wedding and continued to interview the residents. When he had seen everyone but Owen, Tom took his time consulting with Catherine on the phone. At the end of the day, he found Bailey, Jackson, Richard, Meredith, and Owen waiting for him in the conference room. They told him they were prepared to quit unless he agreed to all of their terms, which he could present to Catherine as his own ideas to save face and ensure that Catherine wouldn't fire him for causing her top doctors to quit. He was forced agree to re-hire Owen and to have the Cardio and Peds departments led by Co-heads.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nAs a blizzard hit Seattle, Teddy learned that Amelia was on leave and asked Tom about it, but he didn't know why, only that it was not about her baby. Later, Tom brought Teddy hot cocoa as she was enjoying the snow out in the ambulance bay. She told him that she was trying to quiet her mind as she had been having this fear for months that Owen was the father of Amelia's baby. She admitted she was afraid that Owen would always be in love with Amelia. Tom assured Teddy that Owen was very much in love with her, even though he would like for it to be different. Teddy told him he was a good man. He opened up and said people didn't seem to like him despite his attempts to get in with people. Teddy told him she didn't dislike him at all. Tom then initiated a snowball fight. That night, Teddy came by his hotel room. As soon as he opened the door, she started kissing him. He let her in and closed the door.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOn his way to VIP patient [[Griffin Ford]], a multimillionaire who was behind a rocket explosion over the city causing severe injuries, Tom overheard Owen and Teddy discussing wedding venues. Tom was surprisingly nice to Owen. Teddy was afraid it would make Owen suspicious. Tom wanted to keep seeing her and discuss what it meant but Teddy said it meant nothing and that she had acted impulsively because she was afraid that Owen could be the father to Amelia's baby. Tom then went to see Griffin, who talked about the bad press the explosion had left him with. He pleaded with Tom to do a thorough examination in order to find a medical reason that could have caused him to make the mistake that led to the crash. Tom recruited Meredith, who was annoyed that Tom had cleared an entire floor for Griffin, causing troubles with admissions in the hospital. She started her exam but left it to Jackson so she could care for her own patient. Jackson couldn't find anything. Griffin then offered Tom a bribe, asking for a fake diagnosis in exchange for a large sum of money that would allow him to do good in the world. Tom consulted with Meredith about what she would do with Griffin's money and how she decided which rules to break. She gave him some ideas and said she just followed her gut in order to improve the world. Tom then decided to accept Griffin's bribe and \"diagnosed\" him with an aneurysm that could have influenced his judgment. At the end of the day, Teddy came to see Tom in his office and apologized to him, saying he deserved better than what she had done. She explained Tom made her feel good and like she was in control. She didn't want to hurt him because he was such a good guy. They then kissed again.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith organized a pro bono surgery day with  surgeries scheduled. Tom increased the pressure by only allowing OR access until  PM. During the day, Teddy pulled him into a supply closet and told him that Owen was not the father to Amelia's baby. However, that didn't change the way that Teddy felt about Tom. She was paged away and Tom went to check on the pro bono surgeries. He found several patients and their loved ones yelling at Meredith for increased waiting times. Tom then agreed to give her more time and pay for the overtime as well. He confessed Griffin Ford gave him some money and Meredith immediately figured out what he had done. He reminded her that she told him to follow his gut to fix the world. Afterward, Tom met up with Teddy in the OR gallery and told her that while he had slept with a lot of women, he drew the line at married women because he had been the guy whose wife had slept with another man. He wanted to make it easy for Teddy so he told her to go home to Owen and spend time with him.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nTom was part of the team of physicians trying to find out what was happening to Richard. Teddy caught up with him at work and he casually suggested she not marry Owen. He then suddenly froze as they were approached by [[Dana Hamilton]] and her son, [[Guthrie Hamilton]], who bore an uncanny resemblance to Tom and Dana's son David. Dana explained that Guthrie had a brain tumor with a spinal met and she didn't know who else to go to. Tom had Guthrie admitted and ordered new scans. Noticing how it made Tom upset, Teddy paged Amelia and informed her about the situation so she could take the case. As Amelia went to introduce herself, Tom used his busy schedule as an excuse. Owen paged Tom for a consult on [[Vera Kitano]], who kept on singing after waking up from her surgery. Tom diagnosed musicophilia and went to check out her scans. Teddy found him in the scan room and an emotional Tom told her that he always thought he could have saved David if he had gotten him to the hospital in time, but now it was like David was there and he couldn't even stand to be in the same room as him, meaning that thought he had been holding onto was a lie. Shortly after beginning the operation, Amelia started to experience contractions. She had Tom paged to take over. He desperately asked her to work through it but she was confident he could do it. Teddy calmed him from the gallery, making him focused enough to diagnose an air embolism. They got it out and Tom finished the surgery successfully. He delivered the happy news to Dana, who apologized for having put him through this. Teddy came by his office to comfort him and apologized for the pain she had caused him. He told her she had taken away more pain than she had caused him. They briefly held hands until she pulled away and left.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nTom and Amelia agreed that Richard was suffering from Alzheimer's, which convinced Catherine to take him home. Later, Owen came to yell at Tom for ignoring his request for time off for the wedding. Tom said he had ignored the e-mail because he didn't think it was urgent based on the subject line, though Owen informed him that they had moved up the wedding to tonight. Tom was surprised but approved Owen's time off. Once he left, Tom called out Teddy for not warning him. He feigned happiness for her. When new symptoms arose, Amelia and Tom performed an EMG, which proved peripheral nerve damage, thus disqualifying the Alzheimer's diagnosis. Tom ran into Teddy again and he brought up the wedding, which he thought she was rushing to convince herself that she could live without Tom. Teddy insisted the wedding would happen, which Tom doubted. Tom then went to see Catherine, who told him she might be asking him to take on a bigger role in the Foundation as she wanted to devote more time to Richard as she was determined not to give up on him a second time. This inspired Tom to page Teddy to his office. He told her not to throw her life away and reminded her that she loved him, too. He insisted he wouldn't give up on her and said he would be waiting for her in his car at  PM, ready to take her wherever she wanted to go. As she started kissing him again, she said she couldn't do that but admitted she loved Tom, too. They proceeded to have sex, during which Teddy told Tom that this was goodbye as she was still going to marry Owen. Unbeknownst to them, they were recorded on a voice mail that Teddy was accidentally leaving Owen.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nThe affair effectively ended while word about the butt dial accident spread around the hospital.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle, Bailey sprung into action to prepare the hospital for the incoming patients while Tom maintained his casual, laid-back attitude. He nonchalantly walked around the hospital with a nine-iron golf club to keep people at a distance when necessary and refused to keep Bailey informed on the order of PPE he had placed. Eventually, the delivery arrived. Tom was joined by a handful of excited doctors, amongst them Teddy, at the loading dock to unpack and distribute the box. However, they soon found that all of the boxes contained booties while there were no masks or other protective gear. Frustated by his mistake, Tom started hitting the boxes with his golf club and broke down on the spot.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nTom heard that Richard made up a system using a UV light cleaning robot to clean masks and other PPE. Afraid of facing Catherine's wrath over his mistake, he tried to convince Richard to let him take the credit for Richard's idea, which Richard refused. He hid from her throughout the day but she paged him and Richard to the conference room at the end of the day. She told Tom that the crisis had proved bigger than him and she would accept his resignation at Chief of Chiefs, in return offering him a position as neurosurgery attending. His ego bruised, Tom claimed he could find a job anywhere he wanted, though Catherine pointed out that word of his sexual escapades had gotten around. He then accepted her proposition.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nRichard replaced him as Chief Medical Officer. Tom joined Owen and Jackson in the lounge as they were watching his speech announcing mandatory COVID tests for all hospital staff. He joked Richard was doing better than his last on screen performance, to which Owen reacted by throwing him out of the room. Richard helped Owen set up drive-through testing, which Tom had been putting off for weeks. Richard tasked Tom with introducing the new interns to the hospital's workings during the pandemic, but he only handed out assignments and told them to find someone else for questions. Due to his lacking guidance, [[James Chee]] failed to finish progress notes in time so Tom had to help him out. Later, while waiting in line for his COVID test, Tom overheard Owen instructing [[Mabel Tseng]] to show [[Sara Ortiz]] how to properly put on her PPE, which Owen said \"someone else\" should have shown her earlier. Tom took the hint. After clashing over a patient discharge with [[Alma Ortiz]], who told him half of her class had quit, Tom went to Richard's office. Citing the disasters with the interns quitting or failing at their jobs, he told Richard he wasn't a natural teacher like him. As he prepared to go home, Teddy joined him in the lounge and asked him to let her buy him coffee to apologize for the lack of contact between them these last few months. He asked her to leave him alone so he could get over her, because she had broken him and he had had enough hurt for a lifetime. To make matters worse, Owen came in to inform Tom that his COVID test had come back positive, meaning he had to go straight home and quarantine for  days.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nFrom home and still asymptomatic, Tom virtually attended an attendings' meeting. As he demanded a new test, Jackson flipped over the tablet to shut him out. Taryn delivered the test to his house. Not allowing residents in his home, he had her wait outside while he did the test on himself. Through the window, she noticed he had created an algorithm predicting the global spread of COVID- by adapting the algorithm for a zombie apocalypse game. The test came back positive. He demanded another one but his request was denied. His mood had taken a turn for the worst since his simulation had shown they would all die within a year. In the evening, Teddy showed up with soup to cheer him up, but he ignored her as he sat on the floor sweating and shaking, finally symptomatic and forced to face the reality of his diagnosis.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Tom is admitted to Grey Sloan.]]\nAs his symptoms rapidly worsened, he was taken to the hospital, where he seized upon arrival. He was in a postictal confused state as Teddy started the work-up in the ER. Amelia consulted on the case, coming out of her maternity leave. The exam showed no neurological deficits and she guessed the confusion had to be attributed to hypoxemia or possible early sepsis. She later did another EEG to exclude another seizure while his numbers remained stable. Teddy remained in the room afterward and said she hoped he had been too sick to answer the door, because that meant that there was hope for them, that their relationship or friendship could be salvaged despite the hurt she had caused him. She said they couldn't go through it alone and if he wanted her gone, he had to wake up and tell her to leave. He then opened his eyes and told her he had in fact ignored her. Glad to see him awake again, she jokingly told him she hated him. He stated they both knew that wasn't true and then asked for a sponge bath.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nHis condition improved though he suffered mentally from having people die around him. The confrontation with his mortality had made him nicer to the point where he talked to Maggie without using diminishing nicknames. He told her he had put his hopes on beating the virus himself on Meredith pulling through, so he was delighted to hear that Meredith was awake, too. He got some rest but woke up to Maggie failing to resuscitate his roommate. Tom got emotional and asked for the man's full name so he could properly pray for his family, whom he had heard during the numerous video calls. To cheer him up, Maggie informed him that Meredith was still stable. Tom then bribed a nurse to wheel him to Meredith's room. Inside, he told her he wanted to see that it was possible to beat this thing. As he said he wanted to be in a room where no one was dying, he broke down. She reached out and held his hand. As they had a friendly conversation, another patient down the hall died. Tom opened up and told Meredith that all he had in life was work and a long list of women he had slept with. She told him she had more. As they talked about kids, a nurse discovered Tom in the room and took him back to his own room while judging him for breaking protocol.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after, a somber Teddy came to inform him that Meredith's health had declined and they intubated her. She came to tell him in person because she wanted to be with someone who didn't hate her. Tom said he didn't hate her but he wanted her to hear from her sometime soon that she never loved him. She went back to work without doing so, but returned after operating on [[Andrew DeLuca]]. She commented that Tom's oxygen saturation had gone up, a good sign. She then told she did love him. She tried not to because she also loved Owen. She thought she could love them both but ended up tearing everything down to the ground. Tom pointed out that empirical evidence showed that she did not love them both, even though she may have convinced herself otherwise. He said he was still there while Owen did not want her anymore. If she actually loved him, they would be together and she wouldn't be so miserable. He needed for her to admit that so he could get up off the ground where she dropped him, if he were to survive COVID-. She then tearfully admitted she never loved him. He thanked her for giving him what he needed.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\nWith his health spectacularly improving, he attended Andrew's memorial service and was  discharged not long after.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref> He returned to work soon and hovered around the COVID ICU to keep an eye on Meredith. He heard about the ventilator shortage in the hospital and warned Owen, who had taken over Meredith's from Teddy, not to take her off the ventilator too soon or else she might not have one available if her sats were to decline again. Owen made it clear he was aware of that. Tom later overheard how the ventilator shortage forced the hospital to close its doors for trauma. Owen found Tom hovering outside Meredith's room and told him they would soon take her off the vent as she was consistently breathing over it. Tom said he would hate it if someone like him got to survive and someone like Meredith wouldn't make it. All too familiar with survivor's guilt from Iraq, Owen softened up and said that that feeling he was something he wouldn't wish on anyone, not even Tom.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\nHis first case back was [[Karissa Skolaski]], who had been in a car accident and had asked the first responder to save her first rather than her husband. Tom took her for a head CT, which showed no lesions that her selfish outburst could be blamed on. He had her admitted overnight for observation.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith failed to wake up with no plausible cause, Teddy took her for a head CT. Tom showed up in the CT boot as they waited for the results. A worried Teddy rambled on about the serious long-term effects. She then remembered that was a reality Tom was facing and apologized for her inconsiderately bringing it up. He brushed it off and said she was merely stating facts. Tom consulted on [[Felix Pelgado]], a patient of Link's that Amelia had brought in. Amelia took the case and as she operated on the meningioma, Tom and Link watched her from the gallery. Tom said he enjoyed watching Amelia's elegance and focus. Link brought up Meredith. Tom stated he had decided to avoid the entire COVID wing. They both wanted to scream at God for the miserable reality they had to live through.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom puts up a tough exterior at work and he is not shy from praising his own skills, both of which contribute to other people generally disliking him. However, Tom is funny and actually an emotional person as confirmed by [[Lorraine Simms]]. As such, he knows when to let go of his tough facade and show his true colors to people who are in need of comfort, like when he helped [[April Kepner]] acknowledge her crisis of faith or when [[Miranda Bailey]] needed some comfort after suffering a miscarriage. The loss of his son David rendered him with a notable soft spot for children as evidenced by his excellent bedside manner with [[Kimmie Park]] and the lengths he went to to make her final weeks perfect for her.\n\n\n\n[[Dana Hamilton]]\nHe was previously married to Dana. They had two miscarriages before their son David was born. Unfortunately, David died at the age of  due to a baseball accident. Tom and Dana's marriage fell apart and they divorced after their son David\uadied.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\uaTom mentioned to Teddy once that he knew what it was like to be cheated on, making it likely that Dana cheated on him as their marriage unraveled.\n\n [[Amelia Shepherd]] \nAfter Amelia's first surgery when she had recovered from her tumor, she had sex with him, where he also admitted she was a better surgeon than him.\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nHe had sex with April after they met at Maggie's game night. The morning after, he helped her with her crisis of faith and shared how he dealt with his son's death.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nicole Herman]]\nHe and Nicole had sex after she became blind.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nAfter learning that Teddy was pregnant with Owen's baby, but they weren't a couple, Tom expressed interest. When he later found Teddy in a lounge massaging her feet, he offered her some of his fries and fed them to her because her hands were covered in feet.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he operated on Catherine, Teddy offered to celebrate with a drink, but he took a rain check, saying he needed a shower.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Tom and Teddy at Catherine's party.]]At Jo and Alex's New Year's Eve party, Tom and Teddy shared a kiss at midnight. Later, he saw her lying down because her feet were hurting and said she should go get a mani-pedi at his favorite place. They ended up getting mani-pedis together, which they both enjoyed.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nTheir relationship hit a small snag when Tom wondered about her relationship with Owen. However, she allayed his fears and he invited her into his hotel room to have dinner.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy was working on the difficult case of [[Elizabeth Hall]], Tom was back at Hopkins. However, he came back and saw her being comforted by Owen.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nLater after having a snowball fight and hot cocoa, she came to his hotel room and they kissed and he shut the door.\n\n\nHis son David died at the age of ten when he was hit in the head with a baseball bat.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref> Tom always felt incredibly guilty over his death, always assuming he could have saved his son had they gotten to the hospital in time.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nAfter operating on Catherine, he went to the chapel to talk to his son and tell him his dad did well.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Catherine Fox]]\nHe has a history with [[Catherine Fox]]. They flirted a little bit when they ran into each other again at the hospital and she invited him to return for lectures in the future.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nTom later told Meredith that Catherine was the one who woke him back up after his son died, reminding him that he was still alive and shouldn't sleepwalk through his life.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAs her mentor, Amelia has professional respect for him, though she acknowledges and loathes his arrogance. He likes to take credit for her surgical skills. After her tumor was removed, he stayed to cover her service until she was cleared to return. However, she stopped him from leaving and asked him to join her on her first case back as she needed some hand-holding.\n\nAfter they operated together, he had sex with her after he told her she was a better surgeon than him. He later claimed he only said that to get her to sleep with him, though she didn't buy that. She also told him she dislikes him intensely.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nWhile they worked on their research together, Tom gave Amelia advice on how to get where she wanted to be with Owen.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\n\nDr. Koracick was the [[Attending#Department Head|head]] [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. He trained [[Amelia Shepherd]]. He helped to cover her service at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] while they planned to remove her tumor and stayed to do so until she was cleared to return to work. He later partnered with her on her innovation project regarding ultrasound ablation of inoperable gliomas and gained privileges at Grey Sloan to jump in and help out when necessary.\n\nCatherine appointed Tom Chief Medical Officer at the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]], meaning he was the Chief to all the Chiefs of Surgery at the Catherine Fox Medical Centers, [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] included. He then presumably quit his position at Johns Hopkins to spend his time at Grey Sloan, the best hospital of the Foundation. After he messed up a critical order of PPE during the COVID- pandemic, Catherine fired him and offered him an [[attending]] [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] position, which he accepted.\n\nAfter that, [[Richard Webber]], the new Chief Medical Officer, gave him his [[Resident#Program Director|Director of the Residency Program]] position at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\n*He plays music and sings along while operating.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*His Grey Sloan Memorial lab coat has Tom Koracick embroidered on it, while the lab coats usually display the\uadoctors' full first names.\n*He grew up Catholic.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n*He likes to play Operation before surgery to get himself in the mood.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxThomasKoracick.png\nxThomasKoracick.png\nxThomasKoracick.png\nxThomasKoracick.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThe following episodes are Tom-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life:\n*[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\n*[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\n*[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\n*[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]]\n*[[Sing It Again]]\n\n\n\n\n{{Tom Koracick Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Tom Koracick]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Koracick, Tom}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Five days later, he came back to the ER after falling down the stairs when his incision hadn't healed as quickly as he wanted. A CT revealed that Campbell had nicked the bile duct. Despite this mistake, John asked that Campbell do the repair herself.\n\nIn surgery, she quizzed Cristina, who believed she was a dinosaur who had no business operating anymore. When Cristina offended her, Campbell kicked her out of the OR. After the surgery, Owen talked to her about being discharged from the Army, saying the Army knew it was his time even though he didn't.\n\nShe later said she had decided that John's surgery would be her last.\n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nMargaret and Cristina Yang have a mutual dislike for each other.\n\n\nDr. Campbell was Seattle Grace's first female [[General Surgery|surgeon]] and the surgical generation above that of [[Richard Webber]] and [[Ellis Grey]]. [[Callie Torres|Callie]] describes her job as \"mostly she just sits around in her office and spreads prestige around, but she still does routine surgery now and then.\" She identifies herself as a God with a scalpel.\n\nIt was hinted that she taught Richard Webber and it has been years since he's been in her OR, and does not let him forget the time he dropped a clamp into an open body cavity. She worked with Ellis Grey, as is documented in [[Ellis Grey's Journals|her journal]], March rd , where Ellis assisted her on a splenectomy (surgical removal of a spleen), and is described as \"impressive r\uesum\ue, adequate technique\".\n\nCristina calls her \"a dinosaur that refuses to retire her scalpel\" after she does not use laparoscopic methods for a cholecystectomy on her patient, [[John Terzian]], who developed a post-operative infection, severe enough that Callie believe the infection is the reason Mr. Terzian collapsed. On a the [[Computed Tomography|CT]] scan, Cristina and Owen find a lacerated bowel duct and artery from her surgery; a mistake that should not have been made, open surgery or not.\n\nAs one of the most senior [[Surgery#Surgical Specialties|surgical]] [[Attending|attendings]] at Seattle Grace, she outranks [[Owen Hunt]] and he is forced to defend her choice of open surgery instead of minimally invasive surgery when explaining the problem to the patient, in contrast to Cristina's criticism of Dr. Campbell's choice of procedure.\n\nDuring surgery, she teaches Cristina, after criticizing the new teaching methods of inspiration, using the her methods of fear and shame she was taught with, asking Cristina how to perform a pulmonary embolectomy (removing a clot in the pulmonary vessels). Cristina correctly and accurately describes the procedure using \"newer\" methods (inserting a steel wire catheter into the femoral vein and removing the clot using a fluoroscope for guidance by placing the scope adjacent to the embolism), to which Dr. Campbell retorts with a power failure, or a hospital without a fluoroscope, leaving Yang speechless, and Dr. Campbell makes her point using an analogy of teaching mental arithmetic to young children and the use of calculators.

Arizona then asked Leah to show Emma where she could get scrubs, and so Leah did. In surgery, Emma tried to talk about the surgical electrothermal sealers, but Arizona and Alex had a conversation one night stands, Leah Murphy in particular.\n\nAfter surgery, she accidentally left her phone in the scrub room and she met Cristina when she later returned to pick it up. She asked Cristina about her cutting edge approach, and she told Cristina she was impressed by her enormous balls. Emma said she wished she could stick around to watch her surgery, but Cristina then informed her that she was Owen's ex, which Emma didn't know. The situation got awkward, and she quickly left after having told Cristina she couldn't wait to hear how the surgery went.\ua''(\"[[Map of You]]\")''\n\nAfter finding out about Owen's past marriage through her conversation with Cristina, Emma decided that Owen wasn't ready yet for a new relationship yet as he hadn't told her himself. She told him to call her when he was ready, which he did on Halloween. He left her a message to tell her that, in contrast to his relationship with Cristina where everything was difficult, she was simple and easy. He realized that it sounded wrong and asked her to delete the message. He hung up, but apparently Emma had listened to his message as he was leaving it, as she immediately called him back.\ua''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\n\nWhen an opening for maternal-fetal surgeon became available at Grey Sloan, Arizona thought of Emma first and pitched her to the board. They wanted one of them to sit down with Emma to interview her, and Callie was the chosen one. While Callie was eager to get to know Emma, Emma was informed by Arizona that Callie was her ex-wife. They met and after Owen introduced her to Callie, Emma and Callie entered a conference room for the interview.\n\nIn the interview, they looked over Emma's resume, which is impressive according to Callie. She revealed that she left [[Cleveland Clinic]] after a year because she was going through a divorce at the time. Callie was curious for details, and Emma told her some more. Callie asked her if it was hard for her to leave her city, which Emma found to be a difficult question to answer. When Callie asked Emma what her typical Saturday looks like, Emma said she had no problems with working in the weekends, but Callie was more wondering about what she did for fun. \"What feeds your soul?\" Callie asked, and Emma responded that she likes to read, to cook and to watch movies. Callie then asked if she had kids from her previous marriage, and when Emma said she hadn't, Callie wanted to know if she was interested in ever having kids. \"I don't think you can legally ask me this in a job interview,\" Emma said, but she did answer the question by saying she imagines having two girls in the future, even though she knows girls are hell in junior high. When Callie wanted to ask some more questions, Owen came in to ask how the interview was going, and Emma turned her head to tell him it was going great, Callie made very enthusiastic signals to Owen. When Emma turned her head back towards Callie, Callie said in a neutral voice that they were making progress.\ua\n\nAfter the interview, Arizona told Emma that Callie loved her. Emma said that Callie was thorough but very nice, and asked how long they'd been divorced. Arizona said that they weren't, just separated, and Emma noticed she still had the ring on her finger. She remarked that she was obviously seeing other people though, and Arizona said they were. Emma apologized for being so personal, and said that the job interview was more intimate than most rectal exams. \"We don't do things like this at Seattle Pres,\" Emma said, and Arizona then suggested to take the job, as the employees of Grey Sloan Memorial do way too personal on a daily basis.\ua\n\nThat night, Emma waited for Owen outside the hospital. Owen told her that everyone loves her, but Emma said she couldn't work at the hospital. She complimented the people working with him, but she thought that they were his people, who loved and cared about him. Emma said she didn't want to work with her husband again, because if she and Owen would break up, everyone at the hospital would choose him and she would just be the bitch who broke his heart. Owen asked if she was planning on breaking his heart, and she told him she wasn't. He then tried to get her to take the job, but she said she couldn't. She told him not to break her heart either and walked off. ''(\"[[Two Against One]]\")''\n\n\nWhile at GSM to prepare a grant proposal to fund her research, Emma was visited by several of the GSM doctors. One of them was Meredith, who tasted a muffin and, when learning that Emma had made them herself, said she wanted the leftovers if Emma was cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Emma and Owen realized they hadn't made plans for Thanksgiving and Meredith offered Emma the chance to cook at her house, because her kitchen is larger than Owen's and Emma's apartment was being painted. Throughout the course of the day, several others ended up being invited to the dinner, including Cristina. Emma said it was okay with her because Owen had told her he was over her. ''(\"[[Somebody That I Used to Know]]\")''\n\n\nEmma attended April and Matthew's failed wedding with Owen. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n\nAfter dating for several months, Owen and Emma talked about his living situation. He suggested that they move in together and she accepted. However, before they had a chance to choose a place, he cheated on her with Cristina. He broke up with her, but didn't tell her about the cheating. ''(\"[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nEmma seemed to take somewhat of an interest in Owen at the fundraising gala, where she complimented his looks, and later that night, she came to the hospital just to talk to him. ''(\"[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]\")'' After the evening she kept seeing him and even sent him homemade banana bread for work, which caused his colleagues to name her his girlfriend. ''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\nBy the time she came to the hospital to observe a surgery, Emma and Owen were dating. During her visit, she also met Cristina and found out from her about Owen and Cristina's past, which made her realize that Owen wasn't ready to date just yet. ''(\"[[Map of You]]\")'' She said goodbye to Owen, telling him to call her when he was ready to move on, and after some struggle and pondering, he did. ''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\nSome time later, Emma was offered a job at Grey Sloan, but she turned down the offer, not wanting to risk working at the same place with Owen and being left out if something were to happen between them. ''(\"[[Two Against One]]\")''\n\nWhen things between them got serious, Owen and Emma discussed getting a place together. However, later that same day, Cristina came to the trailer drunk and she and Owen slept together. Owen broke up with Emma the next day, saying they wanted different things, but leaving out that he had cheated on her. ''(\"[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]]\")''\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nEver since Emma came to the hospital to observe one of Arizona's teratoma surgeries, she and Arizona formed a good professional relationship. When a position of a [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal surgeon]] became available at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital|Grey Sloan Memorial]], Arizona immediately thought of Emma and pitched her to the board. Arizona really liked her and wanted her to take the job, though Emma eventually decided not to. ''(\"[[Two Against One]]\")''\n\n\nDr. Emma Marling is the\ua[[Attending#Department Head|head]] [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal surgeon]]\uaat\ua[[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]], where she started researching minimally invasive in utero teratomas. Dr. Marling was an [[Attending|attending]] for a year before she was promoted to run the department. Prior to working at Seattle Presbyterian, Dr. Marling was an [[attending]] at the [[Cleveland Clinic]], focusing on congenital heart disorders,\uafor a year and spent time at University of Washington Medical Center.\n\nWhen a maternal-fetal surgeon opening became available at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], Dr. Marling was recommended by head [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgeon]] [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]].

He is married to [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], whom he trained under in Boston before she moved to Seattle.\n\n\n\nWinston worked under Maggie while he was a resident at Tufts. He had a crush on her from the first day of residency even though she was his chief. The fact that she was younger than him only made him crush harder. He bided his time, but she moved to Seattle in mid-, right before he became an attending, so he never got a chance to ask her out.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nSix years later, for the third time in his life, Winston attended the Surgical Innovation Conference in Los Angeles. He spotted Maggie from across the room during heart valve happy hour and approached her. He admitted he had looked for her at earlier editions of the conference and was glad to have finally seen her there. He then told her about his crush, observed she wasn't wearing a wedding ring, and said he hoped he would finally be able take his shot and ask her out. They soon gave in to their mutual attraction and retreated to her room, where they had sex.\n[[File:x-.jpg|Winston and Maggie reconnect.|thumb]]\nAfterward, they had a walk by the hotel pool. With only  more hours left for the conference, they set out to get to know each other better. They did a lightning round. She described her perfect day to him, which sounded much like a romantic comedy. She then clarified she wanted to spend that day alone because she liked being alone, to a certain degree. He then started to describe his perfect day off, which started with morning sex with Maggie. They kissed again. Maggie then asked him who his favorite person was. He told her about his mother, who had died two years earlier from ovarian cancer. Maggie related because of her own mother's death. Maggie then inquired if having med conference flings was his thing. He admitted he had hooked up at conferences before, but he had never fallen this hard this fast for anyone. Maggie felt the same way.\n\nBack in bed once again, Winston recalled a time he scrubbed in with Maggie on a piggyback transplant. He was so nervous he was afraid he would drop the donor heart on the floor. Maggie told him she felt like that every time she saw him, except in the OR, where she is a hero. She said she was a neurotic mess in real life outside of the OR. Winston said he could not see that, which made her realize how much at ease she was around him. They were surprised by their alarm clocks. They had talked the entire night. As they got ready for the day, Maggie discovered he would be attending [[Richard Webber|Richard]]'s talk on his PATH pen later and she reminded him who Richard was. Winston thought it would be weird for him to meet Richard on what amounted to their first date, but Maggie said the whole thing had been weird. Yet perfect, he added. Instead of getting ready, they ended up making out again.\n[[File:x-.jpg|Winston asks Maggie to move to Boston.|thumb]]\nThey had breakfast separately, but he found her right before Richard's talk. He asked her to move back to Boston with him. He saw how flustered she was, so he offered to move to Seattle. He insisted that you can meet a person and just know they are the right person for you, and that was how he felt about her. After his mother's death, he had embraced \"carpe diem\" as his motto. He and Maggie quoted their second favorite movie, Dead Poet's Society, once again showing how well they matched are. Maggie said she was a person who needed time to weigh and measure pros and cons before making decisions. He happily agreed to give her the time to do so but he said he knew his feelings about her wouldn't change. They then headed in for the talk, where Richard started showing signs of being unwell. Winston watched from the audience as Maggie got on stage to make Richard stop his talk and get him off the stage. Maggie then walked with Richard on a gurney, past Winston, as they left the conference.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing the conference, Winston returned to Boston and Maggie returned to Seattle, but the two continued their relationship long distance. They video chatted frequently, discussing the pandemic, their patients, the ways in which the virus was disproportionately affecting people of color, and shared how their families were doing. Maggie shared stories about her time spent with her nieces, nephews, and sisters and Winston shared stories about his grandmother and his coworkers.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> After Maggie told him a story about how she had a picnic with [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] that turned into a sleepover on the laundry room floor, Winston bought her a tent and had it shipped to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] house in Seattle. He arranged with [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] and [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]] for it to be set up in the backyard as a surprise for Maggie.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith contracted COVID-, Maggie shared her fears with Winston and he comforted her. During this time, Winston invited Maggie to a virtual family dinner for his grandmother's birthday, which Maggie accepted. The dinner was going well until Winston's father joined the call and proceeded to mock and insult Winston and his intelligence. Winston and his father argued as a result, which ended in Winston leaving the call, leaving Maggie to make awkward small talk with his family. Winston later called Maggie to talk about it, telling her that his Dad makes him crazy and that he seems charming, but he has a temper. To make it up to her, Winston arranged for the two of them to watch the movie Coming to America over video chat.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith woke up after being unconscious for eight days, Maggie shared the good news with Winston over FaceTime. Winston told her he was happy to hear that, but ended the call quickly, saying he was in his car at a grocery store parking lot and needed to go buy eggs, leaving Maggie upset and confused. Later that night, Maggie was alone in her hotel room when someone knocked on the door. She opened it to find Winston, who had brought her flowers from the grocery store. He told her that the long distance thing wasn't working for him anymore and they embraced.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nThe following day he and Maggie ordered room service for breakfast and enjoyed the morning together until [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] knocked on their door and told Maggie that she was needed at home. Winston, Maggie, and Jackson went to Meredith\us house and after confirming that they\ud all been tested recently Link invited them in. Maggie went to talk to Amelia about how to tell the kids about Meredith and Winston joined Link and Jackson in the back for beers. Link paced around the backyard holding Scout who he told them would start crying if he stopped moving while talking about Meredith\us worsening condition and the impact her death would have on the kids, Amelia, and his life in general. Realizing what he just said Link felt guilty, but Winston and Jackson reassured him that it was okay and that they all want Meredith to live and not all of the reasons for that have to be selfless. Winston reassured him by telling him that all they can do is keep moving physically and metaphorically. Link commented that Winston was good at reassuring people considering they just met. He then thanked Jackson for getting Maggie to the house even though he knew it was probably awkward and Winston suddenly realized that Jackson was Maggie's ex.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], X</ref>\n\n\nAfter the unexpected death of [[Andrew DeLuca]], Winston comforted Maggie and did his best to support her, Amelia, and Link. While spending time with Meredith's kids, Winston volunteered to take Maggie's place when Zola told her it was her turn to dance with them and she was unable to do so because of her grief. He offered to show the kids some East Coast dance moves and they gladly accepted. Later that day, Maggie gave Winston hospital privileges and they worked together to treat [[Byron Gibbis]], who was admitted after being found passed out on his front porch. After examining him, Winston diagnosed him with endocarditis, but they couldn't figure out the underlying cause until they took him for a CT scan and Winston asked him if he'd had trouble with his teeth. He said he'd picked a popcorn kernel out with his teeth with a paper clip and had sore gums, but had refused to leave his house to go to the dentist. They were about to begin Gibbis's surgery when he got scared and ran out of the OR naked. Winston and Maggie tracked him down with some help from [[Zander Perez]] and Maggie managed to calm him down and convince him to have the surgery. They helped him back to the OR and the surgery went ahead as planned. He later accompanied Maggie to the outdoor memorial that was held for Andrew.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Maggie gave him privileges, Winston continued to work with her to treat COVID patients at the hospital. They spent time together listening to playlists he created by sharing earbuds. Then the time came for him to go back to Boston as the city had experienced another surge and cases were climbing there and he was needed back at Tufts. Maggie didn't want him to go. The two of them sharing ear buds gave Maggie an idea about how to increase ventilator capacity by having patients share a ventilator by splitting the tube in two and filtering the air to avoid contamination. At the end of their shift, Maggie told Winston her job finally felt fun again and that she knew he was needed back in Boston but that she didn't want to be without him. While Maggie tried to ask him to stay, Winston told her he wanted them to listen to one last song before he left and opened his earbud case to reveal a ring. Winston proposed to Maggie and told her she had an out if she wanted one. Maggie accepted his proposal and they kissed.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Maggie accepted his proposal, Winston travelled back to Boston to tie up lose ends. When he was done, he packed up all of his things and drove back to Seattle. He and Maggie texted and video called frequently during this time and he found an apartment that he wanted Maggie to look at. Maggie took a bit to get back to him and when she did she told him she wasn't a fan of the listing. He told her the landlord of the apartment had called previously to inform him he needed a decision today so he told the landlord he would take it as he needed a better option than a hotel or tent in the backyard. He had been driving for three days and had just left a gas station when he was pulled over by the police while he was on the phone with Maggie. Winston assumed a safe position with his hands on the steering wheel and his license and registration in his hand as a sheriff walked up to this window while his partner circled the car with a drug-sniffing dog. Winston asked him why he was pulled over and upon hearing Maggie's worried voice through the phone, the sheriff checking Winston's license demanded that he turn off his phone. Winston cautiously told him his fianc\uee was worried but ultimately complied, fearing for his life. Maggie then attempted to call him multiple times with no response. When Maggie got called back into a trauma when her patient, [[Guy Houston]], went into V-fib again, she handed her phone to intern [[Sara Ortiz]], explained the situation, and told her to keep calling Winston until he picked up.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Guy needed surgery, Maggie paged Richard and explained the situation and that she hadn't been able to reach Winston for the last  minutes. Richard asked for her phone and told her to focus on her patient and that he'd keep calling and if there a wasn't response in a little while, he would go looking for Winston himself. Maggie had just finished moving a catheter into place when Winston called back. Richard let her know and Owen said he'd finish up so that she could talk to Winston. Winston told her he was fine, but that the police made him do a DUI test, had the police dog sniff him and his car, and then unpacked and ransacked all of his stuff, which was now strewn about the side of the road and then had the dog sniff all of that on the grounds that his bike rack was obscuring his license plate. Winston was shaken up and traumatized, but was relieved to have made it out alive. He told Maggie he wasn't good to drive yet and that he needed a moment to catch his breath, so Maggie stayed on the phone with him. Eventually, he got back on the road after talking to Maggie and a couple of hours later arrived at Meredith's house. Maggie and Amelia were waiting on the porch for him. When he arrived, Maggie ran over and embraced him and he told her he thought only about surviving to get back to her. In response, Maggie kissed him.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing his move to Seattle, Winston joined the staff of Grey Sloan Memorial as an attending and worked with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] on Meredith\us case. Her labs showed elevated liver enzymes, so they did a CT of her chest and abdomen. After discovering a clot in her liver Winston declined to do the necessary TIPS procedure because Meredith was his future sister-in-law and said Teddy should do it instead. Teddy prepared to do the procedure herself, but then changed her mind after talking to [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] and had him page Winston to assist. The procedure was successful, but Meredith still wasn\ut able to stay awake, so Winston suggested to Richard that they bring Zola to visit her mom because he thought that hearing and feeling her daughter next to her might help. At first Maggie refused to bring her, but after Zola overheard her talking and said she wanted to go Maggie brought her to the hospital. After putting her in PPE Winston, Maggie, and Richard walked Zola to Meredith\us room and waited outside to see if it would help. At first there was no change, but then Meredith woke up and started talking to Zola. Seeing this Winston celebrated with Maggie, Richard, Amelia, [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]], and Teddy.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\nIn the weeks that followed Winston worked with Maggie, Teddy, Owen, and Link to treat COVID patients. After getting engaged Winston and Maggie asked Richard to officiate their wedding and he gladly accepted saying it would be the honor of his life.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref> Following their engagement, Winston and Maggie began wedding planning. They got into a disagreement when Maggie told him she wanted everything to feel right instead of a compromise and suggested they wait until things open up a bit more. Winston became upset because he thought she was all in and that she was getting cold feet. Three weeks later, Maggie met Winston in the hospital parking lot and told him that none of his ideas were perfect and that she had finally figured out what had been bothering her. She realized that perfect was never going to be an option because her mother wouldn\ut be there and the feeling that something was wrong never had anything to do with him. She just wished her mother could have met him. Winston told her he missed his own mom as well, that his mom taught him how to dance, and would\uve torn up the dance floor at their wedding. Maggie then suggested they take the engagement ring that her mother gave her and turn it into her wedding band and that she didn\ut want to wait to have the wedding. That they should get her dad and his grandmother to Seattle as soon as possible and just do the wedding with family and then have a big party when it's safe to do so. Winston told her he was good with that idea and Maggie said she was relieved before turning towards a parked car and revealing that she had flown her dad [[Bill Pierce|Bill]] and Winston\us grandmother [[Antoinette Ndugu|Antoinette]] out for the wedding. They wanted to hug them, but couldn\ut until they had quarantined for  days. None the less they were delighted to see each other.<ref>[[I'm Still Standing]], x</ref>\n\n\nIn August , Winston and Maggie attempted to get married at a small ceremony in Meredith's backyard with Antoinette, Bill, [[Catherine Fox|Catherine]], Link, and Meredith and her kids in attendance. However, when Richard asked if anyone objected to the union Antoinette and Bill stood up and said that they did because they both thought that the couple deserved a bigger ceremony than this and that it wasn't right to do it this way because Amelia wasn't there, having been called into work at the last minute for an emergent patient, and Maggie had uncles, aunts, and cousins who weren't there. Bill said he had a savings account to do this the right way and that's what they wanted for them. Maggie told them they couldn't do it the proper way because it wasn't safe. Bill suggested that they wait as they were already living together so they couldn't be in that much of a hurry. Winston and Maggie then agreed to postpone the wedding. In April , when it was safe to do so Winston and Maggie got married at the beach with all of their friends and family that they wanted in attendance. They had Meredith walk down the aisle with her kids and spread flower petals at the start of the ceremony then Bill walked Maggie down the aisle. This time no one objected and the wedding went ahead as planned. While Meredith and Teddy had to leave early to perform a lung transplant on one of their patients, everyone else stayed and enjoyed the reception and dancing with Winston and Maggie.<ref>[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter his mother's death, he adapted a \"carpe diem\" mentality. He is a charming and humorous man. He likes to dance and has been shown to be good with kids. \n\n\n\nWinston had a crush on his superior, Maggie Pierce, starting the first day of his residency training under her. He bided his time to ask her out on a date, but she left Boston right before he became an attending.

I'm out of debt.|'''Izzie Stevens'''}}\n\n'''Izzie Stevens''' is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Surgical Oncology|surgical oncologist]]. She was a surgical resident at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] until she was fired shortly after the merger with [[Mercy West Medical Center]]. Engaged to [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]] until his death, she is now in a relationship with her ex-husband, [[Alex Karev]]. Together, they have twins, [[Alexis Stevens|Alexis]] and [[Eli Stevens|Eli]].\n\n\n\nIzzie grew up in Forest Park, on Route , behind a church in Chehalis, Washington.<ref name=\":\">[[Break on Through]], x</ref> She lived in a trailer park with her [[Robbie Stevens|mother]] who nicknamed her \"Cricket\"<ref>[[Save Me]], x</ref> Sometimebefore her residency, her maternal grandmother died of thyroid cancer.<ref name=\":\" />\n\nAs a teenager, Izzie worked as a waitress and had savings for college, but her mother spent most of the saved money on psychics. This forced Izzie to pay most of the bills with her own money. \n\nAt age fifteen, Izzie became pregnant.<ref>[[New History]], x</ref> She gave birth to a baby girl and placed her for adoption at sixteen in order to give her a better life. She secretly named the girl Sarah, but her parents named her [[Hannah Klein|Hannah]].<ref name=\":\" /> Because of her pregnancy, mothers made their children stay away from Izzie so she struggled to make friends.\n\nAt her high school prom, the football quarterback was her date. Since her school didn't have a lot of money, they just converted the gym.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nWhen she turned eighteen, she left home. She paid for medical school by modeling designer \"[[Bethany Whisper]],\" which led to her receiving the nickname \"Dr. Model.\"<ref>[[No Man's Land]], x</ref>\n\nShe attended the [[University of Washington School of Medicine]].\n\n\nIzzie started out as an intern at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] under fourth-year resident [[Miranda Bailey]], alongside [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], and [[George O'Malley]]. She and George soon became Meredith's roommates.\n\n[[Alex Karev]] was later reassigned as Miranda's resident.\n\n\nIzzie developed a strong relationship with Alex, but was subsequently mocked for it.\n\nAlex took Izzie out on a date, but Izzie was insulted that he wasn't acting like himself and he didn't bother to kiss her goodnight, not knowing that Alex felt \"off his game\" because he heard that he failed his boards. Izzie was annoyed at Alex for ruining the date and not kissing her until Alex went to Joe's and kissed her passionately. This sparked their first relationship, though Alex still struggled to become intimate with Izzie. \n\nLater, Izzie saw Alex and [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]] having sex in an on-call room, devastating her. When Alex was studying for his boards, Izzie finally broke down in front of him as she tried to help him study. Eventually, she was able to forgive Alex, and they were on friendly terms again.\n\nTheir feelings for each other started to spark again after Izzie and Alex had sex for the first time following the bomb in the body cavity incident. They were on the brink of a second go at a relationship when [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]] returned to the hospital, re-igniting Izzie's interest in him.\n\n\nIzzie met Denny, a cardio patient, who immediately took a liking to Izzie. As time went on, the two got closer to the point that they fell in love with each other. Still, Denny needed a new heart, only alive due to his [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]].\n\nA heart became available, but when the heart donor flat-lined, Burke and Alex attempted to take [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Hahn's]] heart in order for Denny to receive a heart that day. However, Hahn's transplant patient had been put on the donor list  seconds before Denny. Knowing the only way that Denny would get the heart would be if his condition worsened immediately, Izzie cut Denny's LVAD wire so that this would happen. Upon arrival at Seattle Grace, Burke was shot and Hahn was needed to do the surgery. While the surgery was completed successfully, Denny soon after died from an unexpected stroke.\n\nAfter Denny died, Izzie confessed to Chief Webber that she cut the LVAD wire, but she felt she was no longer a doctor. She quit the program. After some time mourning Denny, endlessly baking and a visit from [[Miranda Bailey]], Izzie started to heal. Initially intending to clean out her locker, Izzie watched Cristina stitching up a heart from the gallery. This reignited her passion for medicine, and she returned to Seattle Grace. The Chief put her on probation, with Dr. Bailey adding extra punishments such as only observing and no talking or interacting with patients. She was eventually taken off of probation after helping a victim of the [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] crash.<ref>[[Drowning on Dry Land]], x</ref>\n\nIzzie received an inheritance check from Denny for $.M. She didn't deposit the check for a while, which stressed her roommates out. Finally, Izzie deposited the check but was unsure how to spend it as she wanted Denny's money to go towards something meaningful. When [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] got approval for a free clinic, Izzie realized Denny's money could fund it, and she put almost all of her inheritance towards the new clinic, naming it the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]]. \n\n\nIzzie became a second-year resident at Seattle Grace after passing her intern exams. Her first day on the job resulted in her treating a deer in the back of a pick-up truck which her new interns thought was ridiculous and a waste of her time.\n\nAs she struggled to get her feet grounded, she became more infatuated with George and his life, practically waiting for his marriage to [[Callie Torres]] to implode. After a bad fight with Callie, George came over to drink with Izzie, and they ended up drunkenly sleeping together. Izzie remembered everything the next morning, but it wasn't until later in the day that their night together came back to George. Both initially agreed to keep it a secret between each other, saying it would never happen again and it didn't mean anything. As time wore on, both Izzie and George realized they did indeed have feelings for each other, and George agreed to tell Callie about his one-night stand. After doing so, Izzie and George attempted a relationship but discovered that their sexual chemistry was non-existent apart from that first night. Their relationship fizzled out, and George moved into an apartment with [[Lexie Grey]].\n\n\n\n\nIzzie started hallucinating her dead fianc\ue, [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette.]] \n\nIzzie discovered that she was misdiagnosed with anemia when she actually had high LDH levels. She went into a private room and started to examine her body for any enlarged lymph nodes or suspicious moles. She then discovered a mole on her back. Izzie and [[George O'Malley]] went to dermatology, [[Daisy Pepman]] removed her mole and told her she shouldn't be worried about it. Daisy later came back with her results that the mole was malignant.. Izzie gathers her interns and creates \"Patient X\" who is actually Izzie, had her interns try to diagnose her. The interns conclude that \"Patient X\" is fine, and at most she has an anxiety disorder. This makes Izzie very frustrated, saying \"Patient X\" has been having visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations. \n\nIzzie is conversing with George when [[Lexie Grey]] comes up to her, explaining they have new on \"Patient X\". Lexie explained they should check for a malignancy in the brain. Which was done by using an MRI. Izzie had multiple scans including an upper G.I., and a head CT before that.The interns later diagnose her with Stage IV metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, brain, and skin, with a % survival rate. Izzie later asked what Lexie would say to \"Patient X\" if she had the chance. Lexie says \"Patient X\"  should screw the odds and argues that her mother died of the hiccups, which probably have a % survival rate.[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|riht|px|Izzie gets treated for her cancer.]]\nIzzie chose to tell Cristina about her cancer, and Cristina set her up with the best surgical oncologist in the state as well as producing masses of research, but Izzie chose to blow off the appointment, making Cristina wonder why she ever confided in her to begin with. Eventually, Cristina couldn't handle the pressure and told an OR full of staff, including Alex and Bailey, of Izzie's diagnosis, which gave Izzie the final push to fight for her life, and she finally admitted herself into Seattle Grace as a patient.\n\nIzzie's first part of her treatment was to have the temporal lobe metastases removed by Derek, who returned to surgery to operate on Izzie following his breakdown. Meredith also suggested to Izzie that she has obstetrics remove healthy eggs from her, for her future. The first stage of her treatment was successful, as Derek removed the tumor fully from Izzie's temporal lobe, no thanks to [[Rebecca Swender]], Izzie's oncologist who constantly second-guessed Derek during surgery until Derek found his rhythm and quiets Dr. Swender.\n\nFollowing the news of her cancer and Meredith and Derek's wedding, she began to plan the wedding and even created [[Meredith and Derek's Wedding Website]]. However, after discovering another tumor in her brain due to the appearance of Denny, Meredith and Derek gave away their wedding to Izzie and Alex and they got married. She then did the risky surgery, and the tumor was successfully removed.\n[[File:Izziecomesbacktolife.png|thumb|xpx|Izzie's DNR order is ignored and successfully resuscitated.]]\nWhile Alex embraced Izzie after realizing that some of her memory returned, Izzie went limp and her pressure started dropping. Alex called for Cristina, who arrived shortly before Richard Webber and Miranda Bailey arrived and he demanded that they resuscitate her, but Cristina told the others that Izzie signed a DNR. Initially, the other doctors wanted to abide by the DNR, but Richard soon gave in, stating, \"Screw the DNR,\" and started to resuscitate her.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\nDuring the budget cuts at Seattle Grace, Izzie accidentally administered an incorrect dosage of medicine to a patient, causing her not to get a much-needed kidney transplant. This caused Chief Webber to fire her. Thinking [[Alex Karev|Alex]] was partly to blame, Izzie wrote him a letter and left.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Alex and Izzie say goodbye. ]]\n\nIzzie later returned to Seattle for a final PET scan and to ask Derek to put in a good word for her, so she could get a job in Tacoma and repair things with Alex. Derek learned that Tacoma didn't want to hire her because of her history, but he planned on hiring Izzie back once he was given the job of Chief of Surgery. At the same time, Izzie went to show Alex that her scan was clean, meaning she was officially not dying of cancer. He was genuinely happy for her but felt he deserved better. Knowing she was okay, he told her to leave, be happy, and not come back. Realizing that there was nothing left to repair, Izzie went to Meredith's house to pack her stuff. Meredith begged her not to throw the people that loved her aside and not to leave, as it was her home. Izzie responded saying that Seattle Grace wasn't her home anymore, that it was just a place she used to work at and she can do that anywhere. This makes a tearful Meredith frown and turn away, letting her go. As Izzie exhales, she is left to start all over again somewhere else.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref> \n\n\nAround four years after leaving Seattle, Izzie was single and wanted children. Due to chemo for the cancer, she lost the ability to get pregnant, and she used the frozen embryos from before treatment to try and have kids. It was successful and she gave birth to twins, whom she named Eli and Alexis. The three of them live out on the country in Baldwin City, Kansas, where she now works as a surgical oncologist.\n[[File:xIzzieStevens.png|thumb|Alex and Izzie with their twins.]]\nFive years after having twins, Meredith's medical license was in jeopardy. Alex called her to see if she could write a letter of support in the trial. Alex admitted the trial gave him an excuse to call her and see how she was doing many years later. As Alex and Izzie talked, he described it being as if no time had passed between them and felt they left something unfinished. He later learned she had kids, and that in fact the kids were his. He then got on with the trial and went to see her and the kids. He eventually decided to stay with Izzie and their twins to build a life together.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\n\nIzzie always thinks there's some good in people, no matter how bad they are. Her motivations are always for what she believes to be the right thing. She is very optimistic, bubbly, and bright. The first impression she gives is a confident and friendly woman.\n\nShe is also very kind, protective, and often stubborn. She seems to get too emotionally involved in most cases, which she sees as a good thing, although others feel it gets in the way of the medicine.\n\nIzzie is very loyal to all her friends, and in most cases, can be trusted. She likes seeing others happy and is constantly trying to cheer people up. This attitude, however, is not extended to certain individuals. For example, she goes out of her way every chance she gets to belittle and bring down George and Callie after they eloped, eventually breaking the marriage up completely by sleeping with George. During the entire time she knew Callie, Izzie acted like a childish and inappropriate individual; constantly laughing at her and poking fun of intimate details about Callie\us life she had only wanted George to know. She is also a hopeless romantic. She bakes/cleans a lot almost to an obsessive level when she is sad or stressed.\n\nIzzie can often be taken as a meddler when she tries to help people when they do not necessarily ask for help. She can really bring the pain if she believes she has been wronged or hurt emotionally. She can hold a grudge or retaliate when someone tries to take advantage of her kindness and good intentions.\n\n\n\n[[Hank]]\nWhen she started her internship, Izzie was dating the professional hockey player Hank. They soon broke up due to her long working hours and distance.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nWhen [[Alex Karev]] discovered her history as a model, he didn't waste any time in putting up her lingerie advertisements all over [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Despite the incident, she saw through Alex's shallow, callous exterior and befriended him, to the shock of her friends.\n\nWhen he eventually asked her out, she was disappointed that he didn't have the courage to kiss her. For a while she refused to speak to him until spontaneously at Joe's bar, he kissed her.\n\nDespite dating Alex, a heart patient named Denny Duquette continually flirted with her. It led nowhere and he left the hospital shortly after they met after failing to receive a new heart.\n\n[[File:Alex_izzie_kiss.jpg|thumb|px|Alex and Izzie kiss.]]\n\nDue to some difficulties on Alex's part, their sexual relationship didn't take off. And after Izzie caught Alex sleeping with [[Olivia Jankovic|Nurse Olivia]], she ended their relationship and was furious with him. When Izzie discovered her friends were helping Alex study for his failed boards she blew up at them although she eventually forgave him and helped him study as well. Even though she forgave him she ruled out the possibility of another relationship with him.\n\nWhen there was a bomb scare in the hospital, Izzie felt she needed to do what she wanted before it was too late. She proceeded to have sex with Alex in a linen closet again several times throughout the day. Alex assumed that they were dating again but Meredith told him that they were only sleeping together and Izzie wouldn't ever think of him the same after his incident with [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]].\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Alex and Izzie get married.]]\n\nLater, Izzie gave [[Alex Karev|Alex]] an ultimatum. She told him either to be the nice guy or the jerk but he couldn't be both. He kissed her and they later decided to go steady. Things went well but Denny began to appear to Izzie and she even had sex with him. Shockingly, it turned out that the appearances of Denny were because of an illness she had.\n\nMeredith and Derek gave their wedding to Izzie after discovering her tumor and she got married to Alex.\n\nIzzie's time with cancer was rough, and it took a toll on her relationship with Alex. After she was fired from SGMW, she left Alex. Eventually, she did come back, wanting to reunite with Alex when she found out her cancer was gone. However, he refused, wanting someone who would stay. Soon afterwards, she sent him divorce papers and he signed them.\n\nWhen Meredith needed letters for her trial, Alex called Izzie, and in their conversation she revealed that she had given birth to twins, using a frozen embryo that she and Alex had saved when she was starting her cancer treatment. He went to Kansas to visit them, decided to stay, and began a life with Izzie and their family.\n\n[[Denny Duquette, Jr.]]\nWhen Denny was readmitted to the hospital after suffering cardiac dysrhythmia, Izzie brushed Alex off so she could tend to Denny. Alex felt threatened by Denny so he told Denny he should back off because he would probably die from heart failure and if he did it would hurt Izzie. When Izzie found out that Alex said this to Denny, she confronted him and he replied that she could not get involved with patients. She later realized that she did not have to settle for Alex.\n[[File:Cutting the LVAD.jpg|thumb|xpx|Izzie cuts Denny's LVAD wire]]\n\nHowever, Denny survived and they grew closer. He had an [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] inserted to keep him alive for longer so he could wait for a heart, but after finding out that Denny had become a DNR (do not resuscitate) patient, Izzie jumped at the chance to get him a new heart. After discovering that he lost a donor heart to someone on the donor list who was ahead of him by  seconds, she implored him to let her cut his [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire so his condition would worsen and he would move up on the donor list. At first, Denny refused because it would end her medical career and he didn't want to steal a heart out of another man's chest but after Izzie broke down crying and begged him, he agreed. Izzie cut Denny's LVAD wire and sought the help of her fellow interns to keep him alive.\nAs the interns struggled to keep Denny alive, Cristina informed them that Denny's surgeon, [[Preston Burke]], was shot and struggling to survive. After hearing the news, Izzie panicked, completely at a loss. In the midst of the chaos, Denny proposed to a shocked Izzie. [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] walked in on the interns and banned them all from any surgeries until the person who cut the LVAD wire confessed. Meanwhile, Alex invited Dr. Erica Hahn to replace Dr. Burke on Denny's heart transplant surgery. Dr. Hahn successfully completed Denny's transplant surgery and when Izzie visited Denny after his transplant she accepted his marriage proposal. Denny died from a stroke shortly thereafter leaving Izzie devastated and lying next to Denny's body. Alex carried her off the bed and told her that the body wasn't Denny and that Denny loved her and he wouldn't want Izzie to do this to herself. After a long period of mourning, Izzie moved on but refused Alex's offer of a relationship.[[Image:x-.jpg|right|thumb|px|Izzie lying with a deceased Denny.]]\n[[George O'Malley]]\nWhen Izzie discovered that George liked Meredith, she encouraged him to tell her. Eventually, he did but after his disastrous sexual encounter with her, he moved out of the house, much to Izzie's disappointment. Despite several attempts, George refuses to tell Izzie where he is currently living. Eventually, he moved back in and frequently had his new girlfriend, [[Callie Torres|Dr. Callie Torres]], over, much to Izzie's dismay. Izzie made it very clear to George that she disapproved of her presence in his life because she considered Callie a freak. After taking multiple jibes, Callie told George it was because Izzie was in love with him.\n\nAfter Callie disclosed the fact that she was somewhat wealthy and was paying most of their bills herself and didn't mind doing so, a hurt George told Meredith, who told Izzie. Izzie used this information when making a snide remark about Callie, knowing it would hit a nerve. Infuriated at his indiscretion, Callie kicked George out of their hotel room after voicing her opinion that Izzie \"had feelings\" for George. Upset and confused, George went to Izzie and Meredith's house with a bottle of bourbon and after getting drunk, Izzie and George slept together. The next day, George had no recollection of their intimacy the previous night and didn't remember until he was having lunch with Callie and her father. George confronted Izzie about it in a linen closet at the hospital and after they almost kissed, George left in a surge of guilt. Later, Izzie wanted to tell Callie but George insisted that it be kept a secret.\n\nWhile dealing with the aftermath of her sexual encounter with George, Izzie was visited by the adoptive parents of the child she had given up years before. Hannah, now , is sick with leukemia and her donor for a bone marrow transplant had died the previous night. Izzie asked if she could meet Hannah, her parents agreed if Hannah wanted to. Izzie agreed to donate bone marrow to save her daughter's life, causing her emotional grief, Dr. Bailey helped Izzie keep her daughter a secret from the other interns and helped her during the beginning of the bone marrow harvest. Hannah's parents informed Izzie that Hannah was tired and maybe Izzie could meet Hannah when she was better. Despite this, Izzie still agreed to donate bone marrow. George noticed Izzie crying earlier and went to find her. He stayed with her for the rest of the harvest, setting aside other emotions. In the recovery room, Izzie confides in George that she has a daughter and says she needs their friendship to survive even though the sex wasn't tragic like the encounter with him and Meredith. George was still conflicted with his feelings for Izzie and his guilt in betraying Callie, he left Izzie crying in the room, only to return once he realized Izzie needed help as a friend. George came with Izzie when she saw her daughter for the first time, noting that [[Hannah Klein|Hannah]] had Izzie's eyes and mouth.\n\n[[Image:x-.JPG|thumb|left|px|right|Izzie, Meredith and George at Christmas.]]\n\nFollowing this, Izzie and George pretended that everything was fine, and continued to spend time together as friends. As Callie became more suspicious, she confronted Izzie and begged her to relinquish George which prompted Izzie to guiltily withdraw from him. She and George both realized they couldn't pretend their sexual encounter never happened, especially because their feelings for each other keep getting in the way. The combination of all these factors leads George to decide to transfer to Mercy West.\n\nAfter George received a letter telling him he'd been accepted to [[Mercy West Medical Center]], pending the results of the intern exam, Izzie tried to convince him not to leave by saying she had no romantic feelings towards him. Izzie later admitted to George that she was in love with him, leaving him speechless.\n\n[[George O'Malley|George]] later admitted he loved Izzie too, despite his strange reaction to her when she confessed her love to him. Their relationship was soon discovered by George's wife, [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and the two got a divorce. After some time, George and Izzie realized that their relationship was not working as they had very little chemistry. They broke up but continued to have a close friendship.\n\n\n[[Robbie Stevens]]\n[[File:xIzziesmom.png|thumb|xpx|Izzie and her mother hug.]]\nWhen Izzie was diagnosed with cancer, her mother Robbie visited the hospital, unaware of how bad the cancer was. Before she left, she said to Izzie that she always knew she was too good for the trailer park. Izzie said she loved her mother, but they work better at a distance.<ref name=\":\">[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]], x</ref> She later went to live with her mother in Chehalis for a few months in the Winter after she left Alex. \n\nGrammy \nHer grandmother had a tumor on her thyroid and eventually died of thyroid cancer.<ref>[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]], x</ref>\n\n\nIzzie quickly befriended her fellow interns, [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], and [[George O'Malley]]. She bonded fastest with George. After a rough start with Alex, she became friends with him too.\n\nAfter her marriage, Izzie decided to introduce him to her patient friends: Austin, Star, Miguel, Meg, and Alison. Izzie bonded well with [[ Alison Clark|Alison]], who was similar to Izzie. They had similar cancer, age, and treatment plans. On discovering Alison decided against surgery for her brain metastases and discovering the IL- therapy was working, Izzie was torn between having surgery or not. She tried to get the opinion of Alex, Cristina, Meredith, and George. Cristina and Meredith did not agree with the surgery. With IL- therapy, after three months, the mets were gone. Alex said their life together was at stake and eventually urged for the surgery, however. After Alison's death, Izzie signed a DNR and went through surgery. Webber, Bailey and Cristina ignored the DNR order by Izzie and attempted to resuscitate her when she crashed.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Image:Illness.png|thumb|right|px|right|Izzie's (incorrect) test results.]]\nShe attended [[University of Washington School of Medicine]].\n\nAt the beginning of her internship, Izzie struggled with others' assumptions of her as an incompetent doctor, due to the fact that she used to be a lingerie model.\n\nIzzie was a reasonably good doctor but when she cut Denny Duquette's [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire, she was going to be suspended but instead quit. [[Alex Karev]] later convinced [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] to talk to Izzie and make her come back which Bailey succeeded in doing. Bailey convinced the Chief to let her return but with a strict probation which doesn't allow her to have contact with patients and an inferiority to her fellow interns. Izzie became dissatisfied with the limited amount of medical work she could do and frequently tried to push the boundaries of her probation. She even donated most of her money from [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette's]] check to a free clinic where she and Bailey often worked.\n\nDuring an emergency involving a ferry accident, Izzie saved a man's life by drilling burr holes into his skull with an ordinary drill in the field. This prompted an impressed chief to take her off probation and allow her to finish the rest of the procedure by drilling more burr holes but this time with a real high-speed surgical drill.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] told [[Richard Webber]] that Izzie had the potential to be an extremely gifted [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]], one of the best she had seen in years but she was worried because she seemed to get too close to her patients. After using a tactic of assigning Izzie to a patient that would inevitably die, Izzie left obstetrics.\n\n[[File:Off probation.jpg|thumb|left|px|Izzie is off probation.]]\n\nIzzie decided to try going into cardiothoracic surgery but was met by a determined [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], who was also trying to make a career in the same department. She eventually decided that she was not suited for the specialty and stopped pursuing it.\n\nAfter Bailey realized she had too many things to look after, she handed over the keys of the clinic to Izzie, giving it to her.\n\nWhen her interns (and the others) started to dislike being doctors since they were banned from surgery, Izzie set up a competition, won by Lexie. When she realized that Denny appearing was because she was sick, the set up a competition to diagnose patient X. When she discovered that she had cancer and other people started to learn, she finally admitted herself as a patient, she just designed Meredith and Derek's wedding and was quizzed on medical trivia by Bailey.\n\nShe quickly got back on her feet and continued working as a surgeon, although some thought it was too soon and after concerns from Owen Hunt, Derek Shepherd and Alex, Izzie was fired during the merger with Mercy West, although the chief used the standard speech and claimed it was due to budget cutbacks. After this Izzie left a note in Alex's cubby and left him.\n\nShe relocated to Baldwin City, Kansas and became a [[Surgical Oncology|surgical oncologist]].\n\n\n*She is an excellent baker and obsessive cleaner.\n*She can't cook, as revealed when she plans a Thanksgiving dinner for her roommates, relying on internet recipes.\n* She is Catholic.\n* Her glove size is .\n*Izzie says she always chooses the dog piece when she plays Monopoly.\n* She enjoys baking her mother's chocolate cupcakes and finds out the secret ingredient is coconut extract.\n*Izzie only ever sees Denny when she hallucinates, as he is the person she associates most with death.\n*From the original interns, Izzie is the only female one who did not sleep with an attending. On top of that, she is to date also the only main character who, as a resident, never slept with someone higher in rank during their on-screen education.\n*She has a tattoo of a butterfly and claims to have others in interesting places.\n*Izzie is ''' years old''' in her first year of residency.<ref>[[Break on Through]], x</ref><ref>[[Time After Time]], x</ref>  She later celebrated her '''th''' birthday as a second-year resident.<ref>[[Wish You Were Here]], x</ref><ref>[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]], x</ref>, which occurs in the year ''''''<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref> This correspondingly makes her year of birth '''''', having turned  by the end of her intern year.\n**A visual clue shows a production error<ref name=\":\">'''Error/Goof''': // OR board inconsistency\u this birth date would imply Izzie is not yet twenty-eight by the time of George's death in [[Good Mourning]], x.</ref>, set on '''June ''' or '''June ''', . Yet \"[[Break on Through]]\" confirms she is already at least , and ''at least'' over one year and several months have passed, by the time of \"[[Good Mourning]]\" (x) (set before this would-be birthday timeframe). Therefore, it is certain the OR board date of birth, a brief visual cameo, was an error by production.

She knew she didn't have Covid, she said, because she hadn't gone anywhere or seen anyone. Jo told her in the ER that her abdominal pain was due to pregnancy, so she was moved into a room. Carina did an ultrasound, which showed an empty uterus, so they started looking for other causes for the positive pregnancy test. They did a CT, which showed a fetus growing near her liver. She was told she was about  weeks along. Carina asked her if she wanted the baby. When she said she did, they told her her baby would need to be delivered right away, as waiting carried the risk of catastrophic bleeding from her liver. They took her into surgery, where Carina did a C-section. Her baby, whom she named Luna, was intubated and then taken to the NICU. Val's liver started bleeding, forcing them to remove one of the lobes, putting Val at risk for liver failure, but stopping the bleeding. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nVal was still in the hospital after her partial liver resection. She had concerned labs, so Jo ordered a CT, which showed a pseudoaneurysm, which required surgery. Val was upset with having to see her daughter only on a phone screen, but Jo explained that neither of them was stable enough to visit the other. Val begged Jo to help make parenthood real for her. After Val's surgery, Jo suspected she might still end up needing a transplant since they'd had to remove so much of her liver. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nTwo days after her surgery, Val was severely jaundiced and septic. She struggled with not being able to see Luna, worried that she was scared and alone. She tried to convince Jo that she was healthy enough to go see Luna, but Jo knew she was lying. Jo ordered a CT and labs, which showed that her liver was failing, so she ordered liver dialysis. Despite this, Val later coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe is divorced. She and her ex-husband tried conceiving for eight years, including six rounds of IVF. He blamed her for every failed cycle, asking what she should have done differently. They grew to hate each other and so divorced. She then had a one-night stand with a man who rented their back room and became pregnant, leading her to understand that it was never her fault.\n\n\nHer daughter, Luna, was born at  weeks' gestation after growing on her liver instead of in her uterus. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")'' Shortly after Luna's birth, Val contacted Newman and told him about her. He wished her luck, but signed over his parental rights, leaving Val as Luna's sole parent.

At the end of the night, Susan and Meredith said a happy goodbye. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\nAfter the dinner, Susan began to bring Meredith groceries. Susan also said she'd like to sit down with Meredith and talk and get to know her better, but Meredith rejected her, telling her to stop.

She was the youngest of five siblings, but was always the mother when they played.\n\nWhen she grew up, she married Jonathan and they immediately tried to have children. She had her first miscarriage six months into their marriage and had one per year until they finally got to the second trimester. Then she had a placental abruption and had to have an emergency hysterectomy and the fetus did not survive. Jonathan was then diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma and died, but before he died, he froze his sperm, giving Tovah the hope that she'd eventually bring his child into the world and realize her dream of being a mother.\n\nOver two years later, Tovah was prepared to have a uterine transplant to aid her journey to motherhood. Since she had family in Seattle to help her during her recovery, Addison asked to do her surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial. As Addison operated, the HVAC system at the hospital went out, forcing her to call in Meredith to rush the surgery. After the placed the graft, there was no blood flow, forcing them to detach it to dislodge a clot. Despite this complication, the surgery was a success and Tovah was stable after her surgery. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her transplant surgery, Tovah began having seizures. Addison administered lorazepam and phenobarbital to treat the seizures with no effect. In order to preserve brain function, Addison put her into an induced coma in order to consult with a neurosurgeon for further treatment options. After her CT and labs were evaluated, Amelia ordered an MRI, an EEG, and additional panel-testing to determine her electrolyte and immunosuppressant levels. Because the testing revealed no neurological causes for the seizures, Amelia recommended an increase of anticonvulsants and switching immunosuppressants to combat the likely cause of neurotoxicity from the anti-rejection medication due to the uterine transplant. Addison agreed, and the new treatment plan proved successful. She woke up with the uterine transplant intact and still qualifying for Addison's trial. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nSeveral months later, Tovah was pregnant in her transplanted uterus. The pregnancy was her final embryo made from her husband's sperm. When she was eleven weeks, she reported abdominal pain, so Addison came to Seattle to check on her. Addison found that she had restricted blood flow to both sides of the uterus. An MR angio showed the right side was completely clotted off while the left side was clotted, but salvageable, so they took her into surgery to clear the blockage and try to save the graft and the pregnancy. In surgery, they discovered there was no blood flow to the left side. Addison prepared to remove the graft and pregnancy, but Meredith suggested a vascular revision to restore blood flow. It worked, but by that point, there was not fetal heartbeat. Addison did a D&C. When Addison told Tovah what had happened, she also told her the graft was still viable and she could try again, just not with her husband's sperm. Levi, seeing her grief, offered to recite the mourner's Kaddish with her. She cried as they did so. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to Jonathan until his death. They were both one of five children.\n\n\nShe is the youngest of five siblings. Her family lives in Seattle. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")'' Her sisters begged her not to participate in Addison's trial because they didn't want to lose her.

He is married to [[Miranda Bailey]]. Ben was previously a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and was initially an [[Attending|attending]] [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] prior to changing his career to surgery, and later to a firefighter.\n\n\n\nBen grew into an adrenalin-chasing teenager. One day, he went on a joyride with his friends Michael and Danny with the latter's father's car. While out driving, Michael asked Danny to let him ride for once. Danny was hesitant but Ben dared him to allow it, which lead to Danny giving in. While Michael was speeding, Danny stood up in the backseat to experience that feeling that the other two had described as amazing. Out of nowhere, a deer crossed the road right in front of them. The car swerved and slammed into a tree. Danny was thrown out and Ben and Michael found him unconscious with an open skull fracture. Michael drove him to the hospital while Ben tried to get him to wake up in the backseat. Danny ended up in a persistent vegetative state. Guilt-ridden, Ben sat by Danny's beside for days until Danny's mother told him that she hoped that this accident had made him start thinking about his actions and that he would never do anything to make his mother go through what she was going through now.<ref>[[Indoor Fireworks]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAs a result, Ben changed himself to get rid of his adrenalin-chasing habits and learned to like crosswords. He got into med school and ended up choosing anesthesiology so he would be able to wake people up, unlike Danny.\n\n\nBen initially was an attending anesthesiologist at [[Mercy West Medical Center]] and transferred to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital when the two hospitals merged. During a surgery performed by [[Meredith Grey]] and [[Miranda Bailey]], [[Leslie Wilson|the patient]] woke up on the table and Bailey yelled at Ben to put her back under. Bailey put all the blame on Ben and said that at Seattle Grace, they could always trust the \"gas man\" to keep the patients under while the surgeons did the real work. He set out to investigate and discovered she had a condition that caused her to metabolize the anesthetics more rapidly than normal, which is why she woke up. He found Bailey and asked for an apology, though he let that go when he noticed how rattled Bailey was about the patient refusing to let Bailey touch her again. Leslie had be operated on again as she had a rebleed so Meredith took over from Bailey. During the surgery, Ben knew how to properly keep her under. He brought up Bailey's speech about anesthesiologists being lazy and she told him that she yells at people when she gets scared, which was the closest he'd get to an apology.<ref>[[State of Love and Trust]], x</ref>\n\nBen became interested in Bailey and asked her out to dinner on Valentine's Day to make up for the fact that one of their surgeries was pushed because of a massive trauma. She told him she was too busy with surgery. Callie and Arizona got involved playing Cupid and they got Ben re-assigned to Bailey's new surgery. Arizona joined them in the OR and steered the conversation towards dating. She told Ben that Bailey had almost become a pediatric surgeon until she changed her mind, hinting that Bailey could be persuaded to change her mind about the date. After surgery, Ben congratulated Bailey on her saving the patient. She then told him she didn't want to talk to him because she liked him and his being around her made her go stupid. However, she did agree to go out to dinner with him the next day.<ref>[[Valentine's Day Massacre]], x</ref> The first date went well. A few days later, he found her preparing for a speech at lecture day. He complimented her and although she told him to go away, she enjoyed being flattered.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, he told her she was having dinner with him that night for their third date. She had a yoga class scheduled but he convinced her to let that go. Callie got into her head about the third date meaning sex, so while at his apartment, she started lecturing him about her not doing things on a timeline. He interrupted her lecture and said lecturing wouldn't work on him because he wasn't too scared to interrupt her like the people at work. He told her they would have a nice dinner with conversation and swore that he didn't expect sex, because he, too, found the third date early for that. She confessed she hadn't had sex with anyone other than her ex-husband. He didn't mind and appreciated that she, like him, didn't get into that too fast. She asked him what he thought was the right time. While he thought they would know when they were there, he suspected somewhere between date  and . She cautiously asked if he was afraid they'd end up just being friends. He was confident that wouldn't happen since none of them started this looking for friends. He then kissed her and they had a nice evening.<ref>[[Push]], x</ref>\n\nThey continued to date for months. While back at his apartment, she started lecturing him about what he couldn't do to her at the hospital in order to keep her personal and professional lives separated. He got undressed in front of her and told her she could either lecture him or let him take her to his bedroom. She chose the second option. The next day, Mark and Derek found out because of the two of them were humming the same song on the elevator. Bailey later caught Ben flirting with a nurse and spent the day being cold towards him. He found her at the end of the day and told her that he flirted with Liz so she would do him little favors, which made his job more fun. Also, he brought his lazy flirting for Liz so he could save the good flirting for Bailey. She told him she was going through a tough divorce and didn't have time for games. He assured her he was in it for real and they left the hospital holding hands.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the shooting at the hospital, Ben was out playing golf with his phone turned off, so he didn't find out about the shooting until after it was over. Bailey was heavily traumatized from her experience and packed up to go visit her mother with her son. Ben came by her house and found her getting into a cab. She ignored his question about when she'd be back and left. She returned after a month. He tried to talk to her after her work day and she told him that while he was a perfect man, she was too busy holding herself together with tape and glue to be with him now. Since he missed the shooting, he couldn't understand what she was going through and that made it too much for her to be with him. He understood and told her to take care of herself.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\n\nFor the rest of the year, Ben stayed out of Bailey's way by bringing a guy named Pierre coffees so he wouldn't assign Ben to Bailey's surgeries.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\nAt one point, [[Eli Lloyd|nurse Eli]] and Ben got into a conflict because Eli yelled at one of Ben's residents for messing up a routine epidural. Derek broke up the fight and told Ben that they should fight over Bailey on his own time but Ben didn't even know Bailey was dating Eli. In surgery, Ben told Derek the news had upset him so much that he couldn't concentrate during a meeting. Derek then invited him to take out his anger by helping him build the deck at his house. While doing that, Ben vented his anger to Owen about Bailey blowing him off over not being ready for a relationship only to start dating Eli months later. The next day, Ben saw Eli and Bailey together with Tuck. He and Derek agreed they looked happy so Ben let them be. He came out to Derek's deck to blow off steam again in the evening.<ref>[[What is It About Men]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Ben decided he wouldn't avoid her anymore and they soon ended up on the same surgery again. He approached her and asked her if that would be a problem. She said no. He was happy to hear that because he was done paying off Pierre with lattes if she was now being held together by a male nurse rather than tape and glue. After the surgery, Ben couldn't fully hide his anger about her sleeping with Eli after she basically told him to wait for her. Bailey said a relationship like they had was too much for her to handle and added that what she was doing with Eli was nothing like what they had. Ben asked her what she was doing with Eli then but she ignored the question and told him to take it up with Pierre if he had a problem working with her. After work, Ben shortly greeted Bailey as he walked past her on his way to his car. She came after him and told him he would soon hear things about her breaking up with Eli. She wanted to clarify that that didn't have anything to do with him. He saw right through her lie and smiled as he said he'd see her tomorrow.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, Ben ended up in Bailey's OR again. He had heard about [[Henry Burton]] dying and brought that up, but she snapped that she'd rather talk about her living patients. Ben diagnosed malignant hyperthermia when Bailey's patient on the table started to deteriorate. He acted quickly to get the patient to cool down, which saved the kid's life. Bailey and Ben waited for the patient's temperature to decline sufficiently for the procedure to continue, during which Bailey complimented Ben's quick diagnosis. Afterward, they ended up in an empty cafeteria and she apologized for being rude to him when he mentioned Henry earlier. He was already used to her lashing out, which is what she does when bad things happen to her. It meant she needed space, which is why he sat down at a different table. She said she didn't just lose a patient, she lost a friend. He was sorry to hear that. She then told him she wouldn't mind if he didn't give her quite so much space, after which he moved to her table and held her hand while he finished his crossword puzzle.<ref>[[Suddenly]], x</ref>\n\nThey started their relationship again and after two weeks, Ben asked her to move in. She didn't give him an answer so he maneuvered himself onto her surgery so he could talk to her about it. Bailey recruited Meredith to flood her with questions so she could teach instead of talking to Ben about moving in. Ben saw through that trick and steered the conversation towards living together, citing Meredith and Derek as an example. Bailey pointed out that Meredith's tampering with Derek's trial nearly destroyed both her professional and personal life, which got her to admit that she wanted to keep her personal and professional lives separated. Ben commented he would just like for her to be the first thing he would see in the morning and then let it go. When Meredith left for lunch, Bailey told Ben that she didn't want to complicate what they had by rushing it. He told her his life was happening right now and that he wanted to share all of it with her, every day. If she didn't want that, he thought they weren't right for each other. She still didn't agree, which he took as his answer. After the break, Ben again pointed out Meredith had a perfect balance between her professional and personal life. The patient made it through and Ben joked they could go have a drink to celebrate if only she were to let joy into her life. She snapped and said she wanted to focus at work in order not to make mistakes. After the surgery, Bailey told Ben her whole life fell apart when she got divorced and she had worked hard to get back on her feet. She was scared of her relationship with him blowing up again, which would cause her to get knocked off her feet again. He said they could be scared together in the same house and take it one step at a time, starting with her bringing her toothbrush over. She reminded him she had a son. Ben liked him and assured her that he wanted the whole package. She then agreed to take it one step at a time.<ref>[[This Magic Moment]], x</ref>\n\nBen set up an elegant dinner for her them on Valentine's Day. That morning, he checked if they were still on for tonight as she had a habit of cancelling for a surgery. She told him she had rearranged her entire schedule to be out on time and even brought heels in the back of her car. However, she got drawn in when her patient was found to have a second tumor in a yet-to-be-discovered location. She had Ben push the reservation to  PM but by the time she made it out of the OR, it was :. She ran into Ben, not having realized the time until then, and apologized for ruining their Valentine's Day. She started a lecture about how he couldn't fault her for saving lives. She then noticed he was in a suit. He told her Valentine's Day wasn't over yet and took her to the cafeteria, where he had set up a romantic dinner for the two of them. He had been planning it for weeks as he knew they would never make their reservation. He told her he was very good at romance. She agreed and they shared a toast.<ref>[[All You Need is Love]], x</ref>\n\nAfter working on opposite schedules for weeks, Ben and Bailey agreed to watch a game together, though Ben hadn't planned on actually watching the game since Tuck was at his father's. However, Bailey had to cancel because Callie and Arizona asked her to come to girls' night to cheer up Teddy after Henry's death and her falling out with Owen. Bailey initially wanted to ditch the women for her evening with Ben but she showed up anyway.<ref>[[Support System]], x</ref>\n\n\nBen got offered an internship at UCLA. He accepted and moved to Los Angeles to start. At the beginning, Ben and Bailey weren't sure it would work out, but both Miranda and Ben kept their relationship alive only seeing each other every now and then.\n\n\nBen quit his job at UCLA because he felt he never saw Miranda or his stepson, so he came back and surprised her, saying he quit his job. Miranda was not so thrilled right away because she did approve of him giving up surgery, but, it was later revealed that he did not want to give up surgery and he became a surgical resident again at GSM.\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of whom had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Ben opened up a man in the psych ward and operated on a pregnant lady without proper consent and surgical equipment, he was put on probation for  months. He attained privileges as an attending anesthesiologist during his probation.\n\n\nBen was one of the many doctors who helped evacuate patients amidst the hospital explosion. When asked about [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie Edwards']] whereabouts, he recalled seeing her before the explosion and led a team of firefighters inside the actively burning hospital to find her. After searching, he found a trace of blood on the stairs leading up to the roof of the hospital, where they were able to locate and save Stephanie and [[Erin Miller|Erin]].\n\n\nBen claimed he was happy with surgery but wanted something more. Later he admited to Miranda that he had been accepted into the Seattle Fire Academy. Miranda was not amused but later supported Ben in his decision.\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. Having extinguished the fire, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean and Ben responded to an Aid call at The Langham. They found [[JJ Lau|JJ]] on her floor after she fell off a ladder. Her smoke alarm was still going off, so Dean broke through the ceiling and released smoke into the apartment. He picked up JJ and carried her out of her apartment.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop. They later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital. At the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she had developed a fear of fire since the tanker incident. The team decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. After the fire burned itself out, Ben was put on cleanup.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over. Afterward, Ben was interviewed by Ripley as part of the process to decide who would be captain of Station . He asked Ben about the situation with Peter and the party bus crash. At the end of Ben's explanation, Ripley applauded Ben's honesty in the situation.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. Outside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount. The trapped were freed when they used the water heater to cause an explosion and compromise the door just enough to give them access.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen came into work one day and learned that he'd reached an important milestone. He'd walked into and out of fifty fires. He was given a key to the aid car and permission to drive it. Station  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. Ben and Travis treated patients with minor burns at triage and sent them out. When Jack and Dean found combustibles on a floor above the fire, a rapid evacuation was started. In order to release the civilians from the top floor, Ripley sent Ben and Travis to clear the black smoke out of the stairwells so they could walk down. They did so, but when the fire jumped floors and broke out the window, Travis became impaled on a shard of glass. With the radios not working, Ben dragged Travis down the stairs. On the stairs, they ran into Molly, who had been trampled by a panicked mob. Her lung was collapsed. Travis told Ben to take Molly downstairs and save the life he could save. Then there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen dragged Molly down the stairs toward the bottom. She suddenly started struggling to breathe even more than before, so Ben put her down. He then used the needle from the EpiPen in her first aid kit to re-inflate her lung. He then started to carry her down the stairs to keep the needle stable. Once she was outside, he put her on a gurney and took her to the aid car and took her to the hospital. He handed her off to Bailey, who took her into surgery. Travis arrived with Vic and Dean moments later, but when he asked about Travis, Vic angrily brushed him off. They all went to the waiting room to see how Molly and Travis would come out. When [[Grant (Station )|Grant]] arrived, he was also upset to learn that Ben had left Travis alone. They continued to wait and were told that Travis's repair would be extremely difficult. Ben also learned that Molly didn't survive her surgery, which upset him. In the end, Travis pulled through and spent the next several weeks recovering.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away by the water. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis, Dean, and Ben responded to the call when [[Hannah Sherwood]] got her hand caught in her garbage disposal. She'd reached down there when her wedding ring had fallen in and got her hand caught. She turned it off quickly, but then decided to wait for help instead of trying to pull her hand out. Travis said he'd disconnect it and then take it apart to release her hand. While they were work, Hannah noticed that her daughter had gotten a tattoo and asked one of them to check it out to see if it was infected. Dean did and put antibiotic ointment on it. Travis was finally able to free Hannah's hand and they told her to follow up with the hospital in a few days.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor. At the party, Ben told Dean he was happy to be home with his wife, and prepared to make changes to keep her happy, which may include quitting firefighting.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter months of rehab, Sullivan was finally ready to go back to work. He met with Pruitt, who had acted as interim captain, and received reports from Pruitt. Pruitt criticized him for missing Jack's PTSD and not seeing that regular drop-ins weren't coming in anymore. This inspired Sullivan to take Ben and Jack for a wellness check on a drop-in Pruitt specifically mentioned. They went to his house and did an exam. He revealed that Sullivan was the reason he stopped checking in. His car was busted, leaving him unable to pick up his medications. Ben then heard regurgitation in his heart. He didn't want to go to the hospital, but he collapsed trying to fight them off. Sullivan distracted him with a game of chess as they worked to get him stable while they waited for an aid car. He stabilized, then checkmated Sullivan. After they sent him to the hospital, they remembered that he mentioned his car wasn't working, so they went to his garage and fixed it.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen, Dean, and Travis had planned to work together to repaint Travis's place. As they prepared to leave, Sullivan talked his way into an invitation to join them. With Sullivan there, they painted in virtual silence. When Sullivan started dancing while painting, they were disturbed, but he explained that when a month ago, you couldn't move your legs, you dance when a song comes on that makes you want to dance. The rest of them started to dance as well.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. While they worked on her, Andy took Ellie to the conference room to talk to her and keep her calm. As her mom was ready to be moved, she said she didn't want to go to the hospital with her because she felt she was always messing things up. Shortly afterward, she collapsed from low blood sugar. She was given glucose and quickly woke up, but still worried about her mom having another seizure and her not being able to help. Andy then sent Ellie to the hospital to be with her mom, while they dealt with the damage to the station caused by the crash and subsequent explosion.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen Ripley passed out on a sidewalk and was taken to the hospital, Sullivan, Ben, and Andy came to the hospital to check on his condition. Andy and Ben were surprised to learn that he'd been buying flowers for Vic when he passed out. After being banished from his room, they waited in the hospital waiting area. They were shocked when his lab results came back, showing his condition was much worse than previously believed and he had fled the hospital in search of Vic.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter reuniting with Bailey, he decided he wanted to try something that would be less stressful for her and thought it might be time to move on from being a firefighter.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref> When Pruitt heard about this, he suggested that Ben try out for Medic One, an elite paramedic team.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> Despite his medical training, Ben wasn't sure he'd be good enough to make it.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nBailey unexpectedly became pregnant, but then sadly lost the pregnancy.\n\n\nAfter months of quarantining mostly separately, Ben and Bailey finally got some alone time when [[Rosalind Warren|Roz]] took the boys out for a hike. They had sex and while cuddling afterward, Bailey felt a mass in Ben's testicle. She demanded they go see a urologist right away. Since he refused to go to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], she did some research and got them an appointment at [[Clark Kabir|Kabir Urology Clinic]]. Based on the labs and ultrasound, Dr. Kabir strongly suspected a mixed germ cell tumor, for which Ben's job put him at an increased risk. He proposed to perform an orchiectomy and analyze the tissue afterward rather than a biopsy, since that type of tumor could quickly metastasize. On the drive home, Ben revealed he wasn't sure what to tell the boys. Bailey was firm about telling them the truth, which would show them it is okay to be vulnerable. Ben confessed he wasn't ready to have the surgery yet, but Bailey reminded him of the mortality rate for Black men with cancer and said she couldn't handle any more loss after the year she had had. After his conversation with the boys, Joey joined him in the kitchen and asked him questions about the procedure. Ben picked up on his interest in medicine and said he and Bailey would help cover the cost if he were to decide to go to med school, much to Joey's delight.<ref>[[I Guess I'm Floating]], x (S)</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, news about George Floyd's death spread across the country. Ben found out on his phone at the station and joined his crew-mates in the lounge as they watched the news report on television in horror. Maya brought in [[Diane Lewis]] to grief counsel her team. Ben was the first to seek her out and opened up his fears as a Black man in America and the struggles of raising Black sons in the current political climate.\n\nBen along with Dean, Vic, and Robert attended the annual Black Firefighters Coalition where [[Battalion Chief Gregory]] gave a speech about working his way up to create lasting equity from within. Ben and Vic criticized him for being all talk and no actual change. Later, Ben witnessed how Dean jumped into the ocean after Gregory, who had fallen over the railing after clutching his chest. Ben grabbed a life vest and throw ring and jumped after Dean. Together, they tried to perform CPR on Gregory to no avail while the boat sailed off into the distance. Ben concluded there was nothing they could do for Gregory anymore. They realized they had drifted about a mile from where they had gone overboard, meaning they would be hard to find, and neither of them had a working phone on them to contact people on the boat. Dean refused to let go of Gregory's corpse and they floated around aimlessly waiting for help to arrive. As they drifted around, Ben urged Dean to fight so he could push through with his lawsuit and make the world a better place for Pru. He then revealed his cancer diagnosis and Dean found he was hesitant to have the surgery, which he called Ben out for. Dean freaked about dying again, which would mean that he would die without telling the one woman he wanted to be Pru's mother how he felt about her. Ben was shocked to find out he was in love with Vic. They held hands to float together like sea otters do. As the hypothermia set in, Dean asked Ben to raise Pru with Bailey if he were to die. Ben agreed to do so and reminded Dean that he was not alone in anything, that his village was also Dean's and that they would always support him and fight his fight alongside him. A boat then approached but it sailed past them without noticing them. The waves it created forced Dean to let go of Gregory's body, after which Ben helped Dean to stay afloat. Ben then envisioned Joey graduating from med school and thanking Ben, who couldn't be there but without whom he could never have done it. As they watched a plane fly over, Dean reminded Ben of their deal and said he couldn't use his legs anymore, which Ben attributed to the hypothermia. Dean was glad Ben had jumped into the water after him, even though it was stupid, so he didn't have to do this alone. He then said he needed to let go of Ben to give him a chance to survive. The two of them then finally passed out. Their bodies washed ashore, where the coast guard found them. Vic, Sullivan, and Bailey arrived at the scene just as the two men regained consciousness. As they were carried to the aid cars, they held hands.<ref>[[I Guess I'm Floating]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nHe initially clashed with Bailey when their patient woke up on the table while Bailey was operating, which she blamed him for. He later came to Bailey with medical proof and said that it wasn't his fault that the patient woke up. In the second surgery, Bailey said that when she is scared she yells, and that is why she was so mad at him. Ben thought of it as an apology and accepted it.\n\nThey dated for nine months, but after the shooting, Bailey broke up with him, saying she needed to put herself back together. They started dating again after [[Eli Lloyd]] broke things off with her because he was well aware she still loved her ex. They later got engaged and eventually were supposed to get married, but on the way to the wedding Adele Webber was rushed to the ER, and Miranda and Richard went to the hospital. Later they got married. They honeymooned in the Bahamas.\n\nDuring a day off, Miranda told Ben she needed to talk to him. She told him about how even with stepping down temporarily as Chief and changing her diet and exercise, her blood pressure was still too high. She asked him for a sabbatical from their marriage, saying she needed time to get her health in order. He left their home after giving her a last kiss.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter getting back in check with her mental health, Bailey went to Ben and told him that she realized it was her mental health that was the problem, not her physical and she wanted him to come home. He said that she had hurt him really bad, but eventually, he forgave her and showed her this by starting to build the treehouse he promised her after her heart attack. They agreed that they were in it together.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Rosalind Warren]]\nBen was very close to his brother growing up. They shared rooms for most of their lives, even into adulthood. The relationship was strained when Rosalind came out as transgender. Ben didn't really mind that his brother would soon be his sister and accepted her, but he hated the fact that she had kept it from him all those years while they shared basically everything else.\n\n\nDr. Ben Warren was a fifth-year [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] before he decided to be a firefighter at [[SFD Station ]].\n\nHe originally worked as an [[Attending|attending]] [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] at [[Mercy West Medical Center]] prior to the merger with [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. He kept his position as an attending anesthesiologist when he transferred to the merged [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. During his tenure at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Dr. Warren was the anesthesiologist on most of [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey's]] surgical cases and a few on [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd's]] cases. He also supervised [[Resident|anesthesiology residents]].\n\nAfter the events of the hospital shooting, Dr. Warren considered a [[Specialties|specialty]] change into [[Surgery|surgery]] and applied to [[UCLA Medical Center|UCLA's]] [[General Surgery|surgical program]]. At the end of the [[Timeline#Grey's Anatomy Season |- residency year]], Dr. Warren was accepted and soon after, relocated to Los Angeles and began his surgical career as an [[Internship|intern]]. Throughout his intern year, Dr. Warren commuted between Los Angeles and Seattle to spend time with his [[Miranda Bailey|wife]] and [[William George Bailey Jones|step-son]]. During his visits, he was granted privileges at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] by [[Chief of Surgery]] [[Owen Hunt]] and acted as a [[Attending|consulting]] anesthesiologist.\n\nDuring his second-year, Dr. Warren resigned UCLA's [[Resident|surgical residency program]] to move back to Seattle and be closer to his family. He then returned to his former position on the staff as an attending anesthesiologist at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. However, he missed surgery so much that he decided to continue his residency at Grey Sloan Memorial, taking [[Heather Brooks|Heather Brooks']] place in the program.\n\nHe took an interest in [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]] with [[Jackson Avery]] as his mentor, unwillingly forming the new Plastics Posse. However, when he was on Arizona's service due to Richard's switching around, she noticed his talent and requested him on her service.\n\nDuring his fourth year, Dr. Warren was suspended for six months from the surgical residency program by the chief of surgery. His suspension was due to performing unsupervised surgery beyond his scope of authority exacerbated by a perceived error in judgment leading to the death of two patients. He practiced his former specialty of anesthesiology while being suspended. His suspension was lifted by Bailey after he saved April and her daughter.\n\nNearing the end of his fourth year, Ben decided to apply for the Fire Training Academy and started working out every chance he could get. He was accepted and enrolled in the Medic One Program to become a qualified EMT, a requirement for Seattle firefighters. The Medic One Program allowed for his career change to be branded a fellowship in order not to completely disrupt his career as a surgeon, allowing him to return to the hospital at any moment if he sees fit. As part of the Program, Ben did ride-alongs with paramedics.\n\n\n*During [[What is It About Men]], [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] asks Ben about his time as a fifth-year [[Resident|resident]]. This is an error as the [[Resident|residency program]] for [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiology]] is only four years.\n*While a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at UCLA, Dr. Warren retained privileges as an [[Attending|attending]] [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] whenever he visited Seattle.\n*Ben appears to make it a point to try and stay out of his colleagues' personal lives.\n*He has a self-proclaimed impressive running whip stitch technique.\n*His family is \"all about Halloween.\"<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n*He snores and occasionally talks in his sleep.<ref>[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]], x</ref>\n*He had a crush on Thalia Hall in th grade.<ref>[[The Great Pretender]], x</ref>\n*He was the first prominent anesthesiologist in Grey's Anatomy.\n*When he was a surgical resident, the other residents made fun of him for being older than most residents.\n*Before [[Carina DeLuca|Carina]] joined the main cast of Station-, Ben was the only doctor to be the main cast.\n*He had a fear of fires. After going inside a burning building to locate and save [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] and [[Erin Miller|Erin]], he got over his fear and became a firefighter.\n*When he was a surgical resident, his lab coat had Ben Warren embroidered on it, while his official name is Benjamin. Other characters with shortened names, such as Jo and Callie, have their official name embroidered on their lab coats.\n**This is also the case with [[Lexie Grey|Lexie Grey's]] lab coat and later [[Tom Koracick|Tom Koracick's]].\n*Ben is one of the handful of characters that has a [[Specialties|dual-specialty]]: [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiology]] and [[General Surgery|general surgery]].

She blamed her pregnancy for leaving the car in drive. His shoulder was dislocated and he had burns from the road. His injuries were treated in surgery. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital with Rob, Jen collapsed. She had a normal neuro exam, but her blood pressure was elevated, so they struggled to get it back down before it started affecting the baby. Her husband told the doctors that eating calms her down and she likes cheeseburgers, so they got her one to try to keep her blood pressure down. Jen started panicking again when Lexie said that Rob's surgery was taking longer than expected, but after Lexie's calmed her, it went way down and Jen had a seizure. An MRI then revealed an aneurysm, for which they scheduled surgery. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\nHer surgery was scheduled for the next morning, but it was pushed back so he could treat [[Archer Montgomery]]. Jen became increasingly nervous as she waited for her surgery. [[Alex Karev]] tried to calm her down by showing her her son's face and having her focus on that. At the end of the day, Derek told her her surgery was scheduled for the first thing the next morning. She begged him not to make her wait another night, so he took her into surgery that night. In surgery, there was unexpected bleeding, but they were able to stop it and Derek clipped the aneurysm. Shortly after her surgery, Jen became unstable again and Derek was called back to the hospital. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\nWhen he arrived back at the hospital, he found Jen with difficulty breathing. He then consulted with Addison on the case. Addison suggested that the baby could be the problem. They did a doppler and found that the baby was anemic and Jen was mirroring. After running more tests, which showed that the baby was in heart failure, Addison said it was likely due to the blood Jen had gotten during her first surgery being incompatible with the baby. Addison said ideally, she'd do an in utero blood transfusion, but this wasn't ideal. She instead suggested delivering the baby to save Jen's life. Jen declined and said she wanted to wait two weeks to give him a better chance. They asked for another option, so Derek mentioned the transfusion, despite Addison saying it was too risky. Jen insisted that she wanted it. Addison did the transfusion successfully. ''(\"[[Ex-Life]]\")''\n\n\nJen was stable after her surgery, but unable to speak clearly due to blood flow issues, Derek stayed by her bedside for several hours, guilty for having nicked the aneurysm in her first surgery. Derek took her into surgery for a EC-IC Bypass to stop the mini-strokes she was having. Addison came into the surgery to monitor the baby throughout. In surgery, Jen and the baby became unstable. Addison wanted to deliver the baby, but Derek asked her to wait. He stabilized Jen just before she made the incision to deliver. After her surgery, the aphasia had cleared, but she had developed pre-eclampsia. Later, her patch blew and she had to be taken back into surgery. Derek made the radical decision to remove her temporal lobe. When the bleeding spread into her frontal lobe, he decided to remove that as well. Addison objected and eventually had to call in [[Richard Webber|The Chief]] to get Derek to back down and allow Addison to deliver the baby. Addison did the c-section and Jen was pronounced dead shortly after. ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\n\nDerek was later deposed for a lawsuit because of Jen's death. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to [[Rob Harmon]] until her death. He proposed to her in a supermarket aisle because that's the first place he saw her. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\nJen loved her husband very much, she felt guilty for running him over with their car.\n\n\nIn her final surgery, her son was delivered. Because of the steroids and the three additional days that had passed, they believed he had a good chance to survive.

During her surgery, the hospital technology started to malfunction. After the power went out for a moment, [[Meredith Grey]] decided to convert to an open surgery. She called for blood, which [[Levi Schmitt]] was unable to get due to the hack. Desperate, Meredith asked the OR staff if anyone had the right blood type. Levi was the only one to volunteer, so he was hooked to Judy to give a direct transfusion. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nJudy's surgery continued, with Levi's blood transfusing into her. He became faint from blood loss and collapsed to the floor, so [[Paul Stadler]] stepped in to help operate on her.

When his friends showed up before his surgery, because they decided to take an earlier flight, he drove them off and yelled at them to get out of his room, turning the injured half of his face away from them. The doctors convinced him to let them come back, mostly because Mark told him that he would not be able to undergo a major surgery such as a facial transplant without people to care for him after he came out of surgery. He explained to his friends that he didn't want them to see him like this, because he thought himself ugly, but one of his friends, [[Shayna]], gently kissed the top of his forehead and said to him, \"Do not call my dear friend ugly,\" establishing that she wanted to be his friend, no matter what he looked like.\n\nHis surgery went well and afterward, they were able to get a sneak preview of it. Even though there was swelling, he was pleased with the outcome.\n\n\n\nDavid, [[Shayna]], [[Milo]], and [[Dexter]] all met on a message board for orchid lovers.

After Denny's donor died, Burke fought over Michael's donor's heart. After calling UNOS, they confirmed that Michael was higher on the list than Denny by a very small margin, but being entered into the list  seconds earlier gave him the edge. After Izzie found this out, she lied and said that Denny was getting worse, hoping to move his status up so he'd get the heart.

She is married to [[Owen Hunt]], whom she met in the military. They are raising their daughter [[Allison Hunt]] and son [[Leo Hunt]] together. She is the widow of [[Henry Burton]] and a mentor to [[Cristina Yang]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n\n\nNot much is known about Teddy's childhood prior to her medical education. Teddy attended med school at [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School]] and completed her [[Resident|residency]] in [[General Surgery]] at the [[George Washington University Medical Center]] and a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] at the [[Mayo Clinic]].\n\n\nShortly after graduating, she took a job at [[Columbia University Medical Center]]. During her first year as an attending, [[Allison Robin Brown]] almost rode her bike into her as Teddy was crossing the street and stopped on the bike lane to look at her map. Given the stress she was under at her job, she lashed out and yelled at Allison. Despite hating her, Allison bought her a bagel to apologize, which got Teddy to calm down. They then got to talking and instantly liked one another. Soon after, Teddy moved in with Allison and her cardiovascular surgeon girlfriend [[Claire (Love of My Life)|Claire]]. \n[[File:xTeddyMotherDeath.png|thumb|px|Teddy learns of her mother's death.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy and Allison have an affair.]]\nIn late  and early , Teddy lost her father and mother, respectively. Around that time, she developed an affair with Allison behind Claire's back, taking advantage of every time Claire was paged to the hospital.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy and Claire find out Allison died.]]\n\nOn the eve of September , , Allison lied about having an early lay-out meeting the next day. Claire was then paged to the hospital. After she had left, Allison invited Teddy to have breakfast at Windows on the World together. They ended up having sex again. Allison had her tell the story of how they met. Teddy said she couldn't keep sneaking around and lying to their best friend. Allison then decided to tell Claire tomorrow because she loved Teddy more than she did Claire. However, the next day, on /, Allison died in the second tower. Teddy learned the news while working at the hospital, where she and Claire comforted one another as they realized Allison was gone. Unable to live in New York without Allison and having decided to keep the affair a secret, Teddy enlisted for the Army even though she had mostly been a socialist up until then. On some level, she wanted to support the soldiers that were out there getting revenge for Allison's death.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nShe went to Afghanistan, where she met [[Owen Hunt]], who saved her from a grief so huge she probably would have let it kill her. While she found him buttoned-up and couldn't stand his optimism, she was in awe of his brilliance and decisiveness. He didn't tell her how to grieve or try and fix her. They became best friends and she fell in love with him. She felt guilty for loving him half as much as Allison, guilty because he was with someone else, and guilty because she wasn't capable of letting someone love her fully. While Allison loved her, she also loved Claire. At the time, she thought love couldn't be divided between two people.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref><ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nBy , Teddy was working in Iraq with\ua[[Owen Hunt]],\ua[[Nathan Riggs]], and\ua[[Megan Hunt]]. They were all friends while Teddy was secretly in love with Owen, even though he was engaged to [[Beth Whitman]]. While Megan was also dismissive of her brother's relationship, Teddy kept her feelings a secret because she couldn't bear the thought of possibly losing him on top of all the other losses she had had to endure.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x; [[Everyday Angel]], x</ref> [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy works on a wounded soldier.]]\n\nUpon finding out about Nathan and Megan's engagement, Teddy was immediately suspicious because she recognized the necklace Nathan had used to propose as belonging to Felicia Phillips. The doctors were called out to treat several wounded soldiers after two of their Iraqi allies went rogue. As she and Nathan operated on a soldier, Teddy confronted him about her suspicions and he admitted he had cheated on Megan. She advised him to tell Megan as she would probably forgive him, noting that their love was strong. She then went to confront Owen after Megan told her that he had tanked her stratification ranking, leading Teddy to rant about how terrible it was to have to stand by and watch people live the life that you want, hinting at her jealousy over Owen and Beth's relationship. Later that evening, Teddy's patient told her that Megan's patient was the second shooter, while the doctors had previously been told that said woman was trying to wrestle the gun out of the supposed second shooter's hand. Teddy then rushed out of the tent to stop Megan from leaving with the woman on an evacuation helicopter, but she came too late and could only watch the helicopter fly off.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Megan was kidnapped by her patient. Megan's disappearance drove a wedge between Nathan and Owen, with both blaming the other for the part they had played in Megan's disappearance.\n\nTeddy and Owen continued to serve in Iraq. One day, they were winning a soccer game when a helicopter brought in several patients. While they were improvising as they were low on supplies, an order from the Command came in for them to move back to the base. Teddy had to ride the Medevac with a couple of patients. Owen offered to trade places since she hates helicopters, but she declined and took off. Meanwhile, Owen and the rest of her platoon were driving to the base and found themselves unable to reach the base because of a storm. They ended up in an ambush, with Owen being the sole survivor. Teddy got on a helicopter when they realized something had gone wrong. Eventually, they found Owen in the desert, surrounded by his dead colleagues.<ref>[[Suicide is Painless]], x</ref>\n\nIn total, Teddy served three years in Baghdad and another two years in Landstuhl.\n\n\nOwen Hunt convinced Teddy to come work in Seattle, saying it was a great hospital with a great staff and equipment. She accepted and started work not too long after the merger. She got introduced to Jackson and Cristina, who was disappointed with a cardio goddess she'd never heard of. Owen then took Teddy to meet the Chief. Cristina later confronted her about nothing showing on Google about her, so Teddy informed Cristina about her education herself. Teddy then started cheering when it started to rain because of her long time in the desert. Later in the cath lab, she tried to teach Cristina, but she was already way ahead because she was used to the modern equipment, unlike Teddy. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Owen introduces Teddy to some colleagues.]]\nOver lunch with Arizona, Callie, and Mark, Teddy discovered that Owen brought her in as a present to his girlfriend Cristina and decided she'd enjoy the ways he was going to make it up to her. She finally managed to impress Cristina when she quickly diagnosed a kid with cardiac asthma. In surgery, she allowed Cristina to first assist and finally found something to teach her. Teddy displayed confidence in Cristina as she allowed her to fix a complication and then continued to guide her through the procedure. At the end of the day, Owen apologized for not telling her about Cristina. Teddy asked when he broke up with Beth and confessed she had always thought that he would call her when things with Beth ended and that she made up this entire story between them in her head. However, since he was with Cristina, she said she could now finally let that story go.<ref>[[New History]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy shares a look with Owen.]] Over the holidays, Teddy had a case with Cristina and Jackson as her residents that required them to wait for a heart for their patient. Meanwhile, Teddy declined to talk to Owen about what she had confessed earlier. The tension between them continued through Christmas, when Teddy was invited to the dinner at Meredith's. On New Year Eve's, Owen found himself staring at Teddy and couldn't keep it in any longer. He dragged her to a private room and expressed anger over her admitting her feelings. She wondered why as it clearly never mattered. He says it did and confessed he had felt the same way about her but never expressed those feelings because he never got any indication that she loved him, too. They almost shared a kiss until he stated he loved Cristina and left.<ref>[[Holidaze]], x</ref>\n\nSoon, Teddy allowed Cristina to perform her first solo valve replacement. Cristina practiced and guided the patient. In the OR, Cristina had difficulties locating a bleeding while Teddy refused to help. Cristina started panicking as she didn't know which option to choose to stop the bleeding. Owen, having observed from the gallery, came down to yell at Teddy as he was suspecting she wasn't helping Cristina because of her involvement with him. Teddy remained confident that Cristina would fix the problem and she did. Teddy later told Owen that Cristina needs to be pushed and that she would've stepped in if necessary. He knew, but he also needed to hear there was nothing else going on there. She didn't know what to say to him, but then decided it would be better for them if she left Seattle. Cristina found out and chased Teddy, desperately trying to find out what her new mentor needed in order to stay. Teddy confessed she wanted Owen and in the heat of the moment, Cristina blurted out that she could have him.<ref>[[Blink]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Teddy showed up to work as Richard asked her to finish out her contract. She and Cristina agreed to forget what was said. They shared a case where Teddy decided not to remove their singer patient's entire lung, but instead try to save part of it with chemo therapy. Her decision led Cristina to realize that Teddy understood Cristina's choice to choose surgery over a guy, and Cristina again requested to learn from Teddy. Teddy later met up with Owen at Joe's and she got drunk. She told him that Beth once told her she'd stop teaching to raise kids, which made Teddy realize she wasn't right for Owen as he needs someone with ambition. Then there was Cristina, the complete opposite, and Teddy told him that Cristina was willing to trade him for her. Owen then went home to tell Cristina that their relationship mattered as well as her career.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy attempts to talk to Owen.]] The day after, Teddy tried to talk to Owen about what she had said, but he refused to. She also refused to put Cristina on her service as she wanted to give the other residents a chance. However, when her patient was in critical condition in the OR, Teddy asked to have Cristina paged as she needed a skilled second set of hands. Cristina ignored the page per Owen's request as they were making out, leading to Teddy allowing Jackson to scrub in. After the surgery, she confronted Cristina about her answering her page and that she had expected they could at least keep things professional. Owen took the blame. Surprised to have him talk to her again, Teddy told them to forget about it.<ref>[[State of Love and Trust]], x</ref>\n\nThe tension between them resulted in Teddy blurting out a train of facts about her recent personal life when she and Owen were scrubbing in together. She said that he used to be her best friend whom she could tell everything to, and now he wouldn't even look at her. Owen said that happened because she confessed her feelings for him. She reminded him he did the same and then chose Cristina. Owen pointed out she chose Cristina, too, and said that he felt like he was cheating on Cristina every time he talked to her. However, he did admit he also missed his best friend. Teddy later caught up with Cristina and Owen and said she knew she talked about her feelings for Owen, but she decided to try like hell to unring the bell as she missed her best friend more than anything. She said she'd be fine as she had an amazing job with a great student to teach and a beautiful new cottage to live in. She then asked Cristina to scrub in with her.<ref>[[Valentine's Day Massacre]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Arizona befriends Teddy.]] Teddy continued to work with Cristina and they gradually became friends. However, Teddy continued to have a strained relationship with Owen while her feelings lingered. Arizona noticed her staring and decided they were going to be friends as she liked to fix things. She then invited Teddy to girls' night. Owen also later invited her to grab a beer, but she declined and headed out for girls night on the baseball field.<ref>[[Perfect Little Accident]], x</ref>\n\nA misunderstanding with Mark over breast implants led to Callie and Arizona suggesting to Mark and Teddy, respectively, that they should date. Arizona told Teddy that Mark was like candy, enjoy it and forget about it, while Callie had convinced Mark that Teddy was the serious thing he was looking for. This led to conflicting expectations so Teddy backed out. She sympathized with a patient's girlfriend who acted a little crazy upon thinking she loved her boyfriend more than he did her. Teddy then reconsidered and told Mark she was willing to go to dinner, but he said they would go to lunch in broad daylight so they could get to know each other, as he was now only interested in building a future with someone.<ref>[[Push]], x</ref>\n\nThe date went well and they got to know each other better. Teddy requested Owen as the required second physician when her patient requested physician-assisted suicide, but Owen made it clear he considered it killing the patient and declined. Teddy considered it an act of mercy and sought out Mark for his opinion. Teddy found out that Owen went to Chief Shepherd about the case behind her back and confronted him about this, but he just walked off. Derek had Teddy perform all the tests again so the hospital was covered. Owen barged in right before it happened and wondered why Kim wouldn't want to stick around in case they'd find a cure soon. Kim stated that clinging onto hope only made her feel lonely and that she wasn't afraid of death, wondering why he was. Teddy later witnessed Kim's death and then went to Mark's place for comfort and sex.<ref>[[Suicide is Painless]], x</ref>\n\nThey both considered the sex mind-blowing. Teddy came to realize that Kim's case triggered Owen's PTSD and despite her wanting to help, she opted against it since she was seeing Mark and since Cristina was already trying to help Owen. In surgery, Teddy discussed not having kids because of residency and the Army, but stated that she was now waiting for the right guy. Cristina then accidentally made a bullet explode inside their patient's chest, angering an already grumpy Owen even more. Teddy cautiously defended Cristina and took to fixing the damage. While scrubbing out, Teddy told Cristina that Owen had had it much worse than her and even she couldn't talk about what she's been through at any time, so she understood his not being able to talk about what was going on inside him. She said his triggers possibly could never go away, but she asked Cristina to give Owen time because it was very clear to Teddy how much he loved her. She also advised Cristina to just talk to Owen about how she felt as that would be more effective to get him to go to therapy than plainly telling him to do so. A second night of sex with Mark was interrupted when [[Sloan Riley|his pregnant daughter]] showed up in labor.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Parents]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy safely delivered the baby. The next day at work, she was thrown for a loop when famous cardiothoracic surgeon [[Thomas Evans]] came to the hospital for a procedure. Teddy then went to ask Derek if Tom was interviewing for her job since she had been waiting to hear from him about a permanent contract. Derek thought she was still looking elsewhere but promised to consider her for the position. While Cristina was amazed by Tom, Teddy didn't share the sentiment. Tensions between Teddy and Derek flared up when the latter explicitly stated you give people jobs because they have the right skills and not because they're family, and when Teddy made a patient's condition worse by sneezing as they were pulling a fish hook out of their patient's body. After the surgery, Derek told Teddy not to take it personally if she didn't end up getting the job as Tom just had published more and had won more awards, ignoring Teddy's bronze star for service to her country. Teddy was distraught over losing her job and Owen comforted her, which almost resulted in a kiss until they got paged about their patient being critical. Teddy thought her repair didn't hold and convinced Derek to open the patient back up despite him being unstable, only for Lexie to discover that he was unstable due to Klebsiella pneumonia. Having again blundered in front of Derek, Teddy considered herself doomed and wished Cristina good luck with her new attending, whom she pointed out never even let Cristina touch the patient. Cristina realized she needed Teddy to learn from and asked Owen to put in a good word for Teddy, but he did the exact opposite and told Derek that Teddy wouldn't have trouble finding a new job due to her connections on the East Coast. Derek did offer Teddy a permanent contract, but, unbeknownst to her, only because Tom Evans had declined the job.<ref>[[Hook, Line and Sinner]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy happily went to thank Owen as she heard from Cristina that he talked to Derek for her. However, Meredith found out the truth from Derek and observed Owen and Teddy closely all day as she was convinced Owen still had feelings for Teddy.<ref>[[How Insensitive]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a long day, Teddy went to Mark's place and stripped down to her underwear, only to find a naked [[Reed Adamson|Reed]] in Mark's bed. Mark suggested they could turn this into something fun, but Teddy declined. Owen suggested he do something to Mark to punish him, but Teddy wasn't mad as they weren't exclusive and she also didn't need Owen to defend her honor. Teddy later showed her romantic side when she opted to let two long-lost lovers catch up before their surgery. Owen admired her decision and looked at her longingly, which Cristina noticed after Meredith warned her to pay attention. In surgery, Owen finished Teddy's sentence and Richard likened it to his connection with Ellis Grey. Mark later came to apologize to Teddy. While she wasn't mad, she decided this thing between them was over. She later accidentally overheard Owen talking to Cristina about trying to get Teddy fired. He stated that Teddy was a trigger of his and that he didn't know how he felt about her as she's all wrapped up in his history and that she confused him. Teddy's pager gave away her presence and she rushed off to her patient.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref>\n\nFinding out the truth led to Teddy ignoring Owen outside of professional circumstances. She brushed off apologies and preferred to work in peace. They treated a gunshot victim together and took him to the OR. Cristina covered Teddy's post-ops and declined to scrub in. Since the patient was critical, neither of them had time to check their pagers, so Derek quietly informed Jackson about the shooter in the hospital and asked him to tell the attendings as soon as they were done. Teddy and Owen ignored Jackson's plea to stay in the OR per Derek's request and took the patient to the ICU.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref> As they were transporting the patient, Teddy opened up and said she came to realize that Owen tried to get her fired because he loved both her and Cristina and didn't want to choose himself. However, since their\ualives were now in danger, Teddy really wanted him to choose. He refused to do so. They found a dead resident in the ICU and decided to take the patient outside as they would be sitting ducks in the ICU. Outside, Owen and Teddy discovered that Cristina was still inside. She noticed how worried Owen was and realized he had made his choice. She told him it was okay to choose and body blocked the police officer so he could go back inside to find Cristina. Teddy herself boarded an ambulance and rode to Seattle Pres to operate on Alex's gunshot wound to the chest. She managed to save him despite all the blood loss.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy at Owen and Cristina's wedding.]] Teddy didn't suffer any problems following the shooting as she never faced the shooter. She kept checking on Alex and eventually advised him to have the bullet taken out after it surfaced, but he decided to keep it since chicks dug it. Teddy attended the meeting where Derek resigned and Richard was reinstated as Chief of Surgery. She and Owen worked on a case together and he inquired about the guy she was dating. She assured him she was happy he was getting married to Cristina and didn't elaborate. Meredith later walked in when Teddy and her guy, [[Andrew Perkins]], the trauma counselor brought in for the hospital staff, were making out. Teddy quickly left and went to tell Arizona. She later attended Owen and Cristina's wedding at Meredith's house.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\nAs Cristina was suffering from PTSD, Teddy and Owen advocated for her to be allowed back into the OR. Teddy had an ex vivo heart reconstruction planned and figured the pressure would be no problem for Cristina. Cristina was allowed on the case albeit with a serious lack of enthusiasm. When Teddy talked about Andrew with Arizona, it dawned on her that she did most of the talking while he just listened. In the OR, Teddy welcomed Cristina back and the surgery started. However, Jackson knocked over a tray, which triggered Cristina's PTSD and led to her lying down on the floor, unable to move. Teddy had to finish the risky surgery on her own and pulled it off. She then went to Andrew and voiced her concerns, but he said listening to her wasn't work to him and told her that he was enjoying this thing between them. They shared a kiss.<ref>[[Shock to the System]], x</ref>\n\nDespite knowing he'd leave Seattle after a month and planning to play it cool and smart, Teddy got attached to Andrew. On his last day, she avoided him all day in order not to cry. When he came to get her for their planned goodbye dinner, she confessed the way she felt about him. He hugged her and pointed out her habit to fall for unavailable men, noting she deserved better.<ref>[[Superfreak]], x</ref>\n\nWith Cristina no longer working on surgical cases, Teddy tried Jackson as her resident. She discovered his poor penmanship and ended up dictating charts till late at night, exhausting Teddy to the point where she refused to sleep with Mark to distract him from Arizona and Callie's relationship. When she noticed that Jackson flirted his way into her OR, she confronted him about it and said he was more than just the pretty face he made himself out to be.<ref>[[Can't Fight Biology]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Richard had all attendings pitch him an idea for a large sum of money for their department, the fourth-year residents had to step in as attendings. Cristina and April were to decide if Teddy's patient, [[Roy Henley]] was a transplant candidate, but Cristina barely participated to the point where Teddy told her to either get back in the game or get out. Psyched out by Callie, Teddy didn't stick to her notes and botched her pitch about stem cell heart generation because of her grudge against Derek. Meanwhile, Teddy thinking of her as useless made Cristina gather herself and make a decision regarding the patient.<ref>[[Almost Grown]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy briefly appeared in the [[Seattle Medical Documentary]], where she was seen ranting about the security system that trapped Jackson with her coding patient between doors. She also congratulated Arizona on winning the Carter Madison Grant.<ref>[[These Arms of Mine]], x</ref>\n\nIn a final attempt to lure Cristina back to surgery, Teddy had her monitor Roy while she went to pick up lungs. While it should have been an easy day, Cristina had to deal with multiple complications. With some help from Meredith, she perfectly managed. Teddy then returned with the lungs and the surgery went perfectly. Despite of that, Cristina realized that while she could still be a surgeon, she didn't want to be one anymore, so she quit.<ref>[[That's Me Trying]], x</ref>\n\nWhile presenting Roy's case, Teddy found herself under attack from various colleagues, including Derek, who thought she put too much pressure on Cristina, leading to her quitting. Missing her student, Teddy planned to corner Cristina at her housewarming party and convince her to come back. However, Derek thought it was time for them to back off. He arrived to the party early and took Cristina up to her roof, where they wouldn't find her.<ref>[[Something's Gotta Give]], x</ref>\n\nWith her star student gone, Teddy put her energy in finding a boyfriend. Despite her disliking it, she used online dating and went on a couple of bad dates. After she cut one of those dates short, she joined her colleagues at Joe's, only to find out that Cristina was working there. Teddy found this depressing and, adding the fact that her aspirational couple had broken up and was living on separate continents, got really drunk. Joe took away her keys so she went to the hospital to kill time, where she talked to Meredith about how she was depressed over what had happened recently.<ref>[[Slow Night, So Long]], x</ref>\n\n\nFeeling directionless without Cristina, whom Teddy learned went on a fishing trip with Derek, Teddy encountered [[Henry Burton]] on the elevator. He asked her how he looked and promptly informed her he was going to propose to his girlfriend. Teddy complimented his looks and added his girlfriend would be a fool to say no. She later ran into him again at the nurses' station and found out she had declined the proposal. He admitted he had proposed to her for her insurance since he capped out on his three surgeries ago. Teddy took his chart and learned he was suffering from Von Hippel-Lindau disease, having spent  days over the last three years. Henry told her Richard had just discharged him because he couldn't afford the surgery to remove the most recent tumor from his adrenal gland. Teddy then pleaded with Richard to operate on Henry pro bono. He refused since the hospital couldn't afford to pay for the long-term care that would ensue. Teddy stated he would do it if the patient were Derek's or Bailey's and said she needed something good to happen after Cristina quit, which Teddy partly blamed on herself. Richard then agreed to set up a meeting with the review board, which only led to the recommendation of a medicalert bracelet. Richard proceeded to discharge Henry after all, setting him up with an appointment at the Clinic. Teddy then dropped by Henry's room and offered to marry Henry since she had great insurance. He initially refused but Teddy persisted that she took an oath and couldn't leave him to fend for himself anymore than she could if she had found him bleeding out in the street.<ref>[[Adrift and at Peace]], x</ref> \n\nThey proceeded with the marriage and Teddy called Owen from city hall to come be her witness on a random weekday. She had the justice of peace skip right to the end of the ceremony since she had to go into work. Owen was baffled but she refused to talk about it with him. As they arrived at work, they found out that there had been a shooting at a nearby college, an emotional trigger for the staff given the recent hospital shooting. Cristina had been near the scene and arrived at the hospital with her hands plugging a hole in the patient's right ventricle. She moved to the OR along with the patient. Teddy paged Jackson for back-up. During the procedure, Richard arrived and identified the patient as the shooter. Several of the OR staff, including Jackson, couldn't bring themselves to help save the shooter. While Teddy needed a moment to gather herself, she reminded herself of her oath, which had also made her save several Iraqi soldiers who had blown up dozens of American soldiers. Unlike Jackson, Cristina decided to stay and help out. Owen found out and came to check on Cristina. Teddy gestured at him that she was doing okay in there. Cristina herself also stated she had no problem being there. Eventually, they finished the procedure successfully while the rest of the staff had gathered in the gallery. Richard proudly announced that his team had managed to save every last victim of the shooting despite the difficult circumstances. Afterward, Teddy met up with Henry at Joe's to arrange the insurance matter. He insisted on raising a glass first since they had skipped all the typical wedding stuff. She wasn't feeling it since she had spent her day saving a bad person but Henry reminded her that she had also saved him. She then agreed to the drink.<ref>[[Disarm]], x</ref>\n\nHenry was re-admitted for his surgery and informed his surgical team that he was now on his wife's insurance. Richard thought his girlfriend has wised up, at which point Teddy arrived in the room to pick the last few documents needing her signature pre-op. Henry then informed Richard that Teddy was his wife. Richard then went to yell at Teddy for committing fraud and acting unethically, which Lexie pointed out the medical community was actually split on. Teddy brushed off Richard's concerns and said it was done anyway. She then returned the signed documents to Henry, who hated that he had nothing to give her in return. She wished him good luck. Richard and Bailey later informed Henry that they needed to remove his kidney and Henry insisted on getting Teddy's opinion. Richard took the opportunity to berate Teddy some more so she pointed out other inappropriate relationships in the hospital. During the surgery, they found a cyst on Henry's pancreas and since removing it would make him a diabetic, they required her consent to remove it. Unbeknownst to Teddy, Henry had put her down as his emergency contact person. Also, Richard wanted to make sure that Henry had the support system to deal with diabetes. Teddy admitted she had no clue if there was someone he could lean on but gave permission to act as he saw fit. After the surgery, Teddy ran into Bailey. She was prepared for a long speech about how Richard was right but Bailey only confided in her about her fling with nurse Eli and the \"why not\" attitude she had adapted, thus not judging Teddy at all. Teddy sat by Henry's bedside until he woke up. She broke the news of him possibly developing diabetes to him, bringing up the emergency contact person issue. He knew she was angry about that and informed her his parents were dead and his estranged sister lived in Prague. Between his condition and him switching jobs regularly after maxing out on insurance policies, it was also hard to make friends, meaning Teddy was the closest thing he had to a friend. She sympathized with him and held his hand.<ref>[[Start Me Up]], x</ref>\n\nCristina started working on Teddy's service again, competing with Jackson over first assist for a CABG.<ref>[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]], x</ref> Together with Cristina, she performed a long diagonal aortic anastomosis during a heart transplant on a newborn in record-time.<ref>[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]</ref> \n\nTeddy was intercepted by Meredith for a consult as she was on her way out to meet a date in the lobby. Teddy's date agreed to wait for her wrap things up. Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Henry, who announced that he was in for some kind of test. Henry then introduced himself to William, who assumed he was another patient of Teddy's. As Teddy returned to Meredith for the consult, Henry sat down and started a conversation with William. Teddy ordered another set of X-rays and changed back into her scrubs. The images confirmed their suspicion of an aortic aneurysm. Teddy ordered a CT and then went to tell William that he'd have to wait longer than anticipated. He had no problem with that since he had Henry to keep him company. The patient coded in the scanner. While Meredith had started CPR, Teddy looked at the scans and diagnosed a dissecting aneurysm. They rushed the patient to the OR, where they opened up the patient without scrubbing. However, the aorta shredded right in front of their eyes and the patient bled out on the table. Teddy then returned to the waiting area, where William was making a phone call. Henry took the opportunity to inform her that he had vetted William and thought they could do better than him. William then informed Teddy he had managed to push back their reservation. Teddy left with him, sharing a meaningful look with Henry as they walked off.<ref>[[Golden Hour]], x</ref> \n\n\nThough the newlyweds both maintained that theirs was a simple marriage of convenience, and Teddy continued to date other men, Henry later confessed that he had feelings for Teddy. She told him she did not feel the same way.\uaWhen Andrew Perkins returned and asked Teddy to move to Germany with him, she accepted, and agreed to divorce Henry. However, in the\uaaftermath of a plane crash shortly after making that decision, Teddy changed her mind and told Henry that she was falling in love with him. The two began their married life properly, but not long into their wedded bliss, Henry died, leaving Teddy devastated. Teddy loved Henry and she blamed Owen for his death.\ua\n\n\nAfter Henry died, Teddy was not aware until after she finished her surgery on her patient. Cristina was the one to tell her in the scrub room and she broke down crying. She sat and cried next to Henry in the OR where he died. In her grieving process, she called Cristina in during her surgeries and made her tell her the exact story of Henry's surgery. This went on for about two weeks. She later went to a support group for widows to help her cope with his death, only to laugh at one of the other widows for saying her husband had \"minor congestive heart failure\" because according to Teddy, there is no such thing and he was lucky to survive as long as he did.\uaFinally, she was able to say the words \"I am a widow.\"\ua\n\n\nWhile Teddy was helping out Bailey and Callie with their patient, Owen told her that someone called him to ask if she was going to take the Chief job at MEDCOM, about which he didn't know anything. She told him that she planned to tell him about the job offer, and he was bummed that he now has to look for a new\ua[[Attending#Department Head|Head]]\uaof\ua[[Cardiothoracic Surgery]], on top of all other surgeons who were leaving [[Seattle]]. She then told him that she was not taking the job, but just hadn't had time to tell MEDCOM yet. Later in surgery, he wanted to know why she said no to the offer, especially because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. He asked her about her loyalty to her country. She then told him that she'd love to leave the hospital, as it kept reminding her of her\ua[[Henry Burton|deceased husband]]. \"I would love to leave here, and never look back. But you are as broken and beaten as I have ever seen you,\" she said, silencing him. \"And after everything I've put you through, the tolerance and kindness and friendship that you have shown me, I am not going to leave you, because of my loyalty. I am not going to leave here for MEDCOM or anywhere else,\" she told him, after which she continued operating.\n\nOwen later approached her, saying that he now knew why she tried so hard to keep Cristina in Seattle. \"If Cristina were staying, you'd be taking that job,\" he said. She stayed silent, and he assured her he'd be fine. She told him he wouldn't be, as he was losing the love of his life. Owen then opened up to her and said that he already missed Cristina, while she hadn't even left yet. \"I wish I could tell you that that will go away, but it won't,\" she said, before walking away again. He later asked her to come to a conference room to talk. While she was saying she was happy to stay as it'd be like them back in Iraq again, he suddenly said that she was fired. She laughed, thinking he was joking, but she realized it was serious when he told her it was \"effective and immediately\".\n\n[[File:xLeavingSeattle.png|thumb|px|Teddy hugs Owen one last time before leaving the hospital.]]\n\n\"Now, I know you have other opportunities, so if you need to make those phone calls...\" he began, but she told him that he couldn't tell her when to go and when to stay. \"I don't want you here anymore!\" he yelled, continuing that she had to have seen it coming for months as she had been disruptive in the OR and hostile and insubordinate towards him in front of staff and students. \"We're past all of that,\" she still tried to talk him out of his decision.\ua\"We are, because you're fired,\" he told her once again. \"It's a done deal, pack your stuff,\" he said. She then angrily left the room while scolding him. Moments later, she came back in, crying. She realized that being fired by Owen was the only way he could make her do what she really wanted to do: taking the job at MEDCOM. She hugged him tightly, urging him to fight for Cristina. \"You go, and be great,\" he told her, while hugging her too.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Megan was found in a basement of an abandoned house, she was transferred to a hospital in Germany. Owen told Amelia to request Teddy while on the phone with the hospital, since he was in disbelief that the patient was identified correctly as his sister. Teddy reassured Amelia and Owen that the patient was Megan Hunt and made sure Megan would be transferred to Grey Sloan. Owen refused to talk to Teddy when she had tried to call him.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy comes to Seattle to support Owen and Megan.]] After Megan had arrived in Seattle, Teddy surprised Owen by showing up to support him. Megan and Teddy caught up and discussed a guy Teddy had had a few dates with. Teddy briefly met Amelia when she stopped by Megan's room and also checked in with Arizona and April in the cafeteria. During Megan's first surgery, Teddy helped to calm a panicking and fearful Owen. After the surgery, Teddy found out about Meredith and Nathan's short-lived romance and pressed Owen, Nathan, and Meredith to come clean to Megan, as she thought Megan had the right know, especially with Meredith as her surgeon. Amelia stood up for Meredith, which resulted in Teddy scolding her for not being present to support Owen. Teddy continued to urge Nathan and Owen to tell the truth, which was overheard by Maggie, who sided with Teddy. While waiting with Owen during the surgery to close Megan's abdominal wound, Teddy brought Amelia's absence to Owen's attention. Nathan then came to get them as the surgery was almost over, but they came just in time to witness Meredith realizing there wasn't enough tissue to close.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy was with Megan when she woke up after the failed surgery. Owen privately confessed to her that he was happy, since it meant Megan couldn't go back to Iraq just yet. Meredith later paged Teddy and asked her to be a part of her planned abdominal transplant surgery for Megan. Meredith assured her she could separate the personal and professional, so Teddy agreed. She was excited at the prospect of this procedure being a possibility to help many soldiers with similar injuries. While Meredith went on to search for a donor, Megan's loved ones, including Teddy, sprung into action to find a way to get Megan's son Farouk to the U.S., but to no avail. After sending Owen out to run an errand, Teddy, Megan, and Evelyn discussed his marriage to Amelia and came to conclude that it was a sham marriage. They helped him realize that Amelia was absent and that his not needing her there for him was a problem, too. Teddy then went to scrub in for the surgery, which they pulled off successfully. That night, Owen and Teddy went to relax at the park. He talked about he and Amelia had grown apart and then leaned in to kiss Teddy. She broke it off after kissing him back. She explained that he was her favorite human on the planet and she knew him well enough to know that if they were meant to be more than friends, it couldn't start with his cheating on Amelia. The shame and guilt would kill him, so she decided they needed to stay just friends for now.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref> With Megan's health problems solved, Teddy returned to Germany.\n\nMonths later, she was surprised by Owen showing up at her place in the middle of the night. He then revealed to her that his marriage with Amelia was over, leaving nothing standing in their way. They then kissed and proceeded to have sex. After sex, they admitted they both had imagined that moment. They reminisced about the first time they met and operated together, something they both wanted to do for the rest of their lives. As they cuddled and watched the snow, she recalled the moment he made it snow in Iraq for his troops. She deemed him great at grand gestures, which led to her wondering if this was one of them. While she didn't like the country, she did like the life she build for herself in Germany. Owen suggested he move to Germany as he really wanted to be with her, for real. She asked him to spend some more days with her to figure things out and also questioned the end of his marriage. He admitted that that was what led him to her. She questioned that and he revealed that Amelia told him to go see her. Teddy soon figured out Amelia did so shortly after they had had sex again, which was just one day before he hopped on the plane to Germany.\n\nInfuriated over this, Teddy packed his bag for him while blaming him for being terrified of being alone. She listed all his relationships and suggested he had a pathological need to be coupled up so no one would see how sad and empty he is. He bounced back that she was afraid to be happy, stating that she was fine to marry the dead guy but wasn't willing to enter a relationship with a man who truly loved her. She forbade him from talking about Henry. He continued to say that she would rather burn everything to the ground than risk being hurt. She then yelled that hurting was all he ever did, stringing her along for years with half-baked declarations and then marrying other women. He had actually convinced her that he was truly in love with her, that he wanted her, but she came to realize it never was about her. She stated she was done being his sloppy seconds or his consolation prize. Owen told her that the thing with the snow, he did it for her because he knew how much she loved Christmas. Teddy ignored it and told him they were done. She threw him out of her apartment and broke down.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\nSeeing how miserable Owen was, Amelia reached out to Teddy on his behalf, but Teddy made it clear she had no interest in him anymore.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]],x</ref>\n\n\nNearly three months later, she arrived at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] again and was unable to find anybody she knew. She finally ran into Bailey, who had her scrub in for an emergent surgery. In surgery, Teddy told Bailey that she came here looking for a job. Since Bailey didn't immediately respond, Teddy tried to take it back. After surgery, Teddy apologized to Bailey for putting her on the spot. Bailey told Teddy that her question was actually yet another sign in her life. She had wanted to temporarily step down from the Chief of Surgery position to fall in love with surgery and research again and spend more time with her family. She then offered the job of Interim Chief of Surgery to Teddy, who was very much interested. After their talking it over, Teddy stayed in [[Lila (All of Me)|Lila's]] mother's ICU room so she could see her daughter's wedding via livestream. Lila's mother noticed how moved she was and how she kept touching her stomach. She asked Teddy if she was expecting, which Teddy confirmed.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nThe next morning, Teddy went to surprise Owen at his house but was instead greeted at the door by [[Betty Nelson|Betty]], who mentioned the [[Leo Hunt|baby]]. Teddy's vision of a future in Seattle was shattered and she claimed to be at the wrong house. She returned to the hospital to tell Bailey she couldn't accept the job after all because of her not wanting to return to Seattle. On her way out, she bumped into Owen, Amelia, and Leo and hastily said goodbye. While walking, she started experiencing pain in her leg and, suspecting a deep vein thrombosis, she had [[Casey Parker|intern Casey]] get her [[Maggie Pierce]] for a consult. During the consult, Teddy found out about Maggie's relations to Meredith, Amelia, and Owen. She pressed Maggie not to tell anyone about her pregnancy and left against medical advice.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> Maggie had trouble keeping the secret from Amelia and reached out to Teddy to ask her to inform Owen, but Teddy did not answer her calls.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref> Maggie ended up telling Meredith while Teddy stayed holed up in her hotel room, agonizing over what to do next.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref> [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith invites Teddy to talk.]] Meredith tracked her down to a playground where she used to make Cristina get her coffee. Teddy understood that Maggie had told her. Meredith invited her to her house to talk while she baked cookies for Zola's bake sale. Teddy took over when she saw how clumsy Meredith was. Teddy shared her plan to go back to Germany and raise the baby by herself, because she found out that all the terrible things she said about Owen she had come to Seattle to apologize for were actually true. Meredith explained the Betty and Leo situation to her and asked her why she was still in Seattle, but Teddy had no answer to that. Teddy said she hated Owen, but Meredith asked he\uaif she hated him enough to deny her child a father who was not a terrible man. Later, Teddy talked about how she joined the Army to get out of New York City where her best friend and parents died. Then she met Owen, the buttoned-up and decisive surgeon who never had doubts and did not try to fix her. She instantly fell in love with him, but he was engaged and she couldn't stand losing someone else, so she stayed quiet and played it safe. Telling Meredith about it made her realize she actually still loved him. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith tells Teddy that kids change everything.]] She then brought up that she did not know how to tell Owen. She asked Meredith if the tumor removal had changed Amelia to the point where she now did want a family, because Owen had told her all about Amelia going back and forth on that subject. Meredith didn't know where Amelia was on that subject, but she did urge Teddy to tell Owen as soon as possible to minimize the damage the news would cause. Teddy knew she would never lose Owen, because he's loyal, but she did not want him to get together with her out of obligation for the baby. Meredith told her that everything would change once the baby arrived and reminded Teddy that she would be telling Owen for the baby, not for herself. Meredith sent her back to the hotel with some cookies and once again urged her to tell Owen soon.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy visited Owen's house the next day, but she found Owen and Amelia panicking because Betty had run away from school. Teddy decided not to surprise them with more bad news and helped to look for Betty in the city, but none of them found her. They later reconvened at the house. Owen took Amelia to a meeting while Teddy stayed behind in case Betty came back. He returned with Leo later and while they were alone, she brought up her last visit. He knew he should have called her to tell her about Leo, but he was too embarrassed to do so after her accusations against him. He talked about how he always wanted a kid and then Leo turned into a whole family situation with Betty and Amelia. Realizing Owen was happy with his life, she decided again not to tell him and left while he comforted a crying Leo.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy came by the hospital to help out when a windstorm was approaching the city. Owen asked her how long she would be staying in Seattle, to which she replied she didn't know yet. She got pulled onto a case with Owen and she spotted Betty out in the ER, alerting Owen to her presence. After he made sure she was okay, they scrubbed in for surgery. She told him they needed to talk afterwards and agreed to get coffee. However, during the surgery, he figured out that her news must have been the reason she came to Seattle. As soon as the critical part of the surgery over, she blurted out the news, but she was paged to the ER immediately after, leaving a baffled Owen behind. Teddy ran into Amelia downstairs who thanked her for her help with Betty and then went off to look for Owen. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen confronts Teddy about her hiding the pregnancy for so long.]] Owen caught up with Teddy on the elevator ride up to the OR and asked her how she could have kept this for him for so long. She bounced back that it hadn't exactly been easy for her. She told him no one expected him to do anything. Their talk was interrupted by Amelia, who got on to tell Owen that she was planning on becoming Betty's official foster mother. She then picked up on the awkward vibe between them and asked what was going on, after which the power died due to the storm and they got stuck on the elevator together.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nOwen informed Amelia and vented some anger at Teddy for keeping at a secret until today, but they had to focus on saving the patient who had started crashing. Teddy explained she came to tell him but found out he had started another family in record time. She clarified that by not expecting him to do anything, she meant that the two of them getting together was off the table, so he could be as involved as he wanted to be and stay with Amelia. She then told him she was staying in Seattle because her baby deserved a father and she deserved her friend. When the patient had been stabilized, she told him she was at sixteen weeks, that the baby was fine, and that she did not know the sex yet. Later, Amelia yelled at her for not realizing she had a stake in this, too, with Betty and Leo. Their argument ended when the elevator doors opened and they rushed to the OR, where they saved him. Afterwards, Teddy admitted she did want him to be involved. He did, too. They then agreed to figure things out together and decided to celebrate that they were having a baby.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]],x</ref>\n\nHaving decided to stay in Seattle, Teddy approached Bailey for a job, but she was referred to Alex, the new Chief. Alex made her audition for Maggie, which enraged her. She ran into Owen and took out her frustration in him, saying she had to uproot\uaher whole life so he could be a part of the baby's life. He once again blamed her for staying silent for weeks because he and Amelia weren't back together when she first arrived, meaning she was the reason he was in this crap situation. Amelia overheard that talk, so Owen went after her to clarify things while Teddy approached Maggie about the job. Maggie was mad at her for waiting too long to tell Owen and Amelia, but she did acknowledge Teddy had done some great work on the department and decided to shove aside her personal contempt so they could work together. [[File:x-.png|thumb|Owen and Teddy make arrangements for the future.]] Later, Teddy found out that Owen had accidentally been paralyzed in the OR and she sat by his bed until he recovered. She then told him that she did not set out to hurt Amelia and even though she made mistakes, he could not blame everything on her. His anger and having to work under Maggie made her think about going back to Germany, because she had the perfect job, which was still open, and generous maternity leave there, while Owen did not have to sacrifice a thing. She invited him to move to Germany with her, but he told her she could have his job, realizing it was time for him to make a sacrifice. She happily accepted and they hugged it out.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nNow officially employed, Teddy made acquaintances with Tom Koracick as he was practicing for Catherine's surgery. While he was nervous, she expressed confidence in him. Shortly after the surgery, she ran into him and congratulated him on the good outcome. He was a bit down because they didn't get it all. To cheer him up, she offered to buy him a drink, but he preferred a rain check because he wanted to smell good when she spent money on him.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nOver time, Tom and Teddy interacted some more while at work. On Christmas Eve, Owen took Teddy out into the ambulance bay to stand in the snow. He invited her to spend Christmas with him, Amelia, and Leo\uabut she would be covering the ER. He assured her that they would establish their own traditions with their baby, too. On New Year's Eve, Teddy attended the party thrown by Alex and Jo, which is where she shared her first kiss with Tom at midnight. Nearing Valentine's Day, Teddy had another ultrasound with Owen present. Together, they found out that they were having a baby daughter. To celebrate Valentine's Day, Tom took Teddy to get the best mani/pedi in Seattle to help her relax. Afterwards, he arranged dinner for two of them.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nAs their relationship developed, Tom and Teddy found out they were staying at the same hotel and bonded over the breakfast buffet. Owen wasn't happy when he found out about the two of them. Later, Tom and Teddy worked on [[Lucille Reid]], a patient who had a very close friend by her side at all times aside from her husband. In surgery, Teddy commented on their situation and said the whole thing was just a whole lot of denial, thinking that Lucille's friend was settling for table scraps because she was married. She said there's always a torchbearer in that type of situation. Tom thought she was talking from experience as a torchbearer from her situation with Owen and left, stating he was done. After the successful surgery, Lucille's husband Marvin told her that the situation was hard to figure out. Lucille and Julian just decided a long time ago to let their love just be the easy kind and not risk it on something as fickle as sex and romance. While he was Lucille's third husband, there had only been one Julian, and he was fine with that. Afterwards, Teddy comforted a distressed Owen when the arrival of Betty's parents made him fear that he would lose Leo. That night, Teddy visited Tom in his hotel room and told him that sometimes, friendships are meant to be just that despite big feelings. While she and Owen were meant to be just friends, she thought she and Tom were something else. They shared a kiss and he invited her in for a club sandwich.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy was surprised to be dating at  weeks old, but she enjoyed it. When the hospital was flooded with victims from a mass overdose, Teddy was forced to page Owen while he was saying goodbye to Leo. He happily accepted the patient influx to keep himself distracted. Later, Betty was found was to be amongst the patient and she started to show symptoms of an aortic dissection, caused by her combining meth and opioids. Teddy diagnosed it and decided to operate herself because the situation was so dire that it would be better for Amelia if her sister was not Betty's surgeon. Maggie agreed and let her do it. Teddy put in a stent and also had to reconstruct her entire distal aorta, but Teddy pulled it off and Betty made it through. Teddy delivered the news to Owen, Betty's parents, and Amelia, who hugged her in relief. At the end of the day, Teddy took moment in a quiet ER to unwind.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, Teddy and Tom attended Catherine's party together. Owen and Amelia caught the two of them making out in the hallway and Teddy shared that Tom gave her a surprise trip to Palm Springs, which Owen did not like. He provided her with drinks and snacks throughout the evening, knowing she wasn't having a good time with Owen angrily staring at them the entire time. He offered to feign diarrhea, but she didn't want him to leave a party thrown in his honor. Shortly before Catherine's arrival, an argument erupted between Owen and Tom when he tried to talk Teddy out of taking the trip. She insisted on going and Owen called him out for preying on a pregnant woman and yelled that he did not want a dirtbag like Tom around his daughter, stating he was not a father. Tom then punched him. Owen wanted to retaliate, but Teddy blocked him and said Tom was a father. Tom then put his hand in an ice bucket and went to give the speech, which was cut short when a supposed fire broke out in the kitchen and everyone was evacuated.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy and Tom enjoyed their trip together.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref> When she returned, Owen was grumpy because he was on his own with Leo now that Amelia had decided to remove herself from the situation. They treated an expecting couple and Teddy sat by the woman's bed in the ICU to make sure she made it through the night. Owen offered to do it, but she preferred to do it herself and Tom was away to Baltimore, so Owen decided to sit with her and he rubbed her feet. When the patient deteriorated and became at risk of losing her baby because a necessary hysterectomy, the doctors were thrown for a loop when [[Vincenzo DeLuca]] came out of nowhere promising a miraculous fix with his gestational sacks research. However, he was overstepping as the research was not even close to human trials, so Alex stopped that from happening and the doctors planned the hysterectomy. Teddy later comforted the couple as they mourned the loss of the baby and broke down in Owen's arms once she left the room as Tom watched them.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nWith a birthing class coming up, Teddy invited Tom to join while Owen also told her he was coming. However, before the class started, she started to experience pain. She thought it was stress and went to Maggie's blue-light room, but that did not help, so she had intern Casey page OB and Owen, who left Tom in the birthing class. Carina examined her and diagnosed cervical insufficiency, so Teddy put herself in a Trendelenburg position. On Carina's suggestion, Owen put a gurney next to hers and started talking to Teddy and his daughter to calm them down, praising Teddy, while Teddy herself felt too shy to talk to baby, thinking the insufficiency meant she was already failing as a mother. Tom later joined them when he found out what happened. Teddy told him she did not want to worry him. He then sat by her side and fed her ice cream.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after, Tom and Teddy started looking at houses together. Owen offered Teddy to move in with him, but she declined and said she'd figure it out. They were surprised when [[Megan Hunt]] dropped by the hospital to assist on a case. When Megan found out what had been going on between them, she called Owen a dum-dum for letting it get to that point by his behavior, to which Teddy kind of agreed. Megan later sat down with Teddy as she was looking at houses and told her that while Owen was an idiot, he did love her and that Teddy could let it be easy if she wanted it to. Teddy said she did not want to take Amelia's vacant spot in that house, which Megan understood.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref> Megan convinced Owen to go to therapy. Per Megan's request, Teddy checked in on him after his first session via text message.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nWith the due date three weeks away, Teddy still had not found a place because she kept comparing everything to her perfect place in Germany. Meanwhile, Tom made arrangements to have someone cover him in Baltimore so he could stay with her until the birth and asked Teddy if that was okay with her, which was the case. While Tom set out to find her a house, Teddy noticed that [[Jo Wilson|Jo Karev]] was off balance when she made a mistake with [[Gus Carter]]. She tried to get Jo to talk to her, but Jo refused, so Teddy took her concerns to Chief Bailey. Afterwards, Tom paged her to a room to show her that he had rented her the perfect place that closely resembled her place in Germany, stating that the baby deserved a happy mother and more than a hotel room. Teddy loved the place and agreed to move in.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy and Tom started planning the nursery together. With [[Maggie Pierce]] out camping, Teddy took the case of [[Gus Carter]] while also treating [[Kari Donnelly]]. After hearing Kari talk about how [[Toby Donnelly|Toby's bravery]] had inspired her to live her best life, Teddy realized that she loved Owen and wanted more than the safe feeling that Tom gave her. While Tom waited for her at home with dinner and IKEA furniture for the nursery, she went over to Owen's house but only Amelia and Leo were home. Teddy thought she and Owen were back together, but Amelia was just there for Leo. Teddy then told her that Tom made her laugh and feel safe, but Owen made her feel passion, rage, and ecstasy. While she and Owen hurt each other, she wanted that kind of love in her life so her daughter, too, would know it. She wanted to tell Owen all that before the baby was born, but Amelia pointed out that her water had broken.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs fog started to cover Seattle, Amelia made arrangements with the hospital and set up a babysit for Leo while Teddy realized she had not planned for the baby's arrival at all, something her late mother would chastise her for. Amelia timed Teddy's contractions and deemed they had enough time to drive to the hospital herself. However, the freeway was closed due to the fog and they got stuck in a traffic jam, but Amelia got inventive and made a police officer drive them in his car. Teddy appreciated her genius move and stated they could be friends in another life. Amelia said they could be friends in this one if Teddy could overcome her disdain. Teddy said that was only last year, but that was to blame on the tumor. She then asked Amelia if she was still in love with Owen. Amelia said maybe she was a little bit, but that she fell in love quickly and easily. She then let slip Owen's brief fling with Carina while talking about having a little crush on Carina, which agitated Teddy.\n\nThey were met by Owen when they arrived at Grey Sloan. Teddy yelled at him for hiding his dating her OB. Owen helped her get settled in the delivery room and apologized for the Carina thing, while Carina said it meant very little to her. Carina examined her and found that the crowning was happening fast because it was a geriatric pregnancy, a term that did not put Teddy at ease. She forbade Owen from watching what was going on down there and started pushing. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy and Owen hold their baby girl Allison.]] With the head halfway out, Teddy had to wait for the next contraction to push to avoid tearing, so she asked Owen to distract her. He then told her he had always been in love with her, but it felt so good that he always sabotaged it himself before life could do it. He had learned that in therapy, but he had overcome that now and he wanted to spend the rest of his life proving that he was worthy of her love. Soon after, the baby girl was delivered and the parents simultaneously decided on Allison as a name. They spent the rest of the day cuddling their baby girl, while Tom was still in the dark as he was setting up the nursery.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy struggles as a new mother.]]\nShe, Owen, and Allison were soon visited by Amelia, who brought by Leo. Teddy was forced to take care of Leo when Bailey came to fetch Owen and Amelia for a trauma. She couldn't get him to stop crying, but she was saved by Tom when he came in and took him off her hands. Tom figured she had given birth when she didn't reply to his calls. He also knew she must have gotten back together with Owen, who rode in on a white horse and made all the right promises. Teddy took all the blame and started telling Tom he was a wonderful. He knew that and told her she would come to regret her decision, and then he would be there for her because he loved her. In the meantime, they would remain friends. Tom then took Leo back to daycare. A week later, Teddy had returned to her hotel room, where she was holed up with a crying Allison. She became miserable. Owen dropped by with supplies and invited her to come live with him, but she refused, stating they weren't supposed to start their lives together in that house. Owen took care of Allison so she could go shower.\n\nTheir arrangement continued over the next couple of weeks, with Owen eager to help out but handling things badly. When Teddy had a clogged duct, he offered to milk her. She was offended and took off with Allison. She developed the habit to go to the hospital with the baby to calm herself down whenever she would panic. During one of those visits, she ran into Bailey and she confessed that she hated maternity leave and that she felt like a bad mother. Bailey distracted her with some work talk and stressed that hating maternity leave didn't mean she was a bad mother, because Bailey had hated it, too. Another week later, Owen finally stepped up and came to tell Teddy he had listed his house and already had hundreds of listings for other houses to look at. He had also upgraded them to a suite for the meantime. Teddy thanked him for finally listing the house and they shared a kiss.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOne morning, Owen was paged to the hospital for a trauma so Teddy had to take Leo to daycare. She brought Allison and hung out at the hospital for a while. Owen found her changing Allison outside on a bench near the coffee cart and took over from her since she was failing. Teddy was planning on going to the park but Owen suggested a tour of the hospital instead, humoring Teddy as he knew she was missing the smell of blood. He showed her scans of a patient of his with a dissection. She pitched a solution that had good results on a case she had back in Germany. Owen was informed that Tom was approaching so they moved to the OR gallery, where she told Allison about the cool things they get to do in there. Owen then suggested he stay home with Allison for a while so she could go back to work. She refused because she didn't like failing as a mother but Owen said being back to work would make her happy again, which in turn would make her a better mother. Besides, he didn't like work when he had to avoid Tom. She then happily accepted his offer and went to get changed right away, leaving Allison in his care.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after returning to work, Teddy worked with Maggie and Taryn on a woman who had been hit by the frozen body of a stowaway who had fallen out of a plane. Teddy had seen a similar case in Germany. Link came to assist and Teddy asked him to harvest a vein from the patient's leg but by the time he was done scrubbing in, the patient had been declared dead. Teddy felt that the world was broken, not just the medical system, as it forced people to climb into planes and freeze to death and then crash into innocent people who were in the absolute worst place on Earth possible; a feeling that only got stronger now that she had a baby to raise in that world. Owen came to pick her and Leo up. On their way out, they ran into Tom, who had gotten rid of the restraining order so Owen could return to work. Owen surprised them both by revealing he had taken a job at Pac-North. Tom thought he would come to regret that and invited him to call him when that happened, reminding Teddy that the same was still true for when she regretted choosing Owen over him. Teddy and Owen walked off smiling and she teased him about his new workplace.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Owen dropped off a box of handmade costumes his mother had made for him and Megan. Teddy was impressed Evelyn had the time to make costumes herself while working full-time and raising two kids by herself. They agreed to meet up that night for the parade on the peds floor. She, Bailey, and Tom operated on a man who was competing in a costume contest, which led her to wonder when costumes became so important. She thought Owen was equating good costumes to good parenting. She didn't know what they were doing since they skipped so many steps at once by going from best friends to a family of four overnight. Tom told her he didn't understand what she was doing either and told her not to let Owen make her feel inept at motherhood over costumes. Bailey advised Teddy not to worry about the costumes and just enjoy the time with her kids. After taking the patient's loved ones to go see him post-op, Teddy met up with Owen on the peds floor. She dressed up as a kick-ass surgeon and told him she wouldn't be like his mother. He knew that, which is why he brought over the box to see if any costumes might fit Leo or Allison. She then understood he hadn't brought over the box to shame her and admitted it had inspired her. She revealed she had dressed up their children as zombies, which neither he nor Bailey liked as a costume for babies.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy dropped Owen off at Pac-North one day. He tried to take a picture of Allison but his phone storage was full. She told him to delete some stuff but he said he needed a bigger phone. He kissed her goodbye and went inside while she drove off to Grey Sloan.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref> Teddy took the day off to support Meredith on the day of her hearing before the medical commission. She and Owen entered the hotel arguing about sleep training, which all sources gave different advice on. Since she was suffering from severe cumulative sleep deprivation, she happily accepted Link's coffee. When [[Paul Castello]] had a seizure and was taken to Grey Sloan, Teddy and Link drove behind it. At the hospital, they took scans and diagnosed a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. Tom took on the case and started operating to evacuate the hemorrhage. Teddy sat with Amelia in the gallery until Link came in. After Paul died, the three of them drove back to the hotel, where they learned Meredith got to keep her license. Teddy congratulated her with the others and went back to work afterward.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie asked Teddy to scrub in with her for a valve replacement. While Teddy found it odd for such a basic procedure, she happily accepted the opportunity to operate on a non-traumatized heart for the first time in months. During surgery, Teddy talked about the work at Pac-North. Owen had shown her around there and asked her to come run cardio. She had been thinking about it because she was missing cardio and Maggie was doing a terrific job at it at Grey Sloan. Maggie then scolded her for chit-chatting. Near the end of the surgery, Tom complimented Teddy on her technique from the gallery. Once he was gone, Maggie wondered why Teddy didn't tell him to leave her alone. Teddy still felt guilty for breaking his heart and he was harmless. Maggie asked if she was sure because it seemed to her like Tom still thought he had a future with her and Teddy didn't seem to want to set the record straight. Teddy was then called away for a trauma in the pit but soon returned when Maggie was panicking over the fact that the patient's heart hadn't restarted yet after having taken him off bypass. Teddy pointed out it was likely hibernating myocardium and got Maggie to calm down and agree to her recommendation. After updating the patient's wife, Tom told Teddy he was in need of a new Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. She thought he had fired Maggie to give her what she wanted and finally told him she had really moved on from him. Tom informed her Maggie had actually quit herself and proceeded to point out that Owen still hadn't proposed to her while he had a baby with her, while Tom was ready to marry Teddy this very day. He asked if she really wanted to close the door on him and walked off, leaving her to overthink what he had said.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy was on duty in the ER when several of Grey Sloan's residents were brought in injured after a car crashed into Joe's bar. She and Amelia teamed up to treat Casey, who was experiencing a severe PTSD exacerbation but went missing on their watch. While they were looking for him, they came across Owen, who complained about Tom being an ass to him. Teddy asked him to cut Tom some slack. Teddy also vented to Amelia about Owen not having proposed yet. It made her wonder if her showing up pregnant with his child triggered his PTSD, which was rooted in a pattern of obligations and not wanting to disappoint people, and made him feel trapped with her. Amelia said she thought Owen was just trying to do things differently. She and Amelia found Casey in the hyperbaric chamber and took him the neuro ICU to monitor him. Teddy also performed an angio on [[Levi Schmitt]], who was experiencing heart attack-like symptoms but turned out to be suffering from broken heart syndrome. Afterward, Owen took Teddy to an on-call room and proposed. She stopped him mid-proposal and told him he didn't have to propose and she didn't want to reinforce his PTSD patterns. He said she wasn't and that he was starting a new pattern of loving her and their family with his whole heart. She then gladly accepted his proposal and they went out to cheer the news with some staff, including Amelia and Link, while a disdained Tom looked on from a distance.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Teddy lost the ring and she started looking around at work. When Owen dropped by for a surprise lunch to discuss wedding plans, she blurted out she had lost the ring and got emotional because she aware of the significance it had in his family. Owen told her not to worry and assured her they would find it. Owen took apart the sink pipes in the attendings' lounge as Teddy thought she may have lost it there, but it wasn't in there. They then received word that Leo was vomiting in daycare and went to check on him. They took an X-ray to be safe and discovered Leo had swallowed the ring. While they waited for Leo to pass it, Owen told her she could keep the ring stored somewhere and only wear it for special occasions and suggested she just wear a necklace with the first letter of each of their family members on it. When Leo finally pooped, Teddy volunteered to find the ring.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy took a leave of absence when the children got sick and ended up missing more work because she got the flu herself.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref><ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAs a snowstorm hit Seattle, Owen and Teddy dropped off the kids at his mother's. At work, Teddy grew suspicious when she found Amelia was on leave and there were troubles between her and Link. After working with Owen and Maggie to save a woman and her baby, Teddy walked out into the snow in the ambulance bay to quiet her mind. Tom joined her with hot cocoa. She opened up and told him she had been having this fear for months that Owen was the father of Amelia's baby and that she and Owen would never work out because he would always be in love with Amelia. Tom assured her that Owen was clearly in love with Teddy. Teddy told him he was a good man. Tom said that people were not letting him in no matter how hard he was trying. She repeated she liked him. They then had a snowball fight. Later, Teddy ran into Maggie and told her about her fear, asking if she was being crazy. Maggie told her she was not. Her fear amped up, Teddy went to Tom's hotel room and kissed him. She entered the room, not noticing Owen's text to ask her to go sledding with him.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen assures Teddy she is not a replacement.]]\nOwen started to plan their wedding and had his mom send him venue suggestions. He tried discussing it with Teddy in front of Tom but she brushed it off and suggested they get a wedding planner, which he turned down. Once Owen left, Teddy accused Tom of acting weird by being nice to Owen, which could lead to him finding out what happened between them. Tom said he wanted it to keep happening. Teddy insisted it hadn't meant anything and that she had been acting out of fear. Maggie interrupted their talk to discuss a patient but once Tom was gone, Teddy spilled her secret to Maggie. Later in the day, she tried to ignore Owen but ended up telling him that the baby might be his. She asked him what that would mean for them. He took a beat to answer, which upset her. Teddy later vented to Maggie and mentioned that Amelia was playing with people's feelings, which Maggie pointed out Teddy had done with her own pregnancy. Teddy apologized and went to find Tom in his office. She told him he made her feel good and in control, so she felt bad about hurting a good guy like him. While he disagreed on being a good guy, they ended up making out again. Afterward, Teddy went home and found Owen waiting for her with a home-cooked meal. He said he was just shocked when Teddy told him about Amelia's baby earlier. He assured her she was not a replacement and that he would always love her, no matter what.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Amelia informed all parties involved that Link was the father of the baby. In a supply closet, Teddy told Tom that the news hadn't changed the way she felt about him. Teddy and Amelia worked on [[Kyle Rexton]] together, which caused Amelia to wonder if love only meant sacrifice. Teddy thought so, stating she left behind her life in Germany for a marriage that only might work. Amelia reminded her again that Owen was not the father, but Teddy said that hypotheticals have consequences, too. While Amelia operated on Kyle, Tom sat with Teddy in the gallery and told her that he wouldn't be the man sleeping with a married woman. He wanted to make it easy for her so he told her to go home and be with Owen, adding that he would be fine. Teddy ended up crying on a bench outside, where Owen found her. She almost told him about Tom but then changed her mind, claiming she was crying over her rough day. He comforted her.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy attended the Surgical Innovation Conference. Happy to spend some time without her kids, she headed to heart valve happy hour. Over cocktails, she encouraged Maggie to get it on with an attractive [[Winston Ndugu|former colleague]] of hers, likening conferences to the Olympic village. Later, she had drinks with [[Cormac Hayes]] and witnessed how he lost his temper with a rep from a company. He then excused himself. While sitting at the bar by herself, she was surprised to see [[Claire (Love of My Life)|Claire]]. Claire sat down with her and they shared updates on their lives since /. They then touched upon Allison, whom Teddy said she missed every second of her life. Teddy then brought up her daughter. Claire found it odd for her to have named her daughter after Allison. Teddy claimed it wasn't odd to name your child after your deceased best friend, but Claire revealed she knew about their affair. Teddy said it tore them up. Claire said she requested Allison's phone records after she had died to imagine her in her last moment and she found out that Teddy was the last person Allison had tried to call as the Towers fell. Overwhelmed by emotion, Claire left the bar. Teddy met up with Maggie for breakfast the next morning. When she spotted Claire, she went to apologize for the affair and the lying. She stated she had come to learn that a person could love two people at once. Claire accepted her apology, saying she could never stay mad at someone for loving Allison. Afterward, Teddy attended Richard's talk on his PathPen, which turned into complete nonsense. Afraid that he was having a stroke, Teddy went to call an ambulance while Maggie got Richard off the stage.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy became part of the team trying to figure out what was going on with Richard. Between that and Tom, she forgot about wedding cake tasting with Owen. As she walked with Tom, who jokingly suggested for her not to marry Owen, they came across [[Dana Hamilton]], Tom's ex-wife, who wanted him to operate on her son, [[Guthrie Hamilton]], who bore a striking resemblance to Tom and Dana's deceased son David. Teddy figured the surgery to remove spinal mets was too much pressure for Tom so she paged Amelia to take over. Dana struggled to accept the change as she had absolute confidence in Tom's abilities. Tom, however, claimed his schedule was too busy rather than tell Dana the truth. Teddy checked in on Tom later. He told her that he had always convinced himself that he would have been able to save David if they had gotten to the hospital in time, but now that he had the opportunity to save someone who looked so much like David, he couldn't even stand to be in the same room, meaning the thought that he could have saved David had just been a lie. During the surgery, Amelia started experiencing contractions so Tom was forced to step in. He froze right after taking over so Teddy coached him from the gallery to find his confidence again. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy comforts Tom.]] Tom pulled off the surgery and retreated to his office afterward, where Teddy came to find him. He thanked her for what she had done for him that day. She apologized for causing him pain but he said she had taken away more than she was adding. She briefly held his hand until she pulled away and left. She ran into Owen on her way out. He pulled her into a supply closet and they started to make out. Trying to bury her feelings for Tom, she asked Owen to get married that very weekend.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy didn't tell Tom, who was hurt upon finding out the truth when Owen confronted him about not granting him time off. He feigned happiness for her. Later, they ended up on an elevator together and he brought up her wedding. She stated she loved Owen and didn't want to discuss it any further. He guessed moving up the wedding was her way of trying to convince herself she could live without him. Teddy responded that the wedding was happening but Tom openly doubted that. Teddy answered a page from Tom, who asked her not to throw her life away. She still insisted the wedding was happening. Tom told her he still loved her and wouldn't give up on her. He told her he would wait for her in the parking lot at  o'clock, ready to take her wherever she wanted to go. Teddy objected but gave in as Tom started kissing her, which brought her to finally confess that she was in love with Tom, too. Unbeknownst to Teddy, she accidentally called Owen, leaving him a voice mail message of her and Tom having sex. While doing so, Teddy told Tom that this was goodbye and that she would still be marrying Owen. She went home and put on her dress for the wedding, but as she went to the living room for the ceremony, she found Evelyn taking down decorations. Teddy was surprised when Evelyn told her that Owen had called to inform her he got pulled into a last minute surgery and that the wedding would have to be postponed.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nOwen and Teddy met while they both were army surgeons. Owen brought her to Seattle Grace Mercy West as a present for [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], claiming her to be a \"cardio goddess\", and Teddy later worked out that Owen brought her as a present for his girlfriend, appearing more surprised by the fact Cristina was his girlfriend. She later would admit that she believed that if Owen broke up with his fianc\uee, Beth, he would have called her. She knew what Owen was going through with his PTSD, but she wasn't able to help him because she was seeing Mark at the time, and he was with Cristina. During the shooting, Owen finally decided that he wanted to be with Cristina, which Teddy understood. This ended their romantic feelings for one another, and they continued being best friends.\n\nYears after Teddy left the hospital to move to Germany, Owen realized that he wanted to be with her and flew out to Germany to visit her. They slept together and spent a day blissfully happy. However, their happiness was cut short when Teddy learned that Owen had come because of Amelia's suggestion after he had slept with Amelia the day before. Teddy kicked Owen out, and two left things on bad terms.\n\nMonths later, Teddy returned to Seattle with the news that she was pregnant with Owen's baby. Though Owen was initially mad that Teddy had hid her pregnancy from him for so long, they eventually made up and decided to raise the baby as friends. After Owen broke up with Amelia again, he started therapy and realized he was actually in love with Teddy. Teddy realized that she was also in love with Owen just as she went into labor with their baby. As she was giving birth to their daughter, [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], Owen declared his love for her. After a few months of raising Allison together, Owen proposed to Teddy with his mother's ring and she accepted. During the snowstorm, Teddy and\ua[[Tom Koracick]]\uaslept together. They slept together and had a romantic relationship for weeks leading up to the wedding of Owen and Teddy. Owen finally found out after Teddy dropped her phone in Tom's office and a voicemail of Teddy moaning was heard by the OR. Owen later listened to the voicemail in full and cried in a supply closet. He called off the wedding.\n\nWhile Teddy was dealing her trauma and loss of Allison, Owen apologized to her for the way he treated her when she tried to tell him the truth about her relationship with Allison. They reconcile as friends.\n\nLater on Christmas, Owen proposes to Teddy again and she accepts.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nDr. Sloan asked Teddy out, but she initially declined. Eventually, she accepted and they had dated briefly.\uaAfter finding [[Reed Adamson]] in Mark's bed, Teddy ended things.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref>\n\n[[Henry Burton]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy realizes she loves Henry.]]Henry was a patient who had Von Hippel-Lindau disease (making tumors grow in areas with rich blood supply) and could no longer afford treatment because his insurance capped out. Teddy met Henry in an elevator in the hospital, where Henry asked her if he would have a chance when he asked his girlfriend to marry him. Teddy told him his girlfriend would be a fool to say no. She later bumped into him again, and he informed her his girlfriend said no. He then revealed that he primarily asked her because of her insurance. Teddy then offered to marry him, as she had a great insurance as a surgeon.\n\nAfter their marriage, Henry listed Teddy as his emergency contact person, because he didn't have any friends or family left. Henry developed real feelings for Teddy, but he decided not to tell her. She started dating, and they discussed her dates over the food she always brought home for him. However, when Teddy started a relationship with [[Andrew Perkins]] for the second time, Henry couldn't keep his feeling still anymore. He told her how he felt, which made her doubt about her relationship with Andrew. Right before she would leave for Germany with Perkins, she choose Henry over Andrew and kissed Henry.\n\nHenry told Teddy that he wanted to go to medical school, but Teddy didn't want him to go. When Teddy went home that night, she tried to make up with Henry, but found him coughing up blood. Henry had a tumor on his lung and needed surgery. When Cristina and Richard opened him up, they found that there was no chance of saving Henry and he started to code. Webber stepped in to do CPR, but after  minutes, it was a lost cause so he stopped and Henry died. Webber told Owen not to tell Teddy as she was in surgery, and then they would lose another patient, so Owen told Teddy that Henry survived. Finally, after the surgery, Cristina told her that her husband was dead. Teddy demanded to see him and then broke down in tears.\n\n[[Andrew Perkins]]\nAndrew and Teddy began a relationship after the shooting at Seattle Grace Mercy West. Andrew was the main trauma counselor who had to approve and clear each surgeon for surgery. Teddy and Andrew met in the\uacafeteria and dated for a few weeks before he had to move onto his next case. Teddy was very upset by this, but eventually moved on. Eventually, Andrew returned to Seattle, but in the meantime, Teddy had married\ua[[Henry Burton|Henry]]. Andrew was offered a permanent position in Germany and asked Teddy to go with him. She initially accepted and they were all set to go. However, she had second thoughts about her relationship with Henry and chose to stay.\n\n[[Tom Koracick]]\nTom and Teddy started dating after she came back to Seattle to raise her child with Owen. Though Tom initially had worries about Teddy's relationship with Owen, she convinced him that she and Owen were only meant to be friends. Tom stayed very involved with Teddy's pregnancy, including attending birthing classes with her. Tom even helped Teddy find the perfect apartment in Seattle. Tom often fought with Owen over Teddy, as both men wanted to help Teddy with her pregnancy. When Teddy went into labor and had an emotional moment with Owen, Tom was not alerted and was left at home building a crib for the baby.\n\nShe broke up with him after giving birth and chose Owen. Later on, despite being engaged to Owen, Teddy had a playful snowball fight with Tom and went to his house that night. They kissed and shut the door. Later, they kissed and locked the door again in Tom's office.\n\n[[Allison Robin Brown]]\nTeddy met Allison when Allison nearly ran her over with her bike. They hit it off and Allison bought Teddy a bagel and asked Teddy to move in with Allison and Allison's girlfriend, [[Claire (Love of My Life)|Claire]], but she and Allison began an affair together after that, whilst Teddy was grieving the loss of her mother.\uaTeddy later described\uaAllison as her\ua\"favorite person.\" Allison died on / in the second tower and her death left Teddy feeling like she couldn't stay in New York. She ended up joining the Army because of that feeling. Years later, Teddy and Owen named their daughter after Allison.\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nOne day, Arizona took Teddy aside and told her that they should be friends. Teddy and Arizona shared a special friendship. When [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] asked Teddy out, she confided in Arizona, who suggested that Mark was like candy: eat it and forget about it. When things sparked between Mark and Teddy, Arizona was the one she confided in. When Arizona went to Africa, she and Teddy continued to keep in touch and regularly wrote to each other. Arizona supported Teddy when she had things going on between her and [[Andrew Perkins|Andrew]].\n\nWhen [[Callie Torres|Callie]] became pregnant and asked Arizona to be in, Arizona went to Teddy for advice on whether or not to be in. Arizona arranged ladies night for her after Henry died. Arizona and Teddy continued to keep in touch after Teddy moved to Germany, as Arizona learned about Owen double-dipping from her phone conversation with Teddy. \n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nInitially excited at the prospect of a new cardio attending, Cristina was disappointed when she learned that Teddy had not inserted a pacing wire for about  years and began to question Teddy's skills as a surgeon.\n\nHowever she became very impressed by Dr. Altman soon after Teddy diagnosed a child with cardiac asthma after only a brief exam and asking three questions, and when she opened him up, she discovered he had a coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula, which she repaired surgically and allowed Cristina to first assist, which meant allowing her to attach the coronary artery to the aorta. Following his removal from bypass, the patient went into v-fib and started bleeding from the repair site. Teddy remained extremely calm and talked Cristina through resolving the rhythm and repairing the site without rearresting the heart.\n\nOver the course of their time together, Teddy and Cristina developed a deep sense of respect for each other as colleagues, despite the slight tension between them caused by Owen. Teddy, who grew to appreciate Cristina's skills and persistence, almost regularly had Cristina on her service.\n\nThey once performed an appendectomy together, during which both of them forgot what to do halfway through the surgery. Cristina told Meredith and Alex that Teddy is\ua\"the love of my life\" because they got along so well.\n\nWhen Teddy's husband, [[Henry Burton|Henry]], came to the ER while vomiting blood, he had to undergo laparoscopic surgery, and Teddy believed only Cristina could perform the surgery like herself. Cristina was kept in the dark about the identity of the patient, and she performed the surgery. At one point in the surgery, there was too much bleeding, and Dr. Webber suggested they open him up. After they opened him up, Cristina saw there was too much damage to the aorta\uaand realized she couldn't do anything to save him. Dr. Webber continued to do compressions even after Henry's heart stopped. Cristina was then told by Owen about who the patient was and she broke down crying in the scrub room.\n\nNot long after that, she was forced to enter the ER where Teddy was operating to assist in that surgery. Teddy was unaware that Henry had died. After the surgery was complete, Cristina had [[April Kepner|April]] close while she took Teddy into the scrub room and told her that Henry had died.\ua[[This Magic Moment|For two weeks]] after Henry's death, Teddy questioned Cristina over and over again about what exactly happened in the surgery. Cristina kept describing the whole procedure without complaining, until Teddy concluded that Cristina did everything that could have been done.\n\n\nDr. Altman attended [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School]], completing her [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[George Washington University Medical Center]] and her fellowship at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Florida.\n\nWorking previously at [[Columbia University Medical Center]]\uaas a [[Board Certification#American Board of Thoracic Surgery|board certified]] [[Attending|attending surgeon]], Dr. Altman left her job following the death of her best friend, who was killed during the collapse of the second tower. Upon leaving her job, Dr. Altman joined the army and met [[Owen Hunt]] during her tour in Baghdad. She also served two years in Landstuhl.\n\nWhen her tour of duty was over, Owen recommended her as the new interim [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. The then-[[Chief of Surgery|Chief]], [[Richard Webber|Webber]] initially offered her a temporary contract, but she became part of the permanent staff when Dr. [[Derek Shepherd|Shepherd]], the new chief of surgery, extended her offer with a new contract.\n\nAs head of cardiothoracic surgery, Dr. Altman mentored [[Cristina Yang]] for the last three years of Yang's residency and began research on a stem cell regenerative heart medicine project. It was this research that drew the US Army Medical Command's attention toward Dr. Altman, eventually offering her the position as their [[Chief of Staff|chief of staff]]. After Chief Hunt fired her in order to facilitate the decision of leaving for her, she left the hospital and accepted the position at MEDCOM.\n\nShe came to\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]\uaafter\ua[[Megan Hunt]]\uawas found. Teddy now\uaholds privileges at the hospital since operating on Megan\uawith\ua[[Meredith Grey]]. After finding out she was pregnant, Teddy traveled to Seattle again and was pulled into an emergency surgery with Bailey, whom she asked for a job. Surprisingly, Bailey offered her the job of [[Chief of Surgery|Interim Chief of Surgery]], which Teddy was very interested in. However, she later turned it down after learning that Owen had formed a family with Amelia. Later, after she told Owen and decided to remain in Seattle so their baby could have two parents, Owen gave her his job as Head of Trauma Surgery. She began missing operating on non-traumatized hearts and was hired as Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery again by [[Tom Koracick]] when [[Maggie Pierce]] quit. Shortly after, [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] was closed down and Maggie was re-hired at Grey Sloan, making her and Teddy Co-Heads of the department.\n\n\n*Teddy has birds on her scrub cap. Owen revealed that Teddy's best friend loved birds and died during the collapse of the second World Trade Center tower.\n*She drives a Volvo V\n*Teddy was awarded a Bronze Star for her service in the military.\n*Teddy had plans to leave the hospital every season during her first run as a main cast member, finally leaving at the end of season eight.\n**In [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season six]], she almost left because she couldn't handle that Owen wasn't in love with her.\n**In [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season seven]], she was planning on moving to Germany with Andrew Perkins, but stayed because Henry told her he was in love with her and she was starting to fall in love with him too.\n**In the [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season eight]] finale, she was offered a job in the army, but refused to take it because she wanted to stay in Seattle to support Owen, as he was having a hard time. However, Owen didn't want her to miss the opportunity just because of him, and forced himself to fire her. After she was fired, Teddy was angry at first but relieved later, and she took the job, leaving Seattle Grace Mercy West.\n*Though she was part of the main cast from season six to season eight, and seasons fifteen to present, season seven is the only season in which she appears in every single episode.\n*Teddy is either bisexual or pansexual, since she got involved with her friend, [[Allison Robin Brown|Allison]].\n*Although the cardiothoracic surgery department has had more different department heads than any other department over the course of the entire series, Teddy is the only head of cardiothoracic surgery to have been fired.

He was formerly [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], but quit after leaving his fianc\uee, [[Cristina Yang]], during their wedding. After winning a Harper Avery, he founded the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]], and ran it until he gave it to Cristina.\n\n\n\nPreston grew up in Alabama, where his mother owns a restaurant.\n\nBefore going to his high school prom, he was very nervous because he didn't know how to dance. He asked his uncle, who is good at dancing, to help him. His uncle agreed and taught him a few basic moves. He stayed up nights before the prom practicing his dance moves because he wanted to impress his date. On the night of the prom, it all worked out and he didn't step on his date's feet while dancing and she said that he was a wonderful dancer.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\n\nHe completed his pre-medical studies at [[Tulane University]] where he pledged Kappa Alpha Psi and went on to graduate first in his class from [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]]. While in college, he met [[Erica Hahn]], who graduated in second place after him, beginning a rivalry between them.\n\n\nWhen he was at Mercy West fighting for a heart for Denny, he rushed to the hospital to help Denny right away. Then he got shot in the shoulder before entering the hospital. The wound caused damage to the nerves in his arm and caused him to develop a tremor. He took a long time recovering, but he eventually regained use of his arm and hand and he was able to operate again.\n\n\nPreston was in the mood for a traditional, spirited wedding, which rose conflict with Cristina. In the end, they agreed to have a spirited wedding, but only a small one. The news of the wedding was supposed to be secret, but Mark overheard Preston telling Derek, and soon everyone knew.\n\n\nAfter the wedding, Burke was nowhere to be found. When Cristina asked Derek about him, he told her Burke had handed in a letter of resignation two weeks ago.\n\n\nPreston Burke was one of the  and  applicants for the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. He was against many applicants, such as [[Erica Hahn]]. He won following his departure from Seattle Grace.\n\n\nFollowing his [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery]] win, Preston Burke sought out his next challenge. Connecting with a billionaire investor, Preston founded the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] in Zurich, Switzerland with a focus on cardiac research. As its [[Chief of Staff|chief medical officer]], Preston managed and worked in the institute for some time until he gave it to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] in order for him to move to Milan, Italy at the request of his wife.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe is a brilliant surgeon, however, he is sometimes overbearing, especially when it came to his relationship with [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]. He is extremely neat and organized, particularly when it comes to [[Burke's Old Apartment|his apartment]], which is spotless. He is an excellent cook and plays the trumpet. \n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nAt the mixer before the interns' first day, Cristina approached Burke but he ignored her and was too interested in his date.\n\nHe began a relationship with intern [[Cristina Yang]] but broke it off because he feared it would ruin both of their reputations. However, her miscarriage brought them back together. They lived together in his perfectly-kept apartment. However, after being shot he started to have tremors and they were forced to keep them secret putting a strain on their relationship. After a long time of keeping his tremors a secret, Cristina went to the Chief and confessed everything. Initially, he was engaged in a cold war with Cristina, where neither of them spoke but after she broke the silence, he proposed to her and she accepted.\n\nHowever, on the day of their wedding, Burke told Cristina that he no longer wished to make her do anything against her will, and Burke realized he was trying to make Cristina the woman he wanted her to be rather than accepting her as the woman she is. Cristina said she \"thought this was what she wanted.\" He wanted her to say she ''knew'' it was what she wanted, so he left her in the chapel. Cristina then returned to their apartment and discovered Burke had left, taking with him the things that meant something to only him (his trumpet, his Eugene Foote collection, his grandmother's picture, and his lucky scrub cap), leaving Cristina devastated. He told Derek to inform her he quit and sent his mother to collect his things.\n\nYears later, despite having moved on and created a family, Burke evidently still had feelings for Cristina, knowing full-well if he were to work with Cristina again, he would inevitably fall for her again to the point of cheating on his wife  with Cristina and ultimately \"destroy [his] marriage and [his] life\".\n\n[[Edra Burke]]\nBurke is currently married to Edra Burke, with whom he has two children: Simone and Vivianna. Edra has sacrificed her career for their family so Burke could run the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]], but in , Burke gave his job to Cristina so he and Edra could move to Milan in order to be closer to her parents.\n\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nAlthough Burke initially disliked George, he began to like him and later, George became ''his guy''. George even moved in with him for a while but was kicked out when Cristina walked around naked. Burke was friendly towards Derek for a while but he wasn't ''friends'' with him. He even befriended Addison first. After a bomb scare at the hospital they became good friends. He even chose Derek to be his best man. He was good friends with Richard Webber as well.\n\n\nDr. Preston Burke used to be the [[Attending#Department Head|head]] [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] on a salary of $ million. After completing pre-medical studies at [[Tulane University]], Burke graduated first in his class from [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]]. He completed his [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\nHe was once the interim [[Chief of Surgery|chief of surgery]] while Dr. Webber was healing from brain surgery.\n\nHe was once shot, affecting his control of his right hand. His temporary fix to this possibly long-term problem was to work together with Cristina during every one of his surgeries so that she could take over in case he might have trouble with his hand. The arrangement fell apart after Cristina, reacting to growing stress after George caught onto their secret, went to the Chief and confessed everything. The chief was quite angry at Burke telling him that many patients are at risk and it is a major problem that his hands are not able to function perfectly. The chief referred to Burke's hands as being worth  million dollars.\n\nUntil their secret was revealed, Burke was set to become the next Chief of Surgery, but now he has to compete with his fellow attendings for the position. He recovered full use of his hand after being operated on by [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]].\n\n[[Image:Preston-burke-wins-award.jpg|left|thumb|px|Burke wins a Harper Avery.]]\n\nAfter he left Cristina at the altar, Preston's long-time rival, [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Erica Hahn]], replaced him as the head of cardiothoracic surgery. She has some respect for Burke, but was infuriated when he won a [[Catherine Fox Award|medical award]] instead of her.\n\nFollowing his [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery]] win, Preston, with the help of a billionaire investor, founded the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] in Zurich, Switzerland with a focus on cardiac research.

He performed surgery to remove the pacemaker on his musical hero at Foote's request, but against Burke's better judgment. Unfortunately, Foote died during surgery.<ref>[[Blues for Sister Someone]], x</ref>\n*Burke was the only cardiothoracic [[Transplant Surgery|transplant specialist]] at Seattle Grace<ref>[[ Seconds]], x</ref>, a role presumably taken over by [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Hahn]] upon on his departure.\n*When casting for Burke, he was described as a nebbishy, stout forty-something man.\n*In the alternate reality episode [[If/Then]], Preston Burke is one of the missing characters, though it is explained that he had a romantic relationship with [[Cristina Yang]] and abruptly left the hospital shortly after.\n*Burke believes his scrub caps are lucky and he feels nervous about surgery without them.\n*During season one, despite being a cardiothoracic surgeon, Burke oversaw, and ultimately performed, an appendectomy. Additionally, he was planned to perform a Whipple. Both procedures are typically performed by a general surgeon, however Burke is likely to have been certified in general surgery before completing his cardiothoracic fellowship.\n*In , Preston Burke was a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic]] [[Fellow|surgical fellow]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].<ref>[[Shake Your Groove Thing]], x</ref>\n*In the season seven episode [[Shock to the System]], a former patient of Burke is hospitalized.

Please?|'''Nicole Herman''' to '''[[Arizona Robbins]]'''}}\n\n'''Nicole Herman''' was the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Fetal Surgery]]\uaat [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\n\nDr. Nicole Herman was first seen when she talked to Arizona about a shared patient. She repaired the U.T.O. at  weeks and when she went to check on the baby, the parents could not stop singing the praises of Arizona, while she only did a few little stitches when the baby hit the air. Nicole brought up the open fellowship spot and suggested that Arizona should apply so that she could learn something that's actually hard, rather than taking the credit for other people's hard work. Arizona objected that she too did really hard things in peds, but Nicole wasn't convinced.\ua''(\"[[I Must Have Lost It on the Wind]]\")''\n\nWhen Arizona started her fellowship, Nicole immediately began assigning extra research and work to her. When she struggled to keep up, Nicole reminded her that everything in the womb happens at super-speed, so she needs to learn to keep up. ''(\"[[Got to Be Real]]\")''\n\nNicole continued teaching Arizona and an OB/GYN resident,\ua[[Graham Maddox|Dr. Graham Maddox]],\uain a very strict and severe manner. She noted Arizona's impeccable record and good relationship with her peers, but treated her strictly as her fellow, for example not letting her join in on a personal conversation. She granted Arizona the chance to perform a solo fetal surgery, but upon noticing Arizona wasn't as well prepared as she expected her to be, she gave the opportunity to Graham. She later took Arizona aside and informed her that she was letting her down, causing her to start doubting Arizona's operating skills and even her own teaching skills. Herman told her that if she messed up again, she would fire her as her fellow as she did not have the time to wait for Arizona to catch up.\ua''(\"[[Bend & Break]]\")''\n\n\nNicole told Arizona that she had an inoperable brain tumor and only had six months left to live. She wanted to use this period of time to teach Arizona about Fetal Surgery since it is a new field and all the knowledge she held wasn't found in any textbooks. ''(\"[[Don't Let's Start]]\")''\n\nAfter telling Arizona about the tumor, she left it up to Arizona to decide if she wanted to continue to learn from her or if she wanted to turn her into the board, which would mean that the fellowship would go away. While Arizona was trying to decide, Herman left her in charge of the department as she had an appointment. At the end of the day, Herman returned to the hospital. She noted that Arizona had done exactly what she should have done in Herman's absence and confessed that she'd been getting radiation therapy. After this, Arizona agreed that she wouldn't tell the rest of the board and would continue to learn from Herman. ''(\"[[Could We Start Again, Please?]]\")''\n\nWhen Amelia informed her that she believed she could remove the tumor, Herman initially rejected the idea, because she'd been given hope many times before and then had it taken away. However, after Arizona confronted her and said that she was throwing away a chance that [[April Kepner|April]] and [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] would love to have for their baby, she relented and agreed to hear Amelia's plan. After hearing it, she agreed to have the surgery, but only after the tumor grew as large as it could get and still be removed in its entirety. She insisted on that even when Amelia insisted that it needed to be removed as soon as possible. ''(\"[[Where Do We Go From Here]]\")''\n\nWhile Amelia developed her surgical plan, Herman created an intense crash course intended to teach Arizona as much as possible in the time they had left. ''(\"[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]]\")''\n\nHerman and Arizona continued their crash course over the next four weeks. However, earlier than they expected, Herman started to experience fuzziness at the edges of her vision. An MRI revealed that the tumor had invaded her optic chiasm, meaning it was time for her surgery. She was taken immediately to the OR and sedated for surgery. ''(\"[[Staring at the End]]\")''\n\nAmelia operated and despite some complications, she successfully removed Nicole's tumor. However, she didn't wake up for several days after the surgery, leading Amelia to look for a cause. An MRI showed signs of a stroke and Amelia worried she'd never wake up. Despite this, she did eventually wake up. She was fully aware of her surroundings and showed no loss of mental faculties, but she was completely blind. She told Arizona that she was grateful that she got to figure out what was next for her because Arizona pushed so hard to get her to have the surgery. ''(\"[[The Distance]]\")''\n\n\nAfter being discharged from the hospital, Herman went to the Blind Institute, where she learned to live her daily life as a blind person. She sent Arizona a text that said, \"Enjoying Blind Institute. Learning how to not bump into things. Not typing this obvi. Don't kill any babies.\" ''(\"[[I Feel the Earth Move]]\")''\n\nAfter finishing \"Blind School,\" Nicole went dark over the loss of her ability to do surgery, to save lives. Then she looked at all the things Arizona was doing and realized she could teach and that could matter. She could save even more babies that way. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\nNicole returned to Seattle when she had a series of headaches over a month. Amelia worried that her tumor had returned, even after a CT looked clear. However, she ordered a spinal tap to rule out CSF leak. After the tap instead confirmed it, Amelia said she'd need a shunt, but Amelia didn't want to do the surgery herself, because she had operated on Nicole before under the influence of a tumor. Nicole revealed that she knew about the tumor because of [[Tom Koracick]] and still wanted Amelia to do the surgery. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\n\nEx-Husband\nShe was married but is now divorced. She mentions that while they were married, she was involved in many boards and committees, things that were important to him. She quit all that later because it wasn't important to her.\n\n[[Tom Koracick]]\nAfter becoming blind, she had sex with Tom. She said that sex when you're blind is even better. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nShe seems to have had a rather close professional relationship with Arizona Robbins, teasing her about the fact that fetal surgery is even harder than pediatric surgery.\n\nHowever, when they began working together more closely, they bonded and became more friendly, with Arizona even spending several nights in the hospital with Herman, who was staying there during their crash course.\n\nAfter Nicole left to go to what she called \"Blind School,\" she lost contact with Arizona, though she continued to follow Arizona's professional work. They made up when Nicole returned to the hospital and offered to use her grant money to open a center for women's health with Arizona. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nShe and Amelia were shown discussing [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Dr. Addison Montgomery]]'s new life as a mother, indicating they know each other both personally and professionally. Both practice the surgical specialty of [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]] and are renowned in [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]].\n\n[[Graham Maddox]]\nWhile he was rounding on her service, she started a sexual relationship with Graham. She said he was a nominal surgeon and a complete tool, but was a satisfactory sexual partner.\n\n\nDr. Nicole Herman was the\ua[[Attending#Department Head|Head]]\uaof\ua[[Fetal Surgery]]\uaat\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. After an\ua[[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]]\ua[[Resident|residency]], she completed a\ua[[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]]\ua[[Fellow|fellowship]]\uaand eventually sub-specialized in\ua[[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]], a brand new field of medicine that she's basically inventing as she operates.\n\nOne of the few fetal surgeons in America, Nicole trained\ua[[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]]\uaas her fetal fellow, and\uaOB/GYN resident [[Graham Maddox|Dr. Graham Maddox]] who regularly rounded\uaon her service. Her excellent reputation as a fetal surgeon\uamade [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] the go-to hospital for fetal surgeries in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAfter she became blind following the surgery to remove her brain tumor, Nicole was left unable to operate and resigned.\n\nAfter leaving surgery, she got a faculty position at UCSF, teaching fetal surgery. She got a grant from HHS and decided to use it to open a center for women's health along with Arizona, saying she could teach and Arizona could perform fetal surgery and make the country safer for women and babies. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\n*She is the first known\ua[[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgeon]]\uawho's part of the staff of Grey Sloan Memorial. It's been since\ua[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\uaworked at Seattle Grace Hospital that a fetal surgeon part of the hospital's staff was shown, as [[Emma Marling|other fetal surgeons]] were only visiting.\n*She is the fourth hospital staff member to suffer from cancer, being preceded by\ua[[Elizabeth Fallon]], [[Richard Webber]], and\ua[[Izzie Stevens]].\n*When [[Emma Marling]] turned down the [[Two Against One|open maternal-fetal surgeon position]], it may be that Herman was hired instead.\n*Herman wore a personalized scrub cap that was gray themed with black leopard spots.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[I Must Have Lost It on the Wind]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[Got to Be Real]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[Bend & Break]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[Don't Let's Start]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[Could We Start Again, Please?]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[Risk]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[Where Do We Go From Here]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[All I Could Do Was Cry]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[The Great Pretender]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[Staring at the End]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[The Distance]]\nxNicoleHerman.png|[[Cold as Ice]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Nicole Herman Appearances}}[[de:Nicole Herman]]\n[[fr:Nicole Herman]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Herman, Nicole}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

On the first date, they had sex and Joan got pregnant. Because of the baby coming, they decided to stay together and get to know one another.\n\nJoan went into labor one morning. The doctor said she could wait, but she insisted that Keith take her to the hospital right away. He wanted to take the bridge, but she insisted on the tunnel, because it's faster.\n\n\nWhile they were driving in the tunnel, it collapsed, crushing their car and trapping both of them. The rescue workers were able to extract Joan and take her to the hospital, but Keith remained trapped in the car.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], [[April Kepner|April]], and [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] came out to the scene as a team and started to evaluate Keith and look for options to treat him and keep him alive so they could get him out of the car. They suspected a collapsed lung and put in a chest tube. He also had a piece of the car penetrating his abdomen. They did what they could to stop the bleeding and then stepped away to discuss options. Since none of the options were really workable, April said he was a black tag. There was nothing more they could do. She sent the other three back to the hospital and said she'd stay while they cut Keith out and do what she could for him.\n\nThey were then surprised when April showed up at the hospital with Keith still trapped in his car. She said that she couldn't just leave him to die, so she figured out a solution that gave them more time. ''(\"[[Time Stops]]\")''\n\n\nOnce he arrived at the hospital, they doctors began to discuss how they'd get Keith out. [[Hal]] and his team began to cut away at the car, but they had to stop when Meredith realized it was ripping Keith up from the inside out. So they stopped and decided to start the exploratory laparotomy outside and clamp off everything they could before rushing him inside to repair the damage. Keith began to express doubt that he'd live through it, so Meredith talked to Alex and they brought Keith and Joan's son outside to see him. When they took the baby away and got ready, Keith said it was a bad idea, because now that he'd seen his son, he'd be pissed if\uait didn't work and he died. The doctors then sedated Keith and got to work. Owen and April clamped off every bleeder they could and then rushed him inside, where a path to the only available OR, a plastics OR, had been made. He coded in the elevator on the way up, but they were able to restore sinus rhythm in the OR before continuing the surgery.\n\nAfter his surgery was completed, he was awake and stable in a room with Joan, who was also stable and awake. ''(\"[[You're My Home]]\")''\n\n\n\nKeith is engaged to [[Joan Paulson]]. They had sex on their first date and Joan got pregnant. Because of that, they decided to stick it out and get to know each other during the pregnancy.\n\n\nKeith has one son with Joan, who was born in an elevator while Keith was trapped in his car.\n\n\n*He says Joan liking techno music would normally have been a dealbreaker, but he stuck it out because of the baby.\n*He and Joan both like watching tennis, but not playing.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxKeithGardner.png|[[Time Stops]]\nxKeithGardner.png|[[You're My Home]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Keith Gardner Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gardner, Keith}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She was a sleepwalker and once in college, she woke up having sex.\n\n\nWhen Cristina was in the hospital after the plane crash and wasn't speaking, she and Shane stood outside the room, talking about her until she threw a vase at them, scaring them off. ''(\"[[Remember the Time]]\")''\n\nEarly in her internship, Heather slept with [[Alex Karev]] because she has social anxiety and having sex is easier than talking. ''(\"[[Second Opinion]]\")''\n\nWhen Cristina came back from Minnesota, she dubbed Heather \"Mousey,\" a nickname that stuck, and Heather quickly decided she liked her. ''(\"[[Second Opinion]]\")''\n\nWhen Arizona Robbins returned to work, Heather was assigned to follow her with a wheelchair in case she needed to sit down. ''(\"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\")''\n\nWhile secretly consulting Meredith about patients, Heather overheard that the hospital was being sold for parts. She then passed the news on to the other interns and to Bailey. ''(\"[[This is Why We Fight]]\")''\n\nWhen the hospital bought a LODOX to do full-body scans with smaller amounts of radiation, Heather offered to test it out to find a marble she stuck up her nose as a child. Eventually, they did use it and found the location of the marble. ''(\"[[Idle Hands]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek was told he needed to teach interns other than [[Shane Ross]], Heather was assigned to his service. Derek was initially annoyed by her need to chatter in the OR, which she did because she was nervous, but he was impressed by her reflexes. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\nHe continued to mentor Heather, though she was initially reluctant. She was upset to be removed from the case of [[Kayla Wayne]], who had been sawed in half, in order to work on a patient with Moyamoya disease. ''(\"[[Do You Believe in Magic]]\")''\n\nDerek figured out that Heather chattered throughout their surgeries to coverup the fact that she lacked confidence in her natural talent and he took it upon himself to build up her confidence. Later, while they were placing a stent in [[Paul Dawson]], Derek was informed that Meredith had fallen down the stairs and was going to OB to get checked out. Heather assured him that the hard part was over and she could finish without him. ''(\"[[Readiness is All]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the superstorm, Dr. Shepherd told Shane to find Brooks. When he bumped into Brooks, he told her to go and search for Dr. Webber, which Dr. Bailey told him to do. Brooks went into the generator room, searching for Dr. Webber and saw him suffering from electrical shock. She ran to help him and stepped into a water puddle, which had electricity running through it causing her to be electrocuted. Just before she fell, her head hit a generator box and she collapsed. When Shane found her, he and Derek rushed her into surgery. Although\uathey repaired her subdural brain bleed,\uashe died on the table due to too much swelling in her brain. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n\nDespite the fact that she died before she finished her internship, a personalized lab coat was accidentally made for her which Shane found in an empty cubby when the interns moved into the residents' lounge.\ua\n\n\nHeather Brooks was overly energetic and enthusiastic about nearly everything, and because of this her more serious fellow doctors found her to be annoying. Heather was known for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time and being utterly awkward to no end. She was also a bit sarcastic in nature and often told weird, sometimes unsettling jokes. Although sometimes endearing, Heather was not well-liked at the hospital and upon her death, her fellow interns could not think of one nice story to tell her mother. Instead, they told stories stolen from Meredith about George and their own experiences with each other. They did, however, admit to being upset over her death. Heather was also compassionate and caring, proven by the fact that she frequently treated the poor and uninsured under the table in the ER. She had a gift for neuro.\n\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShe had a brief sexual relationship with [[Alex Karev]]. She said she found having sex easier than talking, so it made her less nervous around him.\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nWhen she replaced Dr. Ross on Shepherd's service, Derek took a liking to her. He would often try to make her feel confident in her natural ability and talent as a neurosurgeon. He also encouraged and embraced her weirdness.\n\n\nHeather was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. It was noted by [[Derek Shepherd]] that she had a natural talent for [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgery]] and he began to cultivate that talent by mentoring her, though she was not as enthusiastic about it as Shepherd hoped. Brooks, as he pointed out, often acted weird to cover up her lack of confidence in her natural ability, though after Heather finished the surgery on [[Paul Dawson]] on her own with full confidence, Derek told her to \"stay weird.\"\n\n\n*She ate dirt as a child.\n*She had social anxiety.\n*Her last words were: \"Oh crap! Dr. Webber!\". She said them when she found an unconscious [[Richard Webber|Richard]] on the floor in the hospital basement.\n*Cristina Yang wouldn\ut call her by her name up until her death. She therefore referred to her as Mousey referencing to the  dwarves; even though there wasn\ut a dwarf named Mousey. Yang finally called her by her real name while talking to Owen expressing that she was sorry about her death. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n*She stuck a marble up her nose when she was six. Its location was revealed\uaby the \"LODOX\", a scanner that is able to make a full body scan in  seconds.<ref>[[Idle Hands]], x</ref>\n*She was roommates with [[Leah Murphy]].\n*When she was young, she had an imaginary brother who went everywhere with her.\n*She sometimes cried during sex.\n*Although most of the doctors didn't appreciate Heather's personality, Derek took an instant liking to her.\n*Although she was already dead at that point, she was issued her own [[Scrubs|lab coat]] with her name embroidered on it normally reserved for residents who have passed their [[United States Medical Licensing Exam#Step |intern exam]].\n*Heather treated many unhoused and uninsured patients \"under the table\", meaning she didn't charge them for her time or the medical supplies she used on them. This is reminiscent of [[Izzie Stevens]] as she treated [[Ahn|a patient]] \"under the table\" early in [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|her intern year]]. [[Shane Ross|Shane]]\uahas since taken them in to honor her memory.\n*She appeared in Shane Ross's flashback in the OR while operating on [[James Evans]]\uaduring [[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], of how he sent her to the basement, which caused her unexpected death.\n*She was quick on her feet and had good reflexes, especially compared to Shane.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Going, Going, Gone]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Remember the Time]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[I Saw Her Standing There]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Beautiful Doom]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Second Opinion]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Love Turns You Upside Down]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Run, Baby, Run]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Things We Said Today]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[The End is the Beginning is the End]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[The Face of Change]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Hard Bargain]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[This is Why We Fight]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Transplant Wasteland]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Idle Hands]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[She's Killing Me]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Do You Believe in Magic]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Readiness is All]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Perfect Storm]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Seal Our Fate]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[I Want You With Me]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nPromo.jpg\nPromo.jpg\nPromo.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n:'''[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]:''' Brooks, thanks.

Ben, who was with her, wanted to take her to the hospital, but she didn't want to chance being caught in the car in the rain, so she said she'd just have the baby at Meredith's house. Everything was going well until Ben did a pelvic exam after her water broke. He was able to feel the baby's foot and the cord, which had no pulse. April insisted that Ben do an emergency c-section at the house. Using a kitchen knife and with help from Arizona over the phone, he delivered the baby. They were then taken to the hospital. After April was out of surgery, she held her newborn baby. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\nLater, as April healed, Catherine came to visit and held her new granddaughter. April then informed her that they had named the baby Harriet. Catherine loved the name, but disliked it when April told her the baby's last name wouldn't be Avery. Jackson later told her they were hyphenating the last name. ''(\"[[Undo]]\")''\n\n\nBefore Catherine's surgery, Harriet was brought to see her. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- Pandemic, Harriet became sick. Her mother tested her for COVID and it was negative, so her parents suspected it was RSV and gave her acetaminophen to relieve her symptoms. By the next morning, her fever had broken and she was feeling better. ''(\"[[Look Up Child]]\")''\n\n\nHarriet came back to Seattle with her parents when Catherine was getting chemotherapy and the Grey Sloan Memorial surgical residency program was at risk of being shut down.

She returned ten years later with a repeat aneurysm.\n\n\n\nKatie competes in pageants and her talent is rhythmic gymnastics. She seems to be quite good at it as she was ranked highly in her pageant.\n\n\nKatie, while competing in a pageant, fell, hit her head, and sprained her ankle. She told Meredith about it as she was pushed around the hospital when Meredith got lost.\n\n\nKatie was later brought to the hospital after having multiple seizures. The cause of the seizures was a mystery, so Derek recruited the interns to help him figure out the cause. Cristina and Meredith paired up to find the solution. While they were going over research and discussing various options, Meredith had an epiphany. She remembered Katie telling her about her previous fall. She believed that fall had burst an aneurysm. Derek had doubts, but agreed to check. He ran a scan and found out that Meredith was correct. Katie was bleeding into her brain, which caused the seizures. Meredith scrubbed in with him and they operated. ''(\"[[A Hard Day's Night]]\")''\n\n\nTen years after her first surgery, Katie returned to the hospital after passing out at work with transient weakness and headaches. She was upset because she asked for Dr. Shepherd and got Amelia instead of Derek. A CT showed a new aneurysm, much larger and more dangerous than the first one. Her surgery went well despite the danger and she had no neuro deficits. Afterward, she asked Meredith what happened to Derek and Meredith just said it was a long story and told Katie to take care of her brain. ''(\"[[My Next Life]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing to determine if she would lose her medical license, Katie was among those who testified on her behalf. She talked about being treated by Meredith on her first day as a doctor. She said Meredith was green but the only one who could figure out what was wrong with her. Since that diagnosis allowed her to continue to live her life and have a baby girl, she wanted to give Meredith a little help in return.

They lived into adulthood without being separated, but as adults, they looked into separation. They decided against it initially because Pete was scared of the risks, but then six months later, they reconsidered because Jake had fallen in love with [[Elena]] and wanted to be able to be with her without his brother coming along. They'd had a fight over Pete taking Elena's side in an argument and Pete accidentally touching Elena while she and Jake were having sex.\n\nThe doctors set up dummies that represented Jake and Pete and practice the surgery. [[Derek Shepherd]] thought the surgery was too risky, but he was convinced to go ahead. Despite a problem during surgery, each of them had two functioning legs and were successfully separated.\n\nAfterward, in recovery, Elena came to see Pete, but he was disinterested in her. He was put in a room with his brother and they started to make-up with each other, holding hands when their beds were pushed together.\n\n\n\nHe had feelings for his brother's girlfriend, [[Elena]].

I deserve it and if any one of them has the misguided impression that there is any choice at all in this matter, I will set that person on the righteous path before he or she can reveal him or herself as a moron.|'''Miranda Bailey'''}}\n\n'''Miranda Bailey''' is a [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] and the former [[Chief of Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She is married to [[Ben Warren]] and has one son, [[William George Bailey Jones|Tuck]], with her ex-husband, [[Tucker Jones]]. During her internship at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], she was very quiet and had no confidence, until she was mentored by [[Richard Webber]]. While in her residency, she was known as ''The Nazi'' to her interns, due to her tough and no-nonsense personality. However, she later dropped the nickname after operating on a real Nazi.\n\n\n\nAlthough Bailey has rarely spoken about her childhood, she has said that growing up she liked ''Star Wars'', took dance classes, played the oboe\uain the school band, and believed in Santa until the age of eleven.\n\nShe did not attend homecoming because the boy she liked never asked her out.\n\nHer mother (Elena) was very protective of her because she had lost another daughter before Miranda Bailey.\n\n\nAt the beginning of her internship, she met [[Debbie]], a nurse at Seattle Grace, who taught her how to be respectful to patients, as well as superiors and her fellow interns. She also told Bailey to not \"piss off the nurses\", and warned her of the consequences if she did so.\n\nWhile working on a patient about to have open-heart surgery, she became increasingly cranky and ordered Debbie to get her coffee. Debbie got her coffee, but she got her revenge and had Bailey do scut for an entire month.<ref>[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]</ref>\n\nHer first solo surgery was an appendectomy during her intern year on Alicia Tatum, but it turned out Alicia's appendix was perfectly healthy. Alicia was a mystery; every test they did on her came out negative. She was sent home but came back, and Miranda diagnosed her with porphyria. She scolded Dr. Baylow for being careless, and Richard sent\uaher to his office. He made it look like he was angry with her, but he actually told her she was going to make \"a hell of a surgeon\".\n\n\nHer reputation as \"The Nazi\" preceded her as her interns were seen nervously discussing her after learning about their assignments on their first day of work.<ref>[[A Hard Day's Night]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey kept her pregnancy news private from others, as she didn't want to get her personal life caught up in her professional life. She later admitted the pregnancy to Chief Webber, after he asked her about whether or not she was accepting a fellowship at Seattle Grace.\n\n\nThe position of Chief Resident was initially given to Dr. Torres. The Chief justified his decision by saying he didn't want Bailey to get caught up in the paperwork, and that she was too good a surgeon for that. Bailey was not entirely happy with his decision. After seeing Callie struggling due to the situation with George, Bailey elected to be her number two. She called the shots for the day, helping the residents with their patients and the doctors with their problems. Chief Webber realized that she was the one doing the amazing work, and as such gave her the position of Chief Resident.\n\n\nAt first, Bailey disliked Peds, because she couldn't see kids suffer, as it reminded her of her son, but after working with Arizona on a case, Arizona said she was perfect for the job. It took some time for Bailey to notice, but Peds was in her interest. When Bailey considered a pediatric surgery fellowship, her then-husband Tucker gave her an ultimatum: him or the job. She decided to leave him but also didn't accept the fellowship because she was becoming a single mom.\n\n\nDuring the point in time when Izzie Stevens, her former intern, and resident, was diagnosed with stage  melanoma that had spread to her liver, skin, and brain, Dr. Bailey was with her all the way, as her doctor and her friend. When all of her friends, and her new fianc\ue, Alex Karev, were too afraid to go visit her, Dr. Bailey was supportive, and a very motherly figure to Izzie. At one point, before her very risky surgery, Izzie gave Bailey a green knitted scarf which she had made during her cancer treatment. She gave it to Bailey because Bailey had supported her throughout her cancer treatment.\n\nMeredith discovered that their John Doe patient was actually George O'Malley. He was later pronounced brain dead in surgery. Everyone was devastated, especially Bailey, who said that she needed to stop caring so much because it was interfering with her life.\n\n\nBen and Bailey started going out after Miranda's divorce. Miranda had some inhibitions, as she had only ever had sex with her ex-husband, she had a child, she was divorced, but Ben didn't care. Ben was as headstrong as Bailey and they balanced each other out, but she was busy putting herself back together with \"tape and glue\" after the shooting, so they broke up, following the revelation that Ben was out golfing the day the shooting happened so he wouldn't have memories of that day.\n\n\nBailey had a fling with a headstrong male nurse by the name of [[Eli Lloyd|Eli]]. Ben told her that he thought she wanted him to wait for her after she broke up with him and that she was unclear. She ended things with Eli and resumed her relationship with Ben.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter agreeing to move in together, Ben invited Bailey to lunch, but she got paged on a once in a lifetime case. They fought while she was operating and she found out he wanted her to do the crossword puzzle. She dropped everything to show him how childish it was and said the crossword was too easy. She got to a -letter answer with the clue: My question to you. He revealed that he made it and it took months to do. He was asking her to marry him. Later, she came to him in nothing but a trench coat and thong and proposed to him, but they didn't immediately get engaged because Ben told her he was offered a surgical internship at UCLA.\n\n\nWhen she heard that there was a plane crash, she brought Zola to Meredith. When they were on the plane, which was transporting her, Richard, and the sedated plane crash victims to Seattle, she said that she wished they sedated her too.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey was very nervous about this wedding, as she'd been married and divorced before. Her wedding got delayed because of Adele Webber, who had undergone emergency surgery, which was performed by Bailey. Ben didn't mind waiting for her. Much later than expected, Miranda and Ben got married.\n\n\nThree of Bailey's patients returned with post-operative infections. It was initially believed to be the fault of [[Leah Murphy]], who was ill but assisted on Bailey's surgeries.\n\nHowever, following the arrival of the third patient, whose surgery Dr. Murphy had not assisted on, it was apparent that the problem was more serious and the CDC was alerted.\n\nFollowing the investigation, it was deduced that Dr. Bailey was contaminated with MRSA, an aggressive infection which resulted in the deaths of all three patients.\n\nThe infections were transmitted due to the replacement of surgical gloves instituted via Pegasus policy, which possessed microtears.\n\nFollowing the investigation, Dr. Bailey became reclusive and refused to operate, testing herself repeatedly for MRSA. It was only when Meredith was critical post-natally did she step in and save her.\n\n\nFollowing her experience with MRSA, Bailey was more cautious in surgery. This came to a head when her husband, [[Ben Warren|Ben]] quit his surgical residency to return to [[Seattle]] to be with his family.\n\nAfter Bailey was informed of this, she began to show signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) which caught her husband's attention.\n\nWhile casually speaking to Derek he mentioned that her condition could be affecting patient care. Derek, being a member of the board, was required to investigate and report these claims, which he did with the help of Owen.\n\nThey came to the conclusion that she was unfit to continue performing surgery and required psychiatric help. [[Dr. Alma]], an occupational therapist, was assigned to shadow her and clear her when she deemed Dr. Bailey ready.\n\nAfter the first two days, Dr. Alma tested Bailey's control over her condition and recommended that she take the medication she had been prescribed.\n\nAfter a conversation with [[Richard Webber]], Bailey finally agreed. The medication was effective and she was cleared to return to surgery.\n\n\nWhen Owen decided to step down as Chief of Surgery, Richard told Bailey she'd become his successor. Catherine refused to just appoint Bailey right away and demanded that she be tested against an outside candidate of Catherine's choosing. Upon hearing that, Bailey stated she felt sorry for the other candidate because she'd wipe the floor with them.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nHer confidence took a hit when the candidate turned out to be\ua[[Tracy McConnell]], who immediately proved to be very capable and popular with the other doctors. Ben convinced her not to back down. Bailey gave her speech in her OR and told the board members that she deserved the job because she'd do anything to make the hospital the best it could be, while it'd only be a temporary project for Tracy, who jumps from challenge to challenge. The board members voted and Bailey was appointed Chief of Surgery.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey initiated the Code Orange when she heard that Alison was raped by Keith, and they had not been having consensual sex. When there was an explosion, and Meredith, Arizona, and Eliza were blocked from entering the hospital, Bailey cleared them, saying that fire trumped rapist on the loose. She later helped with the evacuation and was surprised to see Nathan, who was in the OR, just exiting the hospital when they evacuated the OR ages ago. After Eliza forgot to alert the police about Stephanie going missing, Bailey fired Eliza, saying that the hospital doesn't produce surgical robots. They produce human beings who know when not to follow the rules too strictly, which she came to realize Eliza couldn't do.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Ben told her that he was going to be a firefighter, Bailey began to ignore him and their relationship was strained.\n\nOn the day of her son's school presentation, Bailey went to Seattle Presbyterian Hospital and told the [[Julia Udell|nurse]] that she was having a heart attack. She was admitted and [[Intern Stuart|Stuart]], an intern, said that she wasn't showing any signs of a heart attack and that the test results looked fine as well. Later, [[Larry Maxwell|Dr. Larry Maxwell]] arrived and asked if she was having any stress, but Bailey told him that it wasn't because she was a woman who can't handle her feelings. She requested for a cardiac stress test and a second opinion, but Maxwell ignored her and asked her some other questions instead.\n\nAfter Bailey called Maggie to come over to Seattle Pres, [[Rich Gregory|Dr. Gregory]], a psychiatrist, believed that her condition was psychological rather than\uaphysical, but Bailey refused to play into that theory. Maggie and Richard arrived and found Bailey doing CPR on a [[Morgan|coding patient]]. As soon as she was done, she collapsed and they had to take her to surgery. Bailey was doing well for a while, but her pressure dropped and Maggie inserted an intra-aortic balloon pump. Maggie\uaasked Maxwell if he did a cardiac stress test and began to argue with him over Bailey's care because if he did the stress test, he would have seen the condition before it became emergent. Maggie then planned to perform a keyhole procedure. Before Bailey was put under, she asked for Ben and said that she needed her husband.\n\nAfter surgery, Bailey woke up. Ben arrived at the hospital and explained to Bailey that he quit his job at the fire station. Bailey told Ben to call his boss back and said that working as a firefighter was terrifying, but life was terrifying and was too precious to waste doing anything less than what makes him happy.\n\nWith Richard and Ben at her side, Bailey called her mother\uaElena and told her she had a heart attack and that it was scary, but she was okay. Elena knew she was because she was her Mandy.<ref>[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn the morning of Jo and Alex's wedding, Bailey received a big check from the TrailBlazer. She and Ben were among the guests to follow a faulty GPS link, landing them at the wrong location and wrong wedding. When the bride's mother collapsed, Bailey and Ben took her to the hospital. Bailey got some scrubs and had Vik page whomever from cardio was on call. Everyone on call was all busy, but as a gift from God, [[Teddy Altman]] appeared with her luggage. She just arrived from Germany. Bailey had her scrub in so they could repair her abdominal aortic aneurysm. In surgery, Bailey talked about how her being at the wrong wedding saved this woman's life, only mere months after she nearly died herself. She changed her lifestyle to a more healthy one, but she did resume her life as if nothing had happened. Upon learning Teddy wasn't there for the wedding, Teddy revealed she had come there looking for a job, but Bailey didn't respond.\n\nAfter the successful surgery, Teddy apologized for putting her on the spot, but Bailey said it was just one more sign that it was time for a sabbatical from the Chief job. She wanted to have time to innovate and fall in love with the OR again and spend more time with her loved ones. She had tried to ignore the voice of the patriarchy in her head telling her she couldn't rest because she was a woman, but she decided to listen to her own voice and take the sabbatical after all. She then offered Teddy the position of interim Chief. Teddy was interested, but their talk was cut short when Ben came to say it was time for a wedding. They organized a wedding in the chapel for the couple whose wedding was cut short by the collapse of the bride's mother and set up a video chat so the mother could watch the ceremony from the ICU.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey had adjusted her lifestyle to a healthy one.]]\nThe next day, Bailey found Teddy waiting for her in her office. Teddy had decided she wouldn't be staying in Seattle after all and therefore wouldn't accept the job. Word got out and throughout the day, several attendings put their name in the mix for the job.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nAs she showed him her innovative hyperbaric medicine lab, new Head of Ortho [[Atticus Lincoln]] helped her realize that she didn't want someone too good to replace her so that she would be missed and welcomed back with open arms. Bailey then spent the day in the hyperbaric chamber to get away from people pitching themselves for the job. Meredith found her and brought up Jo's plan to create a surgical innovation fellowship for her. Since she spent quite a lot of money on the hyperbaric chamber, the hospital couldn't afford both to hire Alex back and fund the fellowship. Bailey later witnessed Jackson put the hyperbaric chamber to good use to debride [[Nisha|Nisha's]] wound in there for a better outcome. However, Nisha passed away due to an infection.\n\nRichard later visited Bailey in her office and she explained to him that she wasn't giving him the job because she didn't want to add to his plate with his struggles after Ollie's death. After he left, Jo and Alex came back and Jo pitched why she was the future of medicine. Bailey was impressed and saw a solution to all her problems. She hired Alex back and appointed him interim Chief and decided to fund Jo's fellowship with her own money from the TrailBlazer. That also meant she would be running the fellowship instead of Meredith, which was the perfect opportunity to find both joy and tranquility.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey ignores her fellow to fix Alex's messes on his first day.]]\nNo longer being Chief took some adjusting, like losing her personal parking spot. She checked in with Alex and both tried to hide their nerves, but Alex assured her he had this and told her to go de-stress. She assured him that she trusted him with the job. Alex had messed up the OR schedule, so Bailey fixed that and invited Jo to scrub in with her so they could discuss her fellowship. However, Bailey kept hearing that the nurses had been understaffed during first shift, so she ran out to fix that. She ignored the research Jo sent her and went to the Chief's office to verify some of Alex's work. She found he had spent the entire quarter's budget on his first day. Bailey stayed and helped him to rectify his mistake, but she was starting to think that having him replace her was a mistake.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Bailey and Maggie took care of [[Natalie Forrester]] and her family, who had been brought to the hospital by Andy, Ben, and Dean. She found out that Ben had a burn, which he tried to hide from her. She was not amused. She later cleared Andy and Dean to take off, which was required per a new policy and chastized them for letting Ben damage his surgical hands. Bailey later watched [[Evan Forrester]] say goodbye to his wife while his son Max was still in the dark. Despite Evan's misguided attempts to spare Max from the pain, Max had found out that his mother was dying and he ran off into the city.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nPlagued by worries over Ben, Bailey couldn't sleep, so she got to work early and started working on Jo's idea for cancer killer cells. She wrote whiteboards full of possible approaches, which they had to narrow down to fit them all in one year. Alex came to fetch her and Jo for a surgical consult on [[Nina Sullivan]], who had a yet-undiagnosed cause of abdominal pain and came to the hospital for Meredith, who was out for the day. Bailey and Jo convinced her they were as good as Meredith and after a thorough work-up and a process of elimination, they figured out the diagnosis and resolved the problem surgically. Later, Jo found Bailey in their lab. Bailey told her that she had applied the process of elimination to her own life, too, to remove stressors from her life, but she was still stressed. She then suggested Ben's new job was the source of her stress.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, she found a paper detailing Ben's death benefit at home. At work, she flourished as a mentor to Jo. They revived a liver from a deceased donor using normothermic perfusion. Alex ordered them to shut it down since it wasn't UNOS-approved and a failure could risk their standing with the organization, but they performed the procedure behind his back because case reports from Europe had Bailey convinced it would work. They did not face any consequences because the procedure was successful. Throughout the day, she had sent Ben worried texts since she - again - had not heard from him all day, but all of them were left unanswered. Privately, she measured her blood pressure, which was way too high. She then texted Ben that they needed to talk on his next day off.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Bailey tells Ben she wants a marriage sabbatical in hopes that it would lower her stress levels.]]\nShe took a day off so they could spend his day off together. While she wanted to talk, he was happy that they could spend the day together and they had sex. Afterward, they had breakfast on the couch and she talked about how seeing Jo and Alex balance their work-life with his being Chief reminded her of her and Ben. He knew it had been hard on her since his job change and said it was time for them to re-connect. He was wondering what they could do to do that, but she couldn't ignore what she had to say any longer. She told him that stepping down as Chief hadn't helped to lower her stress and blood pressure. She told him that worrying about him and if he would come home at night was not helping. She needed a break from that, too. She explained that she needed time to get well and work on herself. She promised she wasn't trying to see other people or keep him from Tuck, but she hoped that she would stop worrying about whether he would come home or not if she knew that he wasn't coming home. While he thought that that was just the first step to a divorce, she desperately told him that she needed to try because she couldn't breathe every time she thought about him getting hurt. She was afraid that being married to him was killing her. He packed a suitcase and she assured him that it wasn't final. He left after kissing her goodbye.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite their sabbatical, Ben returned to the house to board up the windows in preparation for the windstorm. With Alex unable to make it to the hospital, Bailey briefly resumed her role as Chief. She benched Richard upon hearing that he had been arrested after demolishing a bar. She made a speech in the ER to announce that they were a brick house that the storm couldn't blow down and that they would stay open for traumas. The crowd applauded and she was glad to see she still got it. Richard later vented his concerns to her that Catherine was having an affair with Tom Koracick. Bailey scoffed at the idea and then informed him of her own marriage sabbatical. He said the worrying wouldn't stop because she asked Ben to stay away. He told her that fixing the inside from the outside wouldn't work and that she needed to get real help. Afterward, Bailey joined Taryn on an elevator to take [[Phoebe Moss]] up to the OR to procure her organs for [[Cece Colvin]]. However, a power outage trapped the elevator between floors.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nBailey and Taryn had to keep each other calm and stop themselves from catastrophizing while ventilating Phoebe manually. She started pulling her fingers again. Eventually, they were rescued by [[Jed Lundberg]] and Jackson. They had to climb out and took Phoebe to the OR. During the procedure, Alex came to inform them that Jed's legs had been crushed when the elevator started working again mid-climb. Bailey ordered Alex to take over for her so she could go help him out and lead the hospital. Alex later found her in his office and told her she could have her job back if she was going to treat him the way she did. She told Alex that she was in crisis and didn't trust herself to finish the procurement. She then received a reassuring text from Ben to tell her he was safe and she broke down crying. She then begged Alex not to quit as she needed more time to straighten things out. He agreed to help her with whatever she needed.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nRichard telling her she needed to seek help led her to go back to her therapist. Faithfully doing her exercises, she made progress and began noticing again when she was pulling her fingers. At work, Teddy asked her for a job again, but Bailey directed her to Alex. Bailey and Maggie later watched Catherine's last surgery before her own spinal surgery from the gallery. Maggie practiced talking about her feelings with her and said that Catherine, Jackson, and Richard were delaying the inevitable by not talking about the tumor. Bailey told her the storm would come when it did, which was part of her exercise to stop trying to control things she couldn't control. The storm came after surgery. Bailey wanted to enter a lounge, but Maggie stopped her from going in because Catherine, Richard, and Jackson were fighting in there.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref> Everyone came to terms with it and they made up for the surgery. Bailey sat down with Richard in the gallery and stayed with him during Catherine's surgery. When the surgeons had to flip Catherine on the table, Richard couldn't bear to look at the risky move, so Bailey informed when it was over.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nBailey and Ben remained separated through the holidays. Ben dropped off presents for Tuck on Christmas Eve. She had also written Ben's name on the presents she had got Tuck herself, but she promised to also give him Ben's gifts. He told her he was on call on Christmas, so they might see each other in the pit. On NYE, Bailey contemplated calling Ben but decided against it as it might seem like a booty call. A few weeks later, they ran into each other in the ER and she followed him outside. She told him her heart was ready for him to come back. She felt lonely without him when Tuck was at his father's and the fence needed some repair work. He told her she had broken his heart, so he wouldn't come home for the fence. She then told him that she was focusing so much on her physical health since the heart attack that she had neglected her mental health. Her meds needed to be adjusted, which is why she had been off. She told him she was being treated, but he didn't respond and left for an emergency. A few days later, on Valentine's Day, she came home and found Ben working in the front yard. He told her that she had told him to follow his bliss, but then she turned on him and left him over it. If he were to come back, he needed to know that that would never happen again. He said he should have realized something was wrong with her and brought up that he never followed through on building her the treehouse, which she asked for as a place to de-stress. She then noticed he was building her that treehouse and promised she would never call time-out on them again. They went inside and celebrated Valentine's Day in the bedroom.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nWith her home life back on track, Bailey grew increasingly impatient to get her job back, but there were still two months to go. She noticed that Alex had started a weekly free breakfast for the interns to boost morale. Much to her dismay, she discovered that a display with pictures from all past and present Chiefs had been installed in the cafeteria, with Alex's picture last. The pictures continued to bother her. She told Richard that Alex was praised in an article for the hospital's innovation while that was actually all her doing. Richard told her that's how it goes sometimes and shared a story of how she performed emergency surgery on a long-time patient of his, who now sent her a basket of pears every year. However, as soon as he was gone, she switched her picture with Alex's. At the end of the day, she tried to get Alex to give her her job back, but he had become good at it and insisted on finishing out the contract. Begrudgingly, she told him she was proud of him for standing up for himself like she had taught him.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith was breaking the hospital's longest surgery record, Bailey helped out in the ER with the mass overdose victims. When Betty was discovered amongst the teenagers, she was diagnosed with an aortic dissection. Teddy decided to operate and Bailey forbade Owen from tagging himself in. At the end of the day, Ben and Bailey left together. Bailey said the world is a scary place, no matter how well you raise your kids. Ben told her to focus on the beauty of the world with him for a moment.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]],x</ref>\n\nOn the night of Catherine's party, Catherine enticed Bailey to drive there in the back of a limo with her. Bailey had been warned Catherine might try to ditch her party, but she couldn't resist the party. Bailey appreciated the luxury and Catherine pointed out she had the money to buy nice things for herself outside of taking care of business, like fixing the garage door and paying off her car and property taxes. Bailey was reluctant to indulge because she didn't know how the TrailBlazer would be a success, but Catherine told her that money comes and goes and you need to let yourself enjoy it before it's gone. She convinced Bailey to buy the expensive C TurboMix, pointing out the joy it would bring her. Catherine then had the limo pull over. She didn't want to go because people would congratulate her like it was all over, but she was not cancer-free. She didn't want to celebrate living in constant dread. Bailey told her she needed to learn to spend joy like she had learned to spend money. She shared that she no longer trusted her heart and might drop dead tomorrow. But they were alive and people loved them, which was cause enough to celebrate. As soon as they arrived, the guests gathered for a speech, but that was interrupted by Owen and Tom's fight and a supposed fire in the kitchen. Everyone was evacuated. Ben responded to the call and after the penthouse was cleared, he offered Bailey a ride home on the aid car.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWith  days left on the contract, Alex had Bailey cover the ER since both Owen and Teddy were out on personal days. She told him she was looking forward to no longer having to take orders from him.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey disapproves of the research approved by Alex.]]\nWith her resuming the position coming closer, Bailey started to look into the DeLuca research on external gestational sacks that Alex had approved. She thought it was an ethical slippery slope and she hated that she would have to handle in a few weeks. She advised Alex to look into Vincenzo DeLuca's mental health issues. Later, she ran into [[Helen Karev]] in the cafeteria and during their chat, Helen revealed she had extended her stay because she was scared of flying back and didn't dare to ask Alex for help. Bailey later informed him of this. Alex thought she was on a crusade against people with mental illness, but she pointed out she was someone with mental illness herself, so she knew how hard it could be to ask for help. She needed help herself not too long ago, which is why she asked him to stay on as Chief. Later, Alex asked Bailey to take over as Chief for  days so he could fly back to Iowa with his mother.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> Still able to relax shortly before taking back over, Bailey spent the day playing Tetris in one of Maggie's mood rooms. She took a short break to quiz a math whiz on math problems.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nOn Bailey's last sabbatical day, she and Ben found out that Tuck was \"just talking\" to a girl named Kelly. As they dropped him off, they saw him put his arm around her. Ben and Bailey took a break after he dropped a patient off at the hospital and she said they needed to talk to Tuck about respect, consent, and condoms so that he could properly enjoy his butterflies and first love. Ben offered to take that off her plate as his father gave him the talk and it worked. Bailey later stood among the wall of women to support [[Abby Redding]].<ref>[[Silent All These Years]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey guides STEM students around the hospital.]]\nOn her first day back, she paged Alex because she couldn't find the compliance reports for the medical board, which were due tomorrow. He had no clue what she was talking about and left. Levi then also dumped a few STEM students on here, who were to learn about leadership, something she had approved months ago. As she guided them around the hospital, they ran into all kinds of awkward situations and people yelling and making mistakes. She apologized to the students and proposed they reschedule for a less hectic day, but they told her they had learned a lot from the way she handled the situations. She then also discovered that Alex had been handing off paperwork to the interns. She later showed Richard the results of that. They both thought it was an amazing idea, but they agreed Alex could never know they did.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Tucker found out that Tuck was also calling Ben \"Dad,\" he had some angry calls with Bailey. Meredith asked her for advice on how to tell her kids that she was dating Andrew, which Bailey already knew about from Richard. Bailey told her that kids already know on some level and advised her to just make sure they knew she still loved them and that she was not going anywhere. Bailey settled the \"Dad\" issue by telling Tuck to call Ben by his name again as it hurt his father's feelings. Later, she comforted [[Warren Sterman]], a long-time patient of hers, as he grieved the death of his grandson, caused by a mistake by [[Nico Kim]].<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nBailey identified [[Lucas Ripley]] when Levi arrived with him at the hospital. Later, she was approached by both Ben and Teddy with concerns about Jo's wellbeing. They went to look for her and found her sobbing in [[Lori Carter|Lori Carter's]] arms. While Ben comforted her outside, Alex told Bailey that Jo had come back from Pittsburgh a changed person and that he didn't know what to do with her.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey and Catherine have a meeting about Meredith's insurance fraud.]]\nWhen the Olympia United Medical Group discovered the insurance fraud committed by Meredith, their representatives held an emergency meeting with Bailey and Catherine. They went over the case together all day and paged Andrew to ask for details on the case.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref> Andrew took the fall for Meredith, after which he was arrested. Bailey then found Jo lurking outside the room. She asked her if she could work today because many attendings were out and her star resident was just arrested. Jo said she could. Bailey and Catherine then settled the [[Gabriella Rivera]] case by telling [[Luis Rivera]] that the Foundation would pay for everything. After the meeting, she informed Richard of what Andrew had done, after which he ran off instead of joining her to the ER. As Bailey and Jo waited for an ambulance together, Jo told her they needed to talk later. Bailey and Richard operated together and she shared her suspicions that Andrew was just covering for Meredith and that he hadn't pulled it off by himself as he was too smart not to realize he was risking every employee's insurance and the Rivera family's asylum.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith informs Bailey and Catherine on what she did.]]\nAs soon as she got herself out of the hyperbaric chamber, Meredith went to Catherine and Bailey and told them the truth. Alex and Richard came in to back her. They failed to report it but they couldn't bring themselves to put Luis through any more misery after everything he had been through. Bailey then fired all three of them. At the end of the day, Bailey watched as Jo checked herself into the in-patient psychiatry ward. As they walked off, Alex asked her if he was still fired, to which she replied it hurt her more than it did him.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nWith her three top attendings fired and DeLuca in jail, Bailey had to get Owen for an incoming trauma despite his daughter just having been born. A week later, she witnessed as Catherine took Tom into a private meeting. Another week passed by and Bailey found out that Catherine had hired Tom as her Foundation's Chief Medical Officer, meaning he would oversee all of the Catherine Fox Medical Centers' Chiefs, including Bailey. Bailey thought Catherine would stand by her. Catherine pointed out that doing so had created a big rift between her and Richard. She found she had less energy than before the cancer, so all small problems would be taken to Tom now instead of to her. Bailey was angered. Andrew showed up with a cocky attitude, knowing she needed help, which didn't help to calm her down. She spent a full week being angry, which exhausted her. She ran into Teddy in a lounge, who confessed she hated maternity leave and vented her fear that she was a bad mother. Bailey told her she had hated maternity leave, too, and that she was an excellent mother.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nTom's promotion left her without joy at work so she indulged in doughnuts instead of her usual green smoothies. Ben gave her a pep talk to go find herself joy. She had noticed the residents had been sulking around since she fired the three attendings, so she reminded them that she shaped Alex and Meredith into the surgeons they are today and offered to shape them, too. She gathered the residents for the case of [[Wade Foltz]], who needed an axillary-bifemoral bypass, and organized a skills lab for the toughest part of the procedure, promising that whoever finished first with good results would get to do that part in the actual surgery. Andrew beat out Taryn by mere seconds but Bailey chose Taryn instead. She also offered Jo full control over her fellowship to prevent her from quitting and accepting the same offer from Alex at Pac-North. Bailey hushed Andrew when he objected in the OR and later made him step in when there was bleeding from the suture line. Afterward, Bailey spotted Meredith in the waiting room with [[Robin (Season )|Robin]] as they went to check on Wade. Later, Andrew confronted her about sidelining him, suspecting she did so because of his relationship with Meredith. She clarified she wanted to give Taryn a taste of the adrenaline and fear that makes you a surgeon and warned him that he was making this personal. She suggested he think about his career and let go of certain loyalties. At the end of the day, Jo came to tell her she had considered her offer but wanted to be appointed attending general surgeon instead, using Alex's counteroffer in her negotiation. Bailey approved and hired her. At home, she told Ben about having found joy that day and how Tom was shocked in the nads by Owen, which made her laugh.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Shirley Gregory]] came in for her ALPPS procedure, Bailey showed confidence in Jo by letting her perform the procedure under her supervision despite Jo only ever having observed it. However, Shirley only wanted to be operated on by Meredith, so Bailey had to agree to let Meredith follow the procedure through video chat to get Shirley to consent. Bailey had to assist to repair a bleeding but Jo pulled it off successfully. Bailey hung up on Meredith as soon as Jo was done. Afterward, she found a disappointed Dahlia crying in a hallway and found out that Dahlia resented her for firing Meredith, who was the sole reason she, like many others, had worked so hard to get herself matched to Grey Sloan. Understanding Dahlia wasn't open to learning from anyone else, Bailey fired her so she at least had something in common with her hero.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a patient refused to be treated at Grey Sloan and was taken to Pac-North, Bailey learned that Meredith had published an article that trashed Grey Sloan. Bailey considered this a public attack and discovered it had sent the residents into mayhem, including the Chief Resident quitting on her. She appointed Andrew as Chief Resident to clean up the mess his girlfriend had made as he had failed to warn them about it before it came out. Bailey felt very hot and Jo suggested that her heart was in distress because of the stress caused by the article. Worried she might be right, Bailey fetched Maggie for a cardiac work-up, which revealed her heart was fine. Maggie suggested it was hormonal and drew blood to run a full panel. Knowing her mother went through early menopause, Bailey got emotional and asked Ben to sit with her and allow her to feel her feelings. Later, Meredith came by her office and told her that she had not meant for the article to come out like this. She said she had just pitched some ideas and the website published it this way, while she had never directed any comments towards the hospital itself, but rather at the medical system as a whole. Bailey shut down Meredith's suggestion to write a retraction since they never get read. Meredith stressed she would never attack her beloved hospital that taught her everything. Bailey recalled the many hours she had sacrificed from her family to be a mentor and friend to Meredith and said Meredith could apologize all she wanted but that the damage had been done. She asked Meredith to leave. Maggie later came by with her blood results. Bailey was indeed perimenopausal but also pregnant, which came as a shock.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nBailey tried to tell Ben about the pregnancy when he came home from an exhausting shift but he fell asleep as soon as he lay down on the bed. At work, Bailey took the case of [[Carly Davis]], who had a carbon monoxide poisoning from a suspected suicide attempt. Jo recognized Carly from her residential treatment and joined her and Bailey in the hyperbaric chamber. Bailey learned Carly was in fact one of her therapists, which resulted in Jo panicking and having shaky hands, which was ironic as Carly was the one who taught her tricks to keep her nervous system calm. Jo applied the techniques, including reciting a list of things you know by heart, but it didn't work. She feared she would never completely get better if even the person who helped her out of her depression could still attempt suicide. As she started to spiral, Bailey blurted out she was pregnant, which helped to calm Jo down. As Carly slowly improved, Jo asked her about the pregnancy. Bailey informed her Ben didn't know yet. She further said the pregnancy wasn't planned and that it terrified her but could also make her happy. Since Bailey started to panic, Jo had her recite Tuck's bedtime routine as a baby, which surprisingly helped. After solving Carly's case, Bailey offered to take the case off Jo's hands but Jo wanted to see it through. Bailey told her she watched Jo teeter on the edge, bring herself and Bailey back from that, and saved Carly's life in the process, which all told her Jo would be okay. After learning that the carbon monoxide poisoning had been an accident, Jo established a boundary and handed the case back to Bailey. Later, Bailey informed Ben she was in an emergency. He rushed to the hospital and found her. She eased his panic and told him about the pregnancy. While shocked at first, he was delighted and picked her up to twirl her around. In his excitement, he told some nearby staff.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nAround Halloween, Bailey's hormones started to get the better of her. She didn't want to cry at work, especially in front of Tom. She cried when Tuck sent her a picture of his costume. She also had cravings and started to think about how breastfeeding, which she had read was recommended now, would interfere with her career. She took her concerns to Amelia, who taught her some tricks to hold back tears. She worked on a case with Teddy and Tom. Teddy was worried that she was a bad mother because she hadn't provided amazing self-made costumes for her kids. Bailey assured her no one equated good costumes to good parenting and advised her to just focus on spending time with her kids. After the successful surgery, Bailey confronted Tom about his continuous complaining about Halloween. He apologized and shared with her the story of how Halloween was his and his son David's thing and how David died a few weeks before he could ever put on his Stormtrooper costume, which just hung on David's bedroom door for months as Tom couldn't bring himself to take it down. While Amelia's tricks had helped her throughout the day, she couldn't stop herself from sobbing. Tom awkwardly comforted her. Afterward, Bailey went to see the parade in the peds ward and learned that Teddy had dressed up her babies as zombies, which made Bailey suggest she buy costumes next year.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Bailey and Ben bask in joy as they look forward to meeting their baby.]]\nThe firefighters at [[SFD Station |Station ]] threw a surprise celebration for Ben and Bailey's baby, where Bailey learned that [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] was seeing [[Victoria Hughes|Vic]]. [[Travis Montgomery]] gave a speech to congratulate the pair though he ruined it by calling it a late-life pregnancy. While enjoying the food, they went around the table with each firefighter stating a wish for the baby. Afterward, Bailey and Ben lied down on top of the engine and talked about their baby possibly being a girl. She told Ben she felt safe there. She liked knowing there are heroes out there in the dangerous world and knowing them personally.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA few days later at Meredith's trial, Bailey was surprised to see that most of Meredith's former colleagues showed up to support her. While testifying, Bailey denied being close to Meredith and stated that Meredith lost the qualities that had made her promote Meredith to Head of General Surgery. She also confirmed a list of incidents involving Meredith to be true. She found out Richard had cheated the system to get Meredith a spot at Seattle Grace and she scoffed as Richard later took the blame again for Meredith's tampering with Derek's Alzheimer's trial during his testimony. During a break, she confronted him and he reiterated that it was his decision to make. She pointed out he had a habit of going around the system for Meredith no matter the consequences. Richard thought he was jealous but admitted he gave Meredith special treatment due to his history with Ellis, making him consider her family. Bailey said they could have come to her for help. Richard thought that would have led to Catherine firing her. She finally told him that their actions had cost her her hospital with Tom being in charge now, her best surgeons, and most importantly, her closest friend. She admitted she felt betrayed by someone she raised. He pointed out her testimony made him feel the same way as he thought she'd stand up for Meredith as he had.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey finally testifies on Meredith's behalf.]]\nAfter the break, Bailey barged into the room and talked about how Meredith had been breaking the rules since day one, and even though she deserved to be fired over it, she did not deem it fair for her license to be taken away. She concluded Meredith was too good of a surgeon and had worked too hard to get to where she was. Her second testimony and Alex's bringing together a whole group of patients whom Meredith had operated on convinced the panel to let her keep her license. Bailey then told Meredith she could have her job back, which Meredith accepted. They hugged it out.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nThe Monday after, a few hours before getting an ultrasound to find out the sex of the baby, Bailey found out [[Pruitt Herrera]] had been admitted to the hospital with symptoms suggesting his cancer was back. She ran some tests to confirm. Meanwhile, she convinced Amelia to get an ultrasound, something Amelia had been putting off because she was afraid of what it might reveal given [[Christopher Shepherd|her history]]. Pruitt's tests came back, revealing a highly aggressive testicular lymphoma. While she was talking about his poor survival odds, he told her she was bleeding. Carina was called and she did an ultrasound while Ben was making his way to the hospital. As he arrived, Pruitt and Carina expressed their condolences and gave the couple some privacy. Together, they cried over their loss. After the initial grief had worn off a bit, Bailey decided she needed to work and told Ben to go drink with buddies. On her way to her office, she ran into Amelia, who asked about the ultrasound. Hiding the truth, Bailey told her the baby was a girl like she had expected and headed to her office, where she broke down crying after all.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Bailey finds out Ben is trapped inside the bar.]]\nShe cried over the ultrasound pictures before heading home. While she was trying to get a hold of Ben, she came across Joe's bar, where the Station  crew was working to extract a car that had crashed into Joe's bar, trapping everyone inside. [[Dean Miller]] informed her that Ben was among the people inside though not hurt. She deduced some of her staff were trapped, too, and pressured Dean to get them out. He told her she was wasting his time by barking orders at him while she was not his Chief. He made her step back behind the tape. The crew got everyone out. Ben was unharmed and hugged his wife. He admitted he was blaming himself for the miscarriage as he figured it happened due to the stress that his job was causing her. She told him it was not his fault, pointing out that it happened when he wasn't on duty. She then decided to go back to work and had him update her on her injured residents.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTogether, they arrived in the ambulance bay as the trauma doctors took in the residents. Bailey granted Ben privileges to help out. Inside, she retreated in a supply closet to gather herself. She found Levi crying in there. She pulled him up and told him their friends needed them. They headed out to work. Owen and Richard came to help out, too. Ben checked if Bailey was okay but she just stated she had operated on her residents before. Richard told her Ben had called him, implying he knew about the miscarriage, but she only told him to help out wherever he could. Together, they operated on [[Taryn Helm]], who had an internal bleed. She froze as she had to open up Taryn's chest to get better visualization so Richard swiftly took over from her. They saved her together and lingered in the OR afterward. He informed her all the residents had made it through their surgeries. She was relieved and finally let the grief over her miscarriage sink in. She told Richard she had handled losing her best surgeons and friends but couldn't handle this loss of her daughter. She had a hard time accepting that, unlike she and her colleagues had done for injured residents, there was nothing she or anyone else could try to save her. As she said she could only stand there and let the loss happen, she broke down in Richard's arm. Later, Richard and Meredith came by her office with tissues and doughnuts to comfort her. Meredith said she felt lonely when she had her miscarriage so she knew Bailey needed some company.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nBailey took some personal time to grieve the loss.\nOn her first day back, Andrew updated her on all the injured resident. As he took her to [[Suzanne Britland]], they ran into Tom, who commented on her taking time off while the majority of the residents were out. Bailey told him she had other services cover their absence and joined Andrew in Suzanne's room. Suzanne had developed a mysterious condition after an appendectomy. Suzanne crashed in the CT machine due a cardiac tamponade but they managed to bring her back. She and Andrew assured Suzanne later that they would find out what was going on. Bailey had Andrew create the war room and reach out to other doctors to get their opinion. Later, she ran into Tom, who again commented on her taking a vacation. She then told him she was grieving her miscarriage. He sympathized with her, having been through two miscarriages with his ex-wife. He said it is not as easy to get over as people make it seem, which is why he had developed a habit of lighting a candle on what would have been the kids' birthdays. Bailey took his advice and lit a candle in the chapel.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, Bailey had to go tell [[Joey Phillips]], whom Ben had rescued the day before, that he would have to be separated from his siblings, who had been placed in the foster system. She overheard that Tom was doing interview with Pac-North staff to determine who would be hired at Grey Sloan. Bailey wanted to make recommendations but he turned her down, knowing she would recommend the people she had impulsively fired. Afterward, she checked in on the residents in the war room on Suzanne's case and told them to go shower. Finally, she went to see Joey and delivered the bad news. She tried to ease the pain by promising to call social services and find out as much as she could about his siblings' situations. She was told that they try to keep siblings together, though Joey wasn't reassured by that as his siblings weren't his actual siblings but rather kids who had run away from their foster home together. As she and Jo operated on Joey's arm to restore blood flow, Bailey brought up his history of bouncing around the foster system after his parents died in a car accident. Despite being a straight-A student who had taken care of his siblings on his own for months, Jo doubted that he would ever be adopted as  year olds are generally viewed as adults who can fend for themselves. After surgery, the two of them watched Joey sleep. Jo hated how he had nowhere to go, though she was hopeful that he would turn out okay like she and Alex had. Later, Bailey sat down with Meredith and they talked about her breaking up with Andrew and having grown up. Jackson came to inform them that Richard had refused to return to Grey Sloan under Koracick's terms. They gathered the top attendings, who all agreed to quit unless Tom agreed to their terms. Tom conceded.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nOn Richard's first day back, Bailey told him to train the new set of residents from Pac-North. She admitted that was her way of comforting him with his marriage ending soon. She also invited him to dinner but he just walked off. Later, Meredith came into Bailey's office as she was having hot flashes. She voiced her concerns over Andrew's behavior regarding Suzanne's case. Bailey called him into her office and told him Meredith would be taking over the case from him so he could finally sleep. Meredith's first decision was putting Suzanne back on her medication, which Andrew and [[Lauren Riley|Dr. Riley]] had stopped as they believed it was masking her symptoms. Andrew aggressively objected to the decision, but Bailey told him to walk away before saying something he would come to regret. Eventually, Andrew found the right diagnosis and Meredith set up the treatment. Later, [[Cormac Hayes]] informed Bailey that Joey was refusing to do his PT. Bailey arranged a visit from his siblings, who assured him their foster homes weren't bad. She ordered pizza for the kids. As she left the room, she was told by a resident that Richard had let them go home, despite it being not even  o'clock. She sat down with Richard, who told her that those residents weren't Grey Sloan caliber. Having them there felt like Catherine had won. She understood and wanted to help him. He told her he was bone tired, which she said sounded like depression. He said he would be okay and left.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAs a snowstorm hit Seattle, Bailey continued to spend time with Joey in his hospital room to help him study for his GED. She was mad upon finding out Andrew had taken off on foot to retrieve a donor liver at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital|Seattle Pres]] and got upset with Link for discharging Joey in the middle of a blizzard. She knew Joey had declined to talk to a social worker about his options. She dropped by Joey's room and he told her that, having turned eighteen, he had decided he didn't want to risk ending up with crappy foster parents again. She pointed out he could also end up with a great family that could help him get his high school diploma and find a career that he loved. He didn't think that was in store for him. To prove him wrong, she took him on a tour of the hospital to point all different kinds of jobs. In the ER, they came across Owen and Teddy rushing to save a pregnant woman. Bailey and Joey comforted the woman's wife. Joey followed Bailey as she went to get an update and witnessed how the doctors had managed to save both the woman and her baby. As they watched one mother with her baby in the NICU, Joey admitted he was impressed. Bailey then blurted out that Joey should come home with her, having an extra room and extra love to give. She told him about her son and her husband. He agreed to her offer and they hugged. That night, Ben came home with dinner and was surprised to see Joey in his living room wearing his clothes. Bailey told him they should talk.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nHer unilateral decision angered Ben, who went to sleep on the couch. The next morning, Bailey found a letter from Alex in her mail. He wrote that he wouldn't be returning to Grey Sloan. He thanked her for being a great teacher who also let him grow up. As Alex brought up his difficult past and his turning into the guy that Bailey had trusted to run her hospital and keep her secrets. He also wrote that he had decided to stay in Baldwin City to complete the family Izzie had started by using their embryos to have twins. He asked Bailey if she would be willing to write a recommendation so he could apply for a job of Chief of Peds at Shawnee Memorial. He ended his letter by thanking her again, which he knew was small and lame compared to what she had done for him. Ben came home and found Bailey with the letter in her hand. She informed him that Alex had left everyone behind to be a father. She then said it was a matter of luck that Alex became the person that he is today. He survived his home and foster homes and turned into a father and fine surgeon, all by chance. She didn't want Joey's future to be a matter of chance. Ben then agreed to keep Joey, saying that he had just wanted for them to talk it over. Bailey apologized and they agreed neither of them would make big decisions again without consulting the other.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Bailey found Richard objecting to having his furniture from Pac-North moved into his office. He left to go teach a skills lab, leaving Bailey to handle the dispute with the movers. She arranged for his old furniture to be moved into his office instead but he got mad at her for assuming what he wanted. He told her he would handle it and started throwing stuff on the ground as she left. In the ER, Andrew asked Bailey if he could treat patients now that he had agreed to start seeing a counselor. She denied his request, which surprised him, as he thought she would need the help with Richard handing off his entire service. That was news to Bailey, though she stuck with her decision regarding Andrew. She went to see Richard in his empty office. He apologized and said the slightest things set him off lately. He then formally told her he was stepping back from surgery. He wanted to start something new and said having his old furniture reminded him of his old self and cluttered his mind. Bailey argued that the hospital needed him but he simply said he wanted to step away while at the top of his game. She sat down with Meredith in the attendings' lounge, where Meredith was missing Alex cheering her up after a hard day. Bailey related to the feeling. She recalled Richard's speech to the interns and how she dreamed of being the last one standing. However, now that she was the last one standing, the feelings of victory had worn off and she just felt lonely sometimes. She then informed Meredith that Richard was stepping back from surgery.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew convinced Bailey that he was ready to return to work and she allowed him to treat patients again starting with shifts in the clinic. On Meredith's busy pro bono surgery day, Bailey was paged to the clinic by Andrew, who suspected his patient was a human trafficking victim. He made his case stating that Cindy's supposed aunt was answering his questions for her. While Bailey thought he sounded crazy, she went to assess the situation herself. She deemed Cindy and Opal were actually family and told Andrew he was off the case. She also sent him home and told him to meet her in her office the next morning. However, Andrew was persistent and took Cindy to surgery to keep her away from Opal, who ended up finding Cindy anyway. Andrew then went off the rails and physically blocked Opal from getting to Cindy. He drew a crowd as he yelled at Opal to get away. A [[Hospital Codes|code violet]] was called. As his colleagues, including Bailey, arrived, he asked them to form a human chain around Cindy to protect her. Instead, his colleagues formed a human chain around him, indicating they thought of him as the danger, while he yelled at them in an attempt to make them see things his way. Security took him to Bailey's office, where Andrew quit his job rather than accept a suspension. After a talk with Meredith, he agreed to take the suspension if Bailey agreed to call the human trafficking hotline. Bailey agreed and made the call. She was told not to scare the suspects away but found that Opal and Cindy had disappeared, making her fear that Andrew had been right.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nBailey gathered with some other staff in a conference room at Grey Sloan to watch a livestream of Richard's presentation on his PATH pen at the Surgical Innovation Conference in Los Angeles. They all witnessed as he gave an unfocused talk about a cure for cancer with a messy presentation with simple hand-drawn pictures. Maggie and Cormac escorted him off the stage and called .<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nBailey, Meredith, and Amelia assembled a war room to find out what was going on with Richard. Bailey ordered several tests before gathering other doctors. Bailey presented a list with diagnoses that needed ruling out or had been ruled already. During a talk with Richard, they found out he thought Catherine had been at the Conference with him. They added hallucinations to his symptoms. Later in the day, Bailey found Andrew in Richard's room. She reminded him of his suspension but he claimed it was a social visit. She also had him forward her the list that Lauren had sent him. Catherine pushed the doctors to work her. Maggie and Meredith did some cognitive tests on him, which went horribly bad. Maggie was convinced he had some type of rapidly-progressive dementia, though they had yet to find a cause. They returned to Richard's room and found him gone. They spread out to find him. Meredith found him in the OR about to cut himself open. She guided him back to his room. He thought he was at Seattle Grace and wanted to start rounds with the interns. He mentioned Adele, which greatly worried his doctors.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors switched off keeping him company. While playing cards, Richard blanked and stopped playing. As he further declined, the doctors kept looking for the reason behind the decline. After a week, Catherine decided it had been enough and she wanted to take Richard home. However, as they were discharging him, Richard mentioned his feet and hands were numb, convincing the doctors to perform an EMG, which revealed that his whole body was breaking down, thus ruling out dementia. The search for a diagnosis continued. Meredith and Bailey went to do a nerve biopsy but Andrew came barging in, knocking over the instrument tray to force them to stop and listen to him. He suspected Richard was suffering from cobalt poisoning caused by his hip replacement. Meredith drew some blood, which confirmed Andrew's suspicion. Andrew asked to scrub in on the hip replacement. Bailey initially denied his request but Meredith pointed out he had made an incredible save, convincing Bailey to let Andrew scrub in to just watch. Bailey went to fetch Link, who was with Amelia giving birth, and convinced him to go perform the surgery. Amelia then asked Bailey to stay with her. Honoring their Pregnancy Club, Bailey stayed with her and helped her through the delivery, much like George had done for her. Later, Link arrived in the room and Bailey showed him his son. She left the new parents and went to check up on Richard in the ICU. He was stable but still unconscious. He later woke up with normal cognitive function.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nMiranda Bailey has two completely different sides, sometimes she is extremely loving and kind, others she is tough and keeps true to her nickname ''the Nazi''. She usually gives advice to others, being very direct.\n\nAlthough known for her strict personality, Bailey has an excellent bedside manner.\n\nAs a resident, Bailey was well-known amongst the attendings for being no-nonsense and unafraid to call them out for what she perceives to be ineptitude. She took time to warm up to new attendings and famously disliked [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Erica Hahn]], [[Mark Sloan]], and [[Arizona Robbins]] for various reasons after working with them for the first time.<ref>[[Wish You Were Here]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n[[Tucker Jones]]\nShe married Tucker Jones c.. They had been married for ten years and trying to conceive for seven when Miranda announced her pregnancy with their first child. Her son, [[William George Bailey Jones]], was born during a [[It's the End of the World|bomb scare]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]] while [[Tucker Jones|her husband]] was in surgery with [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]], having crashed his car on the way to the hospital. [[George O'Malley]] helped her through labor, and she thanked him by naming her son William George Bailey Jones (although he is nicknamed \"Tuck\" after his father).\n\nDue to her working as a surgeon, Bailey rarely spent time at home, putting a strain on their marriage and following an incident where Tuck was hurt at home, their relationship was strained even more and although they stayed married, Tucker went on dates.\n\nOn discovering Miranda had applied for a pediatric surgery fellowship, Tucker gave her an ultimatum: the fellowship or their marriage. Miranda decided to leave her husband, believing a marriage should never come to an ultimatum, but also declined the fellowship.\n\n[[Sam Bennett]]\nWhile she was still married, he flirted with her.<ref>[[Before and After]], x</ref> When she came to L.A., he almost kissed her. She stopped him and returned home before anything could happen between them.<ref>[[Right Here, Right Now]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n[[Ben Warren]]\nAfter her divorce from Tucker was finalized, Bailey started seeing Ben, an anesthesiologist.<ref>[[Valentine's Day Massacre]], x</ref>\n\nBut after the shooting at Seattle Grace, she broke off her relationship with him, saying she had to put herself back together.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\nWhen drunk, she confessed that she still missed Ben.<ref>[[Slow Night, So Long]], x</ref>\n\nDuring their time apart, Bailey dated another man, but after Ben found out, he decided to fight for her and things ended between Bailey and Eli.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\nAfter things ended with Eli, she got back together with Ben.\n\nBen tried to propose to her through a crossword puzzle which didn't work out like he planned, and in the end Miranda herself asked him to marry her twice.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day they were supposed to get married, Bailey got caught up with [[Adele Webber]] when she and Richard found out that Adele was coughing up blood and had been rushed to the hospital. They turned the limo that was taking them to the wedding around and went to the hospital instead.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nBailey and Meredith operated on Adele, before returning to her wedding and tying the knot with Ben.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nAfter their marriage, Ben had gotten a surgical internship at UCLA and had to leave. Their marriage was strained while he was at UCLA, but Ben came to Seattle to vist Miranda every once in a while. Later, Ben quit his job because he felt he didn't see Miranda or Tuck, his stepson. Miranda was not very happy at first, but he did not want to give up surgery and got a job at Grey Sloan Memorial. \n\nBen operated on a man in the psych ward with a clipboard and operated on a pregnant women without proper consent in a hall and she died. He was put on probation for  months by Miranda. Instead of not doing any work, he acted as an attending anesthesiologist which angered Miranda because she felt that he wasn't taking his probation seriously, but she couldn't do anything about it, as she wasn't in control over the anesthesiologist department. \n\nHe later became a firefighter, which scared Miranda as he was the one running into the fire, not running away. Because of the stress of his job, one day when he was going to work, she told him to drop her off at Seattle Presbyterian hospital. She told him that it was a meeting and blew him off, so he just dropped her off and drove to his job. \n\nWhen he was told that she was having a heart attack, Ben dropped his hot dogs and ran to the hospital, freaking out. He was with her when she woke up, as was Maggie Pierce and Richard Webber. Ben told her that he would quit for her but Miranda told him not to, as his job did stress him out, but she knew that this was what he wanted to do. \n\n[[Eli Lloyd]]\nEli, a nurse, asked her out, and the two dated for a while, even to the extent of sleeping together in the on-call room, something which Miranda never actually thought she would do, given her stellar reputation.\n\nAfter Ben returned, she dumped Eli. Even before Ben returned, Miranda admitted she wasn't looking for a long-term relationship with Eli.\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMiranda had a strained relationship with Meredith in the beginning because of Meredith's relationship with Derek, but they soon became friendly. They also worked on a medical trial to try to cure diabetes together, although Bailey refused to allow her to help at first because of what happened with Derek's Alzheimer's trial. Eventually, Bailey became close with Meredith, even demanding that Meredith be a bridesmaid in her wedding to [[Ben Warren|Ben]]. After the wedding, they remained close.\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nBailey said that Cristina was the one intern she didn't have to worry about.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nIzzie was not her favorite in the beginning. Then when Izzie cut Denny's L-VAD wire, Bailey really had a disliking for her. When Izzie got cancer, Bailey softened up. Bailey once accused her of being too \"attached\" to her patients. \n\nWhen Izzie went under for brain surgery for her cancer, she had been knitting a scarf earlier. Before Izzie went down, she told Bailey that the scarf was for her. \n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nBailey said [[Heart-Shaped Box|George was her favorite]] of her interns. She also named [[William George Bailey Jones|her son]] after him. He coached her through her labor and delivery, allowing her to work through the stress of her husband's car accident.\n\nWhen George told her he was joining the army, Bailey freaked out, and with the help of other doctors, they staged an \"intervention\" to stop him from going. Owen told them that it was his choice, but they started blaming Owen for him joining the army because he encouraged George a lot with trauma surgery and talked about his experiences in the army. \n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShe thinks Alex was made to be a peds surgeon. After learning of Alex's past from his younger brother, Bailey says she is impressed Alex became a doctor, due to his troubled upbringing. She also remarks on how impressing her is not an easy feat.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nWebber has been her mentor since she was a resident, and has encouraged her to become the person she is today. Bailey looks up to Webber. \n\nOthers\nThrough the rest of that residency year, Bailey had to adjust to becoming a parent and reconciling this with her desire to continue her career as a surgeon. Her professional confidence was shaken when [[Izzie Stevens]] cut Denny Duquette's [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire and Denny subsequently died after his heart transplant; Bailey felt that she wasn't in control of her interns and that the incident was ultimately her fault. She was criticized for the events at a Morbidity and Mortality conference, with one colleague questioning outright her competence at juggling career and motherhood. While her confidence has been somewhat restored since then, she still feels bad about not spending enough time with her son, once making a late-night call to sing \"God Bless the Child\" to him. During her pregnancy, she was upset that her interns had driven away two residents and no one wanted them. When she returned to work, she was making sure that her colleagues knew that she hadn't gone soft because she had become a mother.\n\nFollowing severe injuries to her son and several arguments over the state of their marriage, Bailey and her husband separated because her husband believed that she placed her job at the hospital before her family and that it led to Tuck's injuries. Bailey's relationship with [[Erica Hahn]] is quite strained. Although Erica saved her son's life, she temporarily stopped the surgery until Bailey left and when Bailey asked Erica for help on a surgery, the whole day Erica was quite negative and kept putting Bailey down.\n\n\nMiranda Bailey, a graduate of [[Wellesley College]], is an [[attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]]. She says she was the only female intern in her year, but she was the best and she won the first solo surgery. She was also previously in charge of the five interns Meredith, Cristina, Izzie, Alex, and George (although Alex was not originally hers). Her colleagues used to refer to her as \"The Nazi\" because of her tough personality and blunt attitude although she behaves almost in the exact opposite way with patients and has a great bedside manner.\n\nAlthough she was often harsh with her interns, she has been shown to provide both support and advice when they need it; practicing \"tough love.\" For instance, Bailey stayed by Cristina during her pregnancy scare and her initial recovery; she also held Izzie's hand when Izzie was giving bone marrow for her daughter. She cares about her patients and is a committed surgeon. When she first learned about Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd she became brisk with her but it was to prove Meredith had no favor. She protected her while she was looked at by all the Seattle Grace when Derek choose Addison over her, she admitted he had put himself between two remarkable women.\n\nDisillusioned by how little she can help patients as a surgeon, Bailey decided to open a free clinic at Seattle Grace. She faced initial difficulties getting support from the attendings, but after talking with the Chief, managed to get their agreement to work there. The Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic has since opened, paid for using part of the $. million bequeathed to Izzie by [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]], and Bailey is satisfied that the clinic will change people's lives for the better. She competed for the post of Chief Resident, but she found out she lost to [[Callie Torres]]. [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] has indicated that she could eventually become Chief of Surgery.\n\nMiranda became a th-year resident and decided to be Callie's \"number two,\" as Torres was lacking in performance as Chief Resident. The Chief saw Bailey pick up the slack, and delegate exceptionally well, and eventually realized that Miranda was covering for Callie. He fired Torres from the position and told Bailey that he made a mistake in not giving her the job in the first place. He also apologized for taking Dr. Bailey for granted. At this Miranda broke down in tears hugged the Chief. This is an example of the emotional baggage the \"Nazi\" carries and shows one of her very rare emotional moments. Miranda helped save the life of a white supremacist paramedic despite his racist treatment of her. When closing his stomach after the surgery, she comments to George that the incision will need to be aligned better, thus ruining the paramedic's large swastika tattoo on his stomach. During the surgery, she declared that she didn't want to be called the Nazi anymore.\n\n[[Image:x-.JPG|thumb|left|px|Bailey pregnant.]]\n\nDr. Bailey was nearing the end of her surgical residency in [[General Surgery]], and Richard Webber had planned for her to become a general surgery attending. Although for a while she claimed she was growing tired of appys and gall bladders and nothing excited her but while treating a child that almost died, she wanted to stick with general surgery. Unfortunately, she had been assigned to another child. While treating the child, both Dixon and Robbins said she was a true pediatric surgeon because of her disregard of rules, her personal interest in patients and taking the time to explain surgeries to the patients and the children. Privately, she told Arizona how she felt when her son Tuck was admitted and said, because of how she felt, it would make her bad for pediatric surgery. But in contrast, Arizona told her that in her opinion it made her uniquely qualified. Eventually, she decided to pursue a pediatric surgery fellowship, despite the Chief's disagreement. Armed with letters of recommendation from [[Derek Shepherd|Shepherd]], [[Mark Sloan|Sloan]], [[George O'Malley|O'Malley]], and a disappointing letter from [[Richard Webber|the chief]], she is very excited about [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison's]] letter of recommendation, labeling her the \"the most promising peds surgeon I've ever had the pleasure of working with\". Even though Arizona claims the Chief is the major factor in the decision, the implication of Addison's referral should make a much larger difference than any other doctor she could have, as Addison is a world-class neonatal surgeon, hopefully outranking most other letters of recommendation Bailey has.\n\nBailey eventually gains the pediatric surgery fellowship, and even the Chief signs on and agrees with it, but Bailey is unable to take the position and asks for a job as a General Surgery attending, after making the decision to leave her husband, as a fellowship for  years of long hours is not healthy for a single mother.\n\nAs a general surgery attending, Bailey spearheads an initiative to reduce post-operative fistula formations. After introducing a new protocol that involves the removal of a drain on day  versus day , the formation is reduced by %.\n\nWith Richard stepping down as Chief of Surgery, Miranda appeared livid, when Owen Hunt was ushered into the position, however, she eventually supports this decision. Bailey later admitted that she thought she would have eventually become Chief of Surgery after him.<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\nAlong with stepping down from his position, Dr. Webber passed on his clinical trial on diabetes to her. Along the way, Richard kept insisting that Bailey have [[Meredith Grey]] help her, which she refused because she partly blamed Meredith for Richard's downfall. Eventually, Bailey hit a rough patch in her own research and begun shutting out Webber from their lab of mice. Though she employed [[April Kepner]] to assist her, it was not until Meredith began working on the case that the problem was finally discovered. Meredith discovered that parts of her mother's research were wrong and that the first few devices installed in their first patients would eventually become ineffective. After [[Teddy Altman|Teddy's]] husband [[Henry Burton]] dies, the trial was not mentioned again.\n\nBailey later pursued\uaa new project of genome mapping that will arm doctors the necessary information to treat diseases at the source rather than treating the symptoms as they arise. A while after, because of defective gloves, she unintentionally infected three of her patients with a staph infection and was investigated by the CDC. While her name was eventually cleared and her infection was eradicated and all three patients died, she overheard Richard telling a patient that the one doctor who caused the infection had been isolated. This affected Bailey greatly, causing her to lock herself in her genome lab, shutting out the other doctors, particularly the board and Richard, for a day while she obsessively mapped her own genome over and over again. She was drawn out only by her husband, Ben, but she still refused to perform surgeries, until she had to operate on Meredith.\n\nAfter Owen decided to step down as Chief of Surgery, Richard suggested Bailey as his successor to the board, but Catherine didn't want him to just give her the position. They agreed on her bringing in one outside candidate,\ua[[Tracy McConnell|Dr. Tracy McConnell]], but Bailey convinced the board to choose her by talking about how passionate she was about the hospital. As of now, Bailey is one of the few female Chiefs of Surgery.\n\n\n*Bailey was the only female intern in her year. She also won the first solo surgery.\n*Bailey states in [[Deny, Deny, Deny]] that her cystic fibrosis patient [[Jeremiah Tate]] has been her patient for at least five years. However, she was later established as being a th-year resident at the time.\n**At the time of the episode airing, Bailey's year of residency had not been established, though it had been originally implied she was a th-year, as she discussed fellowship decisions during her pregnancy in the same season and was in charge of the OR in the [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|first season]]. Late in the [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|third season]], Bailey was established to be a th-year surgical resident, and the first three seasons take place in one year, following the [[Timeline|timeline being retconned]]. \n***However, Bailey states in [[The Time Warp]] (which takes place early  when [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] is a third-year resident and Bailey an attending after finishing residency in ) that she began her internship in . This would have made her a resident for five years during Meredith's intern year, somewhat corroborating the original comment in [[Deny, Deny, Deny]], but it would also mean she did residency for six years.\n*Bailey states to Derek she has been married for ten years in the Season  episode [[Bring the Pain]]. She and Richard both later recall in Season 's [[I Was Made for Lovin' You]] that Richard and his wife [[Adele Webber|Adele]] attended her first wedding. If not a timeline mistake, this means Webber had not met Bailey on her first day of internship but rather has known Bailey for at least  years at that point (likely when she was a college student). It is possibly an unexplained storyline, as Richard also recalls later in Season 's [[Run, Baby, Run]] that Bailey was a \"child\" when she married Tucker, but is now an \"adult\" marrying Ben. \n*Bailey's father [[William Bailey|William]] in [[Holidaze]] says her \"cousin said something to her husband in front of your niece, who said something to your younger niece, who said something to your mother\". It is later revealed Bailey's only sibling died as an infant, so she would not have any biological nieces. Bailey's father was likely referring to her then-brother or sister-in-law (Tuck's sibling)'s two daughters, as he is upset about their impending divorce.   \n*Bailey believed in Santa until the age of eleven.\n*She knows a lot about Sci-Fi, notably [[Star Wars]], and is a collector of Judy dolls, seeing as how she could identify each doll and their accompanying accessories.\n*She hates bad liars.<ref>[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]], x</ref>\n*Bailey was always nicknamed ''The Nazi'', but the nickname stopped when a [[Shane|racist patient]] with a tattoo of a swastika who came in for a surgery refused to let her operate on him alone.\n*Bailey often says ''Va-jay-jay'' instead of saying ''vagina''.\n*Bailey has changed her hairstyle more than any other character.\n*The reputation of Nazi precedes Bailey, and the \"Nazi\" is said to have \"''balls the size of Texas''\".\n*[[Sandra Oh]] originally auditioned for the part of Bailey, not Cristina.\n*Her original character description was \"Tiny, blonde, with curls.\"- in reference to the Nazi's preference of Aryans, who had blonde hair and blue eyes.\n*She has arachnophobia, the fear of arachnids such as spiders and scorpions.\n*Her new nickname is \"BCB\", which means Booty-call Bailey because of her frequent \"contacts\" with [[Ben Warren]] whenever he came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] from LA.\n*Bailey officiated [[Callie Torres]] and [[Arizona Robbins]]' marriage.<ref>[[White Wedding]], x</ref>\n*She refers to the hospital shooting as the worst day of her life.\n*[[Derek Shepherd]] and [[Meredith Grey]] named their son [[Derek Bailey Shepherd]] in her honor.\n*Bailey played the oboe while in high school and also took dance classes.\n*She likes extra crumb topping on her macaroni.\n*She enjoys extra thick strawberry milkshakes.\n*She likes waffles.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n*She's afraid of snakes, large spiders, and sharks.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n*She is the first female [[Chief of Surgery]] at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital or any of its predecessors.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n*Although not stated directly in dialogue, Bailey is [[Board Certification|board certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|general surgery]], as [[George O'Malley|George]], during his second-time as an [[Internship|intern]], was calculating Bailey's required OR time to sit for boards during her fifth and final year of [[Resident|residency]].\n*During her fourth year of [[Resident|residency]], Bailey applied for five [[Fellow|fellowship]] programs, including Seattle Grace's; however, this has not been brought up since as Bailey considered a [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]] fellowship the following year, which she subsequently turned down, in favor of being a general surgery [[Attending|attending]] when she completed her residency.\n*Bailey is the only character to have said Preston Burke's middle name (Xavier) on-screen.\n*She refers to her interns as her \"babies.\"\n*Bailey lost her virginity to her ex-husband, [[Tucker Jones]].\n*Bailey would like to have her way with Idris Elba.\n*When Bailey appointed [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[General Surgery]], it was implied that Bailey was the unofficial department head of general surgery when she was an attending under [[Richard Webber]] and [[Owen Hunt]].<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n*She's '\".<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref> Hence, she has been known to stand on a stool when performing surgery.\n*Her favorite places to have sex in the hospital are the OR galleries after-hours, a spare patient room on the fourth floor, and the library.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n*She drinks her coffee black.\n*Bailey was the first character to appear in every Grey's Anatomy Universe show.

Richard told him to go to do it anyway and he did.\n\nLater, when Catherine came to the hospital looking for Richard, Zander asked her to wait so he could page Richard because Richard had been having coffee with his wife, meaning Gemma. Catherine informed him that she is Richard's wife. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nWhen Pac-North was purchased and closed, Zander was hired to continue his residency at Grey Sloan. Bailey sent him and the other residents to do a skills lab with Richard Webber. However, Richard became discouraged during the lab and sent all the residents home early. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\n\nDuring COVID-, Zander took shifts outside the hospital, taking patients' temperatures and directing them where to go. When one patient came in with a rash, Zander took his temperature and directed him into the ER. When he said he didn't want a Chinese doctor, Zander told him he could go back to the parking lot and hope he didn't die of anaphylactic shock. The patient decided to enter the hospital instead. ''(\uc[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\ud)''\n\nZander came to tell Bailey that Catherine was ready for their meeting. When he saw that Bailey was injured, he asked if he should tell her to wait and if so, could someone else tell her because he's not Catherine's favorite person. Bailey said she'd be there soon. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nWhen a patient, [[Byron Gibbis]], ran through the hospital nude because he was scared to have surgery, Zander saw him and pointed the doctors in his direction when they came looking for him. Later, he reminded everyone at Andrew's memorial that even though they were outside, they still needed to maintain their social distance. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Vic and Travis brought [[Charlie (Station )|Charlie]] to the hospital after his second overdose in three days, Zander informed them that it was his third visit in a month. When they brought in [[Libby]] next, he wasn't surprised to learn that she was Charlie's friend. ''(\"[[No One is Alone]]\")''\n\n\nWhen it started to look like Meredith would get discharged, Richard asked Zander to prepare a clap-out, but keep it quiet as he wanted it to be a surprise. He did so, but when Meredith got discharged, she disappeared and Zander had to tell everyone she wasn't in her room. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, Zander was excited to learn from her. Inspired by Meredith, he asked to listen to [[Gerlie Bernardo|Gerlie's]] lungs before she was discharged, as he hadn't gotten the chance to listen to lungs that had recovered from COVID. Starting in October , Meredith cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, Zander was able to get his first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs while Zander attended Maggie and Winston's wedding. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them  seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total, thirteen patients were treated using this method. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nThe residents enjoyed this new teaching method and eagerly awaited each day. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nZander was assigned to do an appendecomy one day. As he went to close, he asked the nurse which suture would be better to use. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhen The Webber Method led to the death of [[Devon Gomez]], Zander attended the M&M conference designed to determine how his death could have been prevented. At the conference, when questioning targeted The Webber Method and its role in his death, Zander said that Richard was just thinking of their education.\n\nThat same day, Zander treated [[Lila Hanley]] in the ER. Lila had severe pain below her knee, which had previously been treated with cortisone shots. After a thorough exam, Zander tried to tell Link that Lila needed an MRI, but Link ignored him and told Lila that if she wanted a more permanent solution, she should try losing weight. This offended Lila, who got up and went to leave, which is when Link noticed she had foot drop, something Zander had already noticed. Lila got an MRI, which showed a herniated disk, which was causing her pain. Zander called Link out on this, saying Link should have taken the time to see beyond her BMI. Bailey backed him up, telling him to stop looking at patients' BMI, which was not a good measure of anyone's health. In Lila's surgery, Link let Zander do the discectomy. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Levi quit, the other residents were only getting assigned simple procedures, which they considered a form of punishment. When Richard didn't show up for work, they questioned what they were supposed to do. Meredith, who was operating on [[David Hamilton]] that day, went to Hamilton and asked if she could use his surgery as a teaching opportunity and allow all hospital staff to observe. The residents were eager to be part of this. Before the surgery started, Meredith explained what they were doing and gave them time to ask questions. The surgery then proceeded and went well. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] stepped in to act as chief for the day so Bailey could operate and cover the shortage of surgeons, Zander scrubbed in with her on multiple surgeries, sharing in her joy of operating. Then he went to the gallery to watch Maggie operate on [[Fernanda Lima]], who have traveled to Seattle from Boston with her family to have heart surgery. However, had to leave with Owen came in and told the residents they needed to leave to help cover the physician shortage. Specifically, he said that Zander was assigned to general so he should be assisting another surgeon in another OR. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nZander and the other residents were called to do grand rounds with [[Nick Marsh]] and [[Meredith Grey]]. They arrived to find Nick with the patient, Mason Taylor, who was brain dead after being struck by a drunk driver. His wife wanted to donate his organs, but UNOS rejected them, so she donated his body for research. Nick explained that they would be transplanting a genetically modified pig kidney into Mason's body in the hopes that they could perfect the technology, which would eliminate the wait for donor organs. He transplanted the kidney near the groin so they had better blood supply and could see the kidney as they waited to see if it would work. After the surgery, they celebrated that the kidney was producing urine. When the kidney later stopped working, Nick had them do a biopsy and sent the residents away to avoid screaming at them. Then he did everything he could to save the kidney, but started to lose faith. Meredith suggested using epinephrine, which worked and Jordan reported that the kidney was working again. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nZander helped Winston and Maggie when they were testing a medical device [[Wendell Ndugu]] was attempting to sell. When the patch showed that the patient had no heartbeat, Winston tested it on himself and concluded that it didn't work when it gave the same readout. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\n\nZander was working the day that [[Jamarah Blake]] returned to the hospital to evaluate the program to see if it could remain open. He helped out with a blood drive they held that day in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the nationwide blood shortage. He then watched as Meredith and Nick attempted to remove [[Cora|Cora's]] tumor in an ex-vivo surgery. During this surgery, he accidentally informed Jamarah Blake that Meredith was leaving the hospital. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\nLater, he and the other residents spread the word on social media that the hospital needed blood, drawing in several donors. At the end of the day, when the surgical residency program was shut down, he packed up his things. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nHe is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\n*He drinks Kombucha.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[A Diagnosis]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[The Center Won't Hold]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[It's All Too Much]]\nSxZanderPerez.png|[[No One is Alone]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Tradition]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Hotter Than Hell]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Out for Blood]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[You Are the Blood]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Zander Perez Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Zander Perez]]\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Perez, Zander}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She was brought to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] where she bonded with [[Alex Karev|Alex]] but later left when she recovered her memories. She later reappeared and although they loved each other, she slit her wrists and almost died, thus Alex was forced to have her transferred to a psychiatric facility.\n\n\n\nAlex Karev found a semi-conscious pregnant woman crushed under a cement pylon, suffering from several severe injuries, after the ferry accident. He rode to the hospital with her in the ambulance. He had to put her on her side to improve her circulation.\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Ava after the crash.]]\nUpon arrival at Seattle Grace, the Jane Doe was submitted to a battery of tests and surgeries to evaluate her condition and that of her baby, as well as treat her injuries. She was then taken into surgery to start repairing some of the damage. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\nScans showed a cardiac tamponade, which was treated during surgery. During surgery, her baby started having late decels, but Addison was able to control it and Burke finished the surgery. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nShe woke up after her surgery confused. She thought that Alex was her husband and they quickly realized that she had no memory of her life before the accident. She was worried about not knowing anything about her life, so Alex used her labs to tell her what they'd learned about her. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\nBecause of the damage to her face, she was difficult to identify and there was no match on her prints. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\n\nShe had a fracture to her orbital socket, meaning she needed surgery. [[Mark Sloan]] said it needed to happen as soon as possible, but [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] recommended that they wait a day or two to minimize risk to her baby. Rebecca decided to have the surgery immediately. During the surgery, the baby went into distress and Jane Doe had vaginal bleeding. Addison was called in and she had to do a cervical cerclage. After her surgery, her sight was safe. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\n\nEventually, [[Mark Sloan]] presented Jane Doe with options for her facial reconstruction. She had trouble choosing because none of them looked familiar and she didn't want to pick the wrong one. Alex helped her with the decision by assigning each face a name and identity. Jane Doe chose the face Alex called \"Ava\", and adopted the moniker for herself following the surgery. ''(\"[[My Favorite Mistake]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her facial reconstruction was completed and the bandages off, they took some pictures of her to get them out. A couple ([[Joan Waring|Joan]] and [[Frank Waring]]) came to the hospital thinking that Jane Doe was their daughter,\uaShannon Marie.\uaShe matched the basic description of their daughter,\uaso she allowed them to come in and see her. She asked if she could go home with them. Alex said he'd look into it, but it fell through when Joan realized that Jane Doe wasn't actually her daughter. After they left, Alex had to break the news to her. She was upset at still not knowing who she was and caused a fight between Alex and herself. ''(\"[[Time After Time]]\")''\n\n\nAva developed pre-eclampsia and the baby developed edema. She was given an epidural in an attempt to stabilize her, but she had a seizure, so she was rushed to the OR for an emergency c-section even though she was only  weeks pregnant. Ava started to panic after the birth because there was additional bleeding. However, Alex was able to calm her down while Addison finished the surgery. ''(\"[[Desire]]\")''\n\n\nBecause her more emergency health issues were addressed and her memory had still not come back, [[Derek Shepherd]] agreed to look more seriously into possible causes for the memory loss. By this point, Ava was able to get up and walk around. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nDerek found bleeding in her brain, which he said could have been from one of her other surgeries. She needed brain surgery, but he warned her that due to the location of the bleed, she needed to be awake during the surgery. He said there was a chance she could get her memory back from the surgery. Alex had her identify the items on cards while Derek stimulated different parts of her brain. They learned that she speaks German, Spanish, and French. When she woke up after surgery, she was upset that her memory had not come back. She worried about what would happen if she never remembered her life. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nWhile helping Alex study for his intern exam, Ava remembered her dad's face. Alex was excited, but Ava minimized it, saying it was nothing. Alex went to Derek and asked him to run tests. When Alex tried to run the tests, Ava refused to cooperate. He then figured out that her memory had come back and she was lying to him about it. She said she was in an unhappy marriage with a nice guy. She was upset because he hadn't come to look for her while she was missing. She later told Alex that her name was Rebecca Pope. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\n\nRebecca's husband, Jeff, came to the hospital to get her. Rebecca was cleared by all her doctors to go home and her baby was discharged. However, she told Alex to give her a reason to stay. He left after saying she should stay with Jeff. By the time he returned, having changed his mind, she had left with her husband. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nRebecca came back to Seattle to see Alex on Halloween. She said the only thing she'd wanted to be for Halloween was Ava. He kissed her deeply. They went to an on-call room, where Rebecca said that she was upset that Alex hadn't come for her. They still went on to have sex. Afterward, Alex was paged away. When he returned, Rebecca was gone, but had left a piece of her clothing. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\nRebecca came back again and Alex let her sneak into the gallery to watch a surgery, even though it was against the rules. When Lexie came in and sat down next to her, Rebecca told Lexie who she was. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\nMark later saw her there and busted Alex. Alex got suspended for a week over it. He told Rebecca that he believed she was just playing dress-up coming to Seattle. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\nRebecca came back again, saying she was pregnant. Alex asked her if she was keeping it or having an abortion and then left abruptly. She went down to the clinic, where the did a pregnancy test. Alex later came back and placed his hand on her belly, not knowing that the pregnancy test had come back negative. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\nAlex got a second job at [[Emerald City Bar]] in order to help him save up money so he and Rebecca could get a place together.\n\nRebecca came into the hospital wanting to get a consult from Mark Sloan. Izzie found her and informed her that the pregnancy test had been negative, but Rebecca didn't believe her. At the consult with Mark, she said she wanted a new body because it didn't match the face he made her. He said he couldn't operate because she said she was pregnant. Mark told Izzie they might be looking at Acute Stress Disorder as a result of her facial reconstruction. He told Izzie to make it clear to her that she was not pregnant and get her a psych consult. Izzie did an ultrasound and showed Rebecca that there was nothing in her uterus. Rebecca then thought she had lost the baby, despite being told she never was pregnant. Instead of getting the psych consult, Alex brought her home so he could take care of her. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\nAlex continued to take care of Rebecca, feeding her and bathing her while she remained in an almost catatonic state. Later, when he left her unattended with a knife to answer a phone call, she slit her wrists. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nAlex brought her into the ER to stitch up her wrists. He insisted that he could still handle it, but Izzie had technically admitted her, so she called for a psych consult. Alex sent away the consult, but called her husband, who said he'd taken the baby and left her two months ago. He went to Rebecca and said that she had underlying borderline personality disorder that was aggravated by her face being changed. He said she'd spend the night in the hospital and then be transferred to a psychiatric facility. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAfter Alex realized she had regained her memory, he tried to convince her to tell the authorities so that her family could be located; although she initially refused, she eventually confessed that her real name was Rebecca Pope. This finally led her husband, [[Jeff Pope]], to reunite with her, and though Rebecca pleaded with Alex to \"give me a reason to stay\", he refused and told her to stay with the better guy, only to regret his decision later, but it was too late: Rebecca and her daughter had left with Jeff, leaving Alex to stare at an empty room. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\nRebecca reappeared. Rebecca explained to Alex that in her town at Halloween, all the mothers dressed up. She confessed that the only person she wanted to be was Ava. Alex kissed Rebecca and the two proceeded to an [[On-Call Room]]. Alex made a move to have sex, but Rebecca stopped him, telling him he was a 'chicken' and 'didn't come looking for her'. She told him that she 'had to come looking for him'. The two eventually had sex and Rebecca alluded to the fact she no longer loves her husband. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\nA while later, Rebecca returned again to see Alex. She invited him to have coffee, but he turned her down due to a surgery. Rebecca begged him to let her watch it, and she dressed as a resident to have Alex sneak her into the gallery, where Lexie met her and found out about Alex's \"other girlfriend,\" and both Izzie and Mark discovered her. Alex was suspended from the [[Operating Room|O.R.]] for two weeks and later in his bedroom as Rebecca kissed him, he yelled at her, telling her that she was only at Seattle Grace \"to play dress up\" and that she should go back to her life so he could get on with his. However, after this angry speech, he continued to kiss her and they slept together.\n\nAbout six weeks later, Rebecca came back to Seattle Grace once again with news for Alex\ushe was pregnant. Alex was reluctant at first to have anything to do with her or the baby, but eventually he accepted it and excitedly began to build a new life for him, the baby, and Rebecca, who left to tell her husband she was leaving him. However, Izzie discovered that she was not actually pregnant and she had even temporarily forgotten she already had a baby. Alex eventually saw that Rebecca indeed was not pregnant, and became slightly worried when she didn't listen to him and instead insisted that she lost the baby. He took her home and decided to take care of her, disregarding Izzie's observations that Rebecca \"isn't looking very good.\"\n\nRebecca sank into depression after learning that \"she lost the baby\" and Alex was adamant that he could take care of her. However, when he was in another room, she attempted to cut her wrists with a kitchen knife. Alex brought her to the [[Emergency Room|ER]] and got even angrier at Izzie when she tried to get Rebecca a psych consult so she could be admitted. Izzie finally stood her ground and got Rebecca a psych consult. Later, Alex called Jeff Pope and discovered that two months earlier, he took the baby girl and left Rebecca. Rebecca was eventually put into psych. When Alex told her, she accepted it, but told him she was trying to be better for him. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n[[Jeff Pope]]\nShe was married to Jeff Pope. They met in college and got married the year after they graduated. She wanted to move to New York, but he wanted to live on the side of a mountain and take over his father's woodworking shop. She says she was going out of her mind in her marriage, which is why she left. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nHe later left her and took the baby. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nHer daughter has her father's nose. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nWhen she came to Seattle on Halloween, she said her daughter was perfect. She sucked on her fingers and made a cartoon-like suckling sound. She was soothed by being wrapped in a shirt her mother had been wearing.

After the big explosion in the hospital, she was fired by Chief Bailey. While at Grey Sloan, she developed a brief romantic liaison with [[Arizona Robbins]].\n\n\n\nWhen she was two, her father looked for swimming lessons for her. Instead of getting them, her mother threw her into the pool.\n\n\nAfter deciding the residency program needed work, Catherine Avery convinced Miranda Bailey to hire Eliza to come in and shake things up. She first held a meeting with all the residents and asked them about the attendings and what they liked and didn't like about the program. Then she observed several surgeries, giving tips to the attendings on how they could improve their residents' experience and teach them more. At the end of the day, she told Bailey she was fielding a few other offers, but she liked the idea of working there. ''(\"[[Why Try to Change Me Now]]\")''\n\n\nWhile unpacking, she saw on the news that a building had collapsed and rushed to the hospital to help out. ''(\"[[You Haven't Done Nothin']]\")''\n\nOn her official first day, Eliza re-arranged the surgical schedule so she could be involved in as many surgeries as possible. However, the attendings conspired to work against her and shut her out of their surgeries. She in particular butted heads with Richard, who believed she was overstepping and invited her to fight. ''(\"[[Jukebox Hero]]\")''\n\nEliza butted heads with Meredith when Meredith refused to allow Minnick to employ her teaching strategy in one of Meredith's surgeries. As a result, Bailey suspended Meredith. When Eliza heard about this, she went to Bailey and instructed her not to suspend anyone else, as it was contrary to her method of getting people on board with her program. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she decided it was time to implement the second phase of her teaching program, Eliza drew two resident's names (Ben and Stephanie's) out of a hat to do start-to-finish surgeries. She followed Stephanie along on her case. Her first intended patient died before surgery, so she and Eliza went down to the ER to troll for cases. They found [[Matty]], a  year old with gallstones. Arizona found out and insisted on scrubbing in because Matty was a child. During surgery, Matty died. Eliza was stunned and walked away even after Stephanie asked what had happened. Arizona followed her and told her she screwed up by not talking to Stephanie, who had just lost her first child and was vulnerable to quitting the program. However, Eliza revealed that it was the first child she'd ever lost. Arizona coached her on how to get through it and then they went to tell Matty's parents. However, they found Richard already helping Stephanie tell them. Eliza cried in her car after work. When Arizona found her, she hugged her and told her she could have friends at the hospital if she wanted. ''(\"[[It Only Gets Much Worse]]\")''\n\nEliza coordinated the residents working on a kidney transplant from [[Cynthia Daniels]] to [[Christopher Daniels]]. When Cynthia's remaining kidney died, Eliza was part of the discussion about the legality of whose kidney it was. In the end, Cynthia's kidney was put back in her body and Christopher received a kidney from his father. ''(\"[[Back Where You Belong]]\")''\n\n\nEliza sat down with Richard and Bailey and evaluated each of the residents. She had concerns about Ben, noticing that he'd started taking safer cases after the death of [[Gretchen McKay]] and her baby. She also worried about Stephanie, because she hadn't had counseling after the death of [[Kyle Diaz]]. When Stephanie threw a tablet at [[David Fisher|David Fisher's]] head, Eliza recommended suspension. Stephanie had a meeting with the three of them, where she was told her surgical privileges were revoked and she would have to undergo counseling. ''(\"[[Leave It Inside]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Liam Fisher]] came into the ER with a persistent headache, he was diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma. They were going to operate, but they had to find his parents first. When they found them, they declined consent on religious grounds. He went home with his parents, but later returned again. Eliza learned he was having surgery and asked Alex how he got the parents to consent. Alex said he didn't need it because the case had become emergent. Eliza was suspicious, so she questioned Stephanie about the case, but Stephanie stood by the chart. After Stephanie threw a tablet at Liam's father's head, Eliza said Stephanie needed to be suspended until she completed counseling. ''(\"[[Leave It Inside]]\")''\n\nWhen Stephanie returned before completing all the therapy, Eliza was upset to learn that Richard had signed the form to allow her early return. She assigned Stephanie to babysitting duty, having her watch [[Keith]] for signs of internal bleeding. ''(\"[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]]\")''\n\n\nIn the midst of the chaos caused by an explosion and the subsequent hospital fire, Jackson asked Eliza to inform the police that Stephanie was missing. However, since Eliza was preoccupied with the protocol to get the patients out of the building, she completely forgot to do so. Later, in a meeting with Catherine, Richard, and Bailey, she defended herself, stating that if Edwards had listened to her and gone to counseling, she wouldn't have been in any danger. Bailey countered that [[Erin Miller]] wouldn't have made it out alive then, and promptly fired Eliza, explaining that they don't need surgical robots who strictly follow protocols. They need doctors who know when to ditch protocol and save patients, and Richard knows how to train those. Eliza then went to pack up her stuff and told Arizona she had been fired. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\nAfter being fired, she refused to respond to Arizona and moved out of her apartment without so much as a goodbye. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nWhen she first came to Grey Sloan, she flirted with Arizona Robbins, telling her she didn't need to write her name down to remember it. ''(\"[[Why Try to Change Me Now]]\")''\n\nWhen she came to the hospital to help out after a building collapsed, she was surprised that Arizona appeared not to remember their conversation, but Arizona admitted that she did and she was interested, but she didn't like that Eliza talked like she owned the place. They agreed to go get a drink together. ''(\"[[You Haven't Done Nothin']]\")''\n\nThe next day, when Eliza officially started, Arizona had joined the resistance against Eliza's policies. Despite this, Eliza found Arizona at the end of the day and told her that her allowing Leah to take the lead on the Wallace baby was a perfect example of her teaching strategy and thanked her for being on board. ''(\"[[Jukebox Hero]]\")''\n\nAs Arizona was leaving the hospital the next day, Eliza found her and when Arizona claimed she'd be happy if Eliza were fired, Eliza called her on it, saying it would scare her because it would mean the two of them could be something. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\nAfter losing her first child patient, Eliza was distraught and Arizona coached her on how to get through that loss. At the end of the day, when Arizona was leaving work, she saw Eliza crying in her car and hitting the steering wheel. This caused the horn to honk continuously. Arizona told her to pop the hood and she quickly pulled the horn wire, which she told Eliza she'd need to have fixed. Eliza thanked her and then they hugged. Arizona told Eliza that she could have friends at the hospital if she wanted. ''(\"[[It Only Gets Much Worse]]\")''\n\nAround the hospital, the two continued to pretend not to get along. However, at the end of the night, Arizona said she didn't want to pretend, because Eliza's nice and funny and people should know that. Eliza told her to be quiet and kissed her. ''(\"[[Back Where You Belong]]\")''\n\nEliza asked Arizona about how big her stove was, because she wanted to make Arizona pierogi. She then flirtatiously said, in Polish, that once Arizona had her pierogi, she'd never want anyone else's. However, that evening, when Eliza went to find Arizona, she was asleep on the couch. They agreed to rest for a minute and then rally, but they both fell asleep and when they woke up, it was morning. They leaned in for a kiss, but Richard Webber interrupted, discovering their relationship. ''(\"[[Civil War]]\")''\n\nAfter they'd been seeing each other for a while, Eliza told Arizona she was ready for them to have sex. They made plans for that night, but they were cancelled when one of Arizona's patients went into labor, but Arizona told Eliza that she looked for her around the hospital all the time and that the anticipation of waiting one more day wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. The next night, they left the hospital and went to Arizona's house, where they had sex. ''(\"[[Leave It Inside]]\")''\n\nAfter the hospital fire chaos had settled, Arizona found Eliza and suggested they go back to her place to have overly tired sex before getting some sleep. Eliza told her she couldn't. She needed to pack up her things because she'd been fired. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\nEliza \"ghosted\" Arizona, not replying to her messages and moving out of her apartment without saying a word to Arizona about it. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she started observing surgeries and giving tips at Grey Sloan Memorial, she immediately started to ruffle feathers with the other doctors, leading them to form an alliance against her.\n\n\nMinnick is a [[Board Certification|double-board certified]] [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic surgeon]], with a specialty in [[Orthopedic Surgery#Sub-Specialties|sports medicine]], and educational consultant.

As an intern, George got off to a rough start but quickly became a very skilled and talented surgeon. He was best friends with Izzie Stevens. He was married to [[Callie Torres]] but divorced after he cheated on her. He was kind-hearted, compassionate, and loyal. He died after jumping in front of a bus to save [[Amanda|a woman's life]].\n\n\n\nAs a child, he was teased by a neighbor, Mike Wilden. Eventually, he snapped and hit Mike's face with a stick. When Mike's father later came over and yelled at George's father, [[Harold O'Malley|Harold]] asked George if it was true. When George denied it, Harold and Mike's father got into a big fight. Harold believed George because he thought he never lied. As a result of the fight, Mike's family threw eggs at George's house and [[Ronny O'Malley|Ronny]] and [[Jerry O'Malley|Jerry]] blew up their lawn mower.\n\nIn school, George was a mathlete. He won a blue ribbon in science for dissecting a fetal pig and was secretary and treasurer of the ''Dungeons and Dragons'' club, which is another example of his difference from his brothers.\n\nHe asked a girl out to prom and she said yes. He was surprised since she was cooler than he was. On the night of the prom, he got his dad's car for the night and rented the most expensive tux he could afford. He and his date enjoyed the prom until there was an after-party that they were supposed to go to. As they were driving, she asked him to go to the local college and it turned out that she wanted him to drop her off at her boyfriend's dorm. He dropped her off and even waited to make sure that she arrived okay.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nHe went to medical school at the School of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\n[[File:xElevatorSurgery.jpg|thumb|xpx|George operates in the elevator.]]\nWhen George was an intern, he and Alex were treating a GSW (Gun Shot Wound) patient. They were in the elevator with him and it broke down. Burke squeezed some supplies through the elevator so they could perform the surgery and talked George through the steps. Alex was too scared to do it, although he never admitted it, and later he was made fun of because he chickened out. George successfully completed the procedure in the elevator and saved the patient's life.\n\n\nGeorge had a dislocated shoulder, and came to an orthopedic surgeon. Her name is Callie. She reduced George's shoulder. Later in the day, Callie and George met up and Callie wrote her number on George's hand. He called her, but hung up every time because he was nervous.\n\n\nGeorge's father told him before his death to be with Callie. Shortly after his death, George then proposed to Callie (later admitting he did so because she said she loved him and it was his father's dying wish for George to be with Callie). They got married in Vegas and George had a hard time as the other interns, especially Izzie, thought he made a mistake by marrying her.\n\nCallie was suspicious of George and Izzie's friendship and told George that she thought Izzie was in love with him. After this fight, George went to see Izzie and the two got very drunk and slept together. George felt extremely guilty for cheating on Callie but ultimately decided he was in love with Izzie, not Callie. Callie suspected George was having an affair and both Mark and Addison encouraged Callie to act on her suspicions.\n\nLater, George told Callie that he slept with Izzie.\n\n\nGeorge failed his exam because he had been distracted by all of his life problems on the day of the exam. He was trying to help Meredith with her problems with Derek and the death of her mother.\nGeorge had to retake his intern year, he was one of Meredith's interns. George tried to keep the fact he was retaking a secret from the other interns and was doing well with the help of his fellow intern Lexie Grey, but Alex told all of the other interns that were praising him that they really shouldn't because he is really a repeater. \n\n\nGeorge intended to transfer to [[Mercy West Medical Center|Mercy West]] after his internship. After failing his intern exam, George needed to repeat his intern year at Seattle Grace. As a repeat intern, George became popular among the new interns and eventually became the Chief's intern (a job that [[Richard Webber|Chief Webber]] made up for George). Soon, he and [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]], whom he moved in with after his break-up with Callie, discovered that he only failed his exam by one point. George then confronted the [[Richard Webber|Chief]] and asked to be allowed to retake the exam early. He passed and became a resident.\n\n\nGeorge had a complicated relationship with Izzie. They were best friends and roommates. He and Stevens shared many fond memories together such as talking about his crush and about \"Jimmy and the twins.\"\nGeorge slept with Izzie and they both admitted that they were in love with one another, their romantic relationship ended George's marriage with Callie. However, they had a short lived romantic history, which broke off eventually.\n\n\n\n\nAfter he joined the army to be a trauma surgeon, Richard gave him the last day in the hospital off to spend time with his family. On his way home, George jumped in front of a bus to save [[Amanda|a woman's]] life. No one knew who he was because he was unrecognizable until Meredith went into check on \"John Doe.\ud George took her hand and traced ''. Meredith quickly figured out that it was, in fact, George. Many people didn't believe that it was George because there was no proof that he really did trace . [[Callie Torres]] remembered that George had a birthmark on his hand that looked like Texas, so she went to check and found his birthmark on his hand. His brain swelled during surgery and he was ultimately declared brain dead. Most of his organs were donated following the surgery.\n\nHe was mentioned again when his mother was admitted to Seattle Grace Mercy West following a botched operation at another hospital. It is during her surgery that Miranda Bailey admitted to Meredith that George was her favorite intern.\n\n\nDay of the Dead\nGeorge was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nInside Meredith's Visions\nWhen Meredith was diagnosed with COVID-, she began to slip in and out of consciousness, often waking up on a beach. On a lifeguard tower on the beach Meredith meets George and the two reflect on George's death and their residency. Later Meredith told George how he affected and changed her life.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nGeorge was compassionate and kind. During his early years, he spent his time camping with his father and his brothers hunting turkeys, although George refused to kill one every single year. George was often teased by his brothers due to his apparent lack of masculinity.\n\nHe was also very emotionally attached to his dog Bucky, whom he thought had run away, not knowing that his father accidentally ran over and killed the dog after he was chasing after the truck and got caught under the tire. His father, knowing that George would be devastated, lied to him.\n\nGeorge O'Malley loved his friends and was always there for them. He was a loyal friend and he was always ready for anything, even if at first he doubted himself. He was passionate about his job and he enjoyed helping people whenever he could.\n\n\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\n[[File:xGizzie.jpg|thumb|left|px|George and Izzie become friends immediately.]]\ue\n\nAs Cristina and Meredith quickly became friends and the other interns disliked Alex, George and Izzie quickly made friends and soon became best friends. Together they realized that they only watched and they needed to become \"doers\". Their friendship remained strong, although George disliked her relationship with Alex. After George slept with Meredith, he moved out and blamed Izzie. While treating a patient, they became best friends again, and their patient told George that he and Izzie argued so much because they cared about each other so much. George moved back into the house, which made Izzie happy (although she strongly disliked his girlfriend, [[Callie Torres]]). Izzie made fun of Callie constantly, especially when she found out Callie's middle name was Iphegenia. After seeing the ring George got Callie, she said, \"Tiny diamonds are great because you know what? No one will ever try to steal it.\" Callie later told George that Izzie acted that way because she loved him.\n\n[[File:GizzieBadSex.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Izzie realize that it isn't the right time for them and stay friends.]]\nAfter an argument, George left to ask Izzie for her support. They started drinking heavily and woke up the next day after having sex. Only Izzie remembered but after a while, George did too. He decided to pretend it never happened and didn't tell Callie. However he and Izzie shared another kiss and on Cristina's wedding day she told him that she would support him and Callie if he loved her but that she still loved him. After eighteen days of ignoring her, George told Izzie he wanted to be with her too but he needed to break up with Callie first. It took a while but eventually he told Callie he slept with Izzie. However, she misunderstood him and forgave him and took him back. He and Callie divorced later and Izzie and George started up a relationship. However, after failing to recreate the great sex they had before, they decided that although they had great chemistry it wasn't the right time. They decided to stay friends and maybe have a romantic relationship someday. When Izzie started seeing Denny, George was the first to notice something was wrong but she denied any accusations. George took it hard when Izzie told Cristina about her cancer before him. He started to avoid her but almost immediately he befriended her again. He supported her through her cancer, reminding her she was a doer. When George was rushed into a surgery and Izzie started to flatline, in a dream of some sort she went into an elevator and then saw George when the doors opened signifying his death.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n[[File:O'Callie.jpg|thumb|left|px|The newly-weds, Callie and George]]\nAfter his disastrous incident with Meredith, George focused on avoiding her. However, he fell down the stairwell at Seattle Grace and went to ortho to get his arm fixed. He met Callie and she gave him her phone number. He didn't call her for a while so Callie refused to speak with him. However he soon called and she forgave him. They began dating, much to the disapproval of Izzie. At the prom, Callie confessed to George that she loved him, but he didn't respond, as Izzie needed him for an emergency. George later told her that he didn't love her yet, but he could, and he didn't want to say it until he really meant it. However, George continued to leave Callie whenever Izzie or Meredith had a problem, which prompted Callie to break up with him and start sleeping with Mark Sloan. After discovering that Callie was sleeping with Sloan he refused to have any relationship with her. But they grew close again when George's father was admitted, and they kissed. After George's father died, George became addicted to sex to forget about his pain, and later he proposed to Callie. They flew to Las Vegas, and after two weeks they returned to Seattle Grace as a married couple.\n\nAfter speaking with his friends, George became worried that he made the wrong decision but eventually decided that he did make the right choice. However, after a fight with Callie, he went to visit Izzie. They got drunk and had sex, but George believed it was a mistake and they should forget what happened. After sharing another kiss with Izzie in an elevator, he decided that he was going to transfer to Mercy West. He and Callie decided to start trying to have a baby, but Izzie told George that she still had feelings for him. After  days of avoiding her, he decided he wanted to be with her so told Callie about the affair. She misunderstood and forgave him and took him back but the situation was cleared up and they decided to divorce. After the divorce, they remained friends.\n\n\n[[Image:O'MalleyFamily.png|thumb|left|px|George's family (minus his father).]]\n[[Harold O'Malley|Harold]] and [[Louise O'Malley]]\nHe loved his parents very much. After his father died, he said he would've given his heart to him.\n\n[[Jerry O'Malley|Jerry]] and [[Ronny O'Malley]]\nGeorge never got on well with his brothers. His brothers were jocks and he was a mathlete. However, they still protected him when they felt they had to. When the O'Malley family fought with the Wilden family, Ronny and Jerry blew up the Wilden's lawnmower for George. Every year at Thanksgiving, the brothers and their father would hunt turkeys. George refused to shoot the turkey but after years of refusing, George eventually gave in so that he could go back home and stop having to \"choose a car\". After hearing that George only assisted in surgeries, his brothers refused to call him a \"real doctor\" and often made fun of him. Overall, George is very different from his brothers.\n\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\n[[File:Crapartment.jpg|thumb|right|px|Lexie steals for George.]]\nAfter being separated from his class, George befriended Lexie. Lexie became like a best friend to George, and they even rented an apartment together. However, the apartment was awful, so in an attempt to get George to stay at their \"crapartment\", Lexie began stealing things from the hospital. George stayed and they grew closer but he got mad at her after she revealed that he only failed his exam by one point. However, Lexie's snooping managed to get George another chance at taking his intern exam and in a rush of excitement, he kissed her and she realized she had feelings for him. She continued to stay his friend, secretly loving him, but after becoming a resident, he forgot about Lexie and all her help so she refused to speak to him. George realized she liked him, but after she forgave him, she started to take an interest in Mark instead, so they remained friends.\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nGeorge and Cristina had lots of problems with their friendship. Cristina always treated George like a child and eventually called him \"\" and \"Bambi\". George was also one of the first to find out about Burke and Cristina's relationship. When George moved in with the two of them, she walked around the apartment naked once and Burke kicked George out.\n\nThings got worse when Burke was shot and received surgery. After the procedure, Burke began to get tremors in his right hand, and in Cristina's attempt to protect Burke, she didn't tell anyone. When George found out, he remembered that Burke was scheduled to operate on his (George's) father. After this point, George and Cristina's relationship worsens. George later explains that the reason he chose Cristina and Burke to operate on his father was that Cristina was a robot, \"a robot in a white coat who never makes a mistake.\" Cristina even tells his mother, Louise, that George is the best intern and a good person, and that his mother raised a good human being.\n\nGeorge was angry at Cristina for hiding Burke's tremor, and when all the interns forgave her, he did not, telling Meredith that she was the one that started calling him , and he didn't owe her any kind of support. When George's father died, at the beginning he was not able to talk to anyone, yet Cristina allowed him to and told him her father also died when she was little and said she was sorry to welcome him to the \"Dead Dad's Club\"; she understood how it felt to be without a father. After this revelation, they seemed to be cordial to each other.\n\nWhen Cristina found out that George signed up for the army, she cared for him, yet she described him as \"the guy who gets killed while cleaning his own gun.\"\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[File:GeorgeMerSTimeOut.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Meredith apologize during a time-out.]]\nFrom the moment George O'Malley met Meredith, he fell in love with her. Meredith however, was in love with Derek Shepherd so she never really thought about George as more than a friend. Only a patient and George's best friend [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] knew how he felt about Meredith. After a small push from Izzie, George decided to tell Meredith how he felt. Meredith had had a very bad day at work so when George confessed his feelings for her, she thought that maybe George was her guy and she had just overlooked him. They proceeded to kiss but during sex, knowing it wasn't right, Meredith burst into tears. George was humiliated and furious and for weeks he refused to speak to her. Eventually he accepted her apology but admitted that he was partly to blame too, he had known how she felt about [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and knew she didn't love him.\n\nTheir friendship continued and he moved back to her house. When George discovered that he had to repeat his intern year, he drew away from his group of friends but things soon went back to normal and Meredith and George's friendship continued, and was strengthened as she was his resident. On George's last day at Seattle Grace, he was hit by a bus and nobody could recognize him. Meredith was his doctor and although she didn't communicate with him often, she defended him in front of some of the other doctors and after he traced the word \"[[]]\" on her hand, she realized it was him and had him rushed into the [[Operating Room|O.R.]]\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nEver since the start of their internship, Alex has disliked George. On their first day as interns, George was given the name  (when he froze in his first surgery) by Alex and it was the start of their mutual dislike for each other. Later on, George learned that he had contracted syphilis from his girlfriend Olivia. George was given the name \"Syph-boy\" by Cristina but soon learned that Alex was the person that gave syphilis to Olivia, which lead to Alex being punched by George. And on a different occasion, when Alex told George that Callie had slept with Mark Sloan, George went into denial and got into another fight with him.\n\nAlex repeatedly and frequently pointed out George's flaws - calling him weak and pathetic more than once - but Alex later revealed that he actually respected George and that if he were still alive then he would have beaten all the other residents at each milestone (st solo surgery, chief resident, etc.). Professionally, George had beaten Alex during important situations, even though Alex was better at poaching surgeries, George would have been better at dealing with emergency cases while Alex would just have frozen (e.g. heart in the elevator). Later, when George's mother returned, which brings back memories of George, Alex revealed to Cristina and Meredith that he didn't like to think of George because it reminded him of Izzie (his ex-wife) which brought pain.\n\nOver the years, Alex\us views on George softened. When Meredith, Callie, and Alex were discussing all of the different doctors that lived in Meredith's house, George was brought up and Alex made a somber toast in his honor, showing that he truly did see him as a friend.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nIn the beginning, Miranda Bailey didn't care much for George. She treated him the same as any other intern, but after George helped deliver [[William George Bailey Jones|her baby]] when she was going through a rough time; she gained so much respect and gratitude for him. She even named her child after him, giving him the middle name George. Although there was never a strong friendship, they gained a bond beyond professional. When Miranda heard George had signed up for the army, she, along with Callie, tried her best to convince him not to go. When George died, she suffered a great loss. Later, when George's mother came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] for a surgery, Miranda wanted to make sure she got the best possible treatment. During surgery, Miranda revealed to Meredith that George was her favorite intern and was very saddened by his death, showing that she cared a tremendous amount for George O'Malley.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nSince George failed his first intern exam, Richard was more interested in the potential and knowledge that George had. Richard often gave guidance to George and helped him through many of his surgeries. After George passed away, Richard was very moved and sad. In a conversation with [[Derek Shepherd]], he let him know that he was teaching George so Derek could later take over for him as Chief of Surgery of Seattle Grace.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nWhen Owen and George were operating, Owen immediately saw that George had talent for [[Trauma Surgery]]. Eventually, Owen focused his teaching on George. Later, behind the scenes, Owen told George that he should join the army, and that George is going to be one of the finest trauma surgeons he's ever known. George's plans were stopped in their tracks, however, when he got hit by a bus and died in surgery.\n\nWhen he realized that George was brain-dead, Owen asked Chief Webber if he was a donor, since he could save many lives.\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\nUpon first meeting George, Burke disliked him. George accidentally offended him and Burke chose George to be the intern he punished a lot which would force the others to fall in line. He allowed George to scrub in with him on his first day and insulted and terrified him. However, after working on more cases, George and Burke grew to have a friendship and Preston christened George his \"guy.\ud When George moved out of Meredith's house and had nowhere to go, Burke allowed him to sleep at his apartment. They went running together and acted like a team constantly. Eventually, Cristina managed to get George to move out but he and Burke remained friends, even after he left Cristina on their wedding day.\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nGeorge initially disliked Shepherd because of the latter's relationship with Meredith. During his neurosurgery rotation, he called out on the anesthesiologist Dr. Taylor after smelling alcohol in his breath but was dismissed by Shepherd. When Dr. Taylor fell asleep during surgery, Shepherd promptly kicked him out. After the surgery, Derek commended George for speaking up and admitted that he, as the main surgeon and attending in charge, was at fault for failing to notice Dr. Taylor's breath.\n\nGeorge died on Shepherd's operating table. Shepherd had saved him the first time but he coded the second time as his injuries were too extensive.\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\nGeorge didn't have a close relationship with Sadie. He also didn't understand how Meredith could be friends with her. During the intern bowl, he noticed Sadie didn't have the basic medical knowledge for her level. He also caught her cheating to win. George offered her assistance, but at the end, he gave her an ultimatum that he would tell the chief or she would have to. After that, Sadie quit and called George an \"ass.\ud\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\nWhile not known for being friendly towards interns and residents, Erica Hahn did not seem to treat George any differently from other interns and residents. She did not seem to have a problem with him being in her O.R. Before starting her employment as head of cardiothoracic surgery at Seattle Grace, George 'hired' her to operate on his father as he knew of Preston Burke's tremor following his gunshot wound. Despite clashing with George during her tenure as his father's surgeon, she did not appear to hold this against him during her time at SG. George managed to talk two of Hahn's reluctant patients into having surgery. Hahn was [[Haunt You Every Day|called to]] Seattle Grace to harvest a heart from a brain-dead car accident victim whose father was in the hospital awaiting a heart transplant. He refused to take his daughter's heart. However, he agreed after George told him he would have donated his heart to his father if it would have saved him. George later also talked a frightened -year-old into having heart surgery after showing him the inside of an O.R. so he would know how things worked in there and would no longer be scared. While Hahn originally refused, she eventually consented to the plan.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|xpx|George holds a dress for Mark.]]\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMark Sloan disliked most interns and George was no exception. After George and Callie divorced, Mark decided to humiliate George for Callie so when two patients were admitted in a competition which involved holding a wedding dress, Mark ordered George to hold the dress while he treated one of the girls.<ref>[[Kung Fu Fighting]], x</ref> However, at Lexie's request, Sloan vowed that he would become less cruel to O'Malley.\n\n\nAmanda\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|ox|Amanda stays with George.]]\nGeorge met Amanda the day before he left to join the army. They met at a bus stop but when he smiled at her and she ignored him, interested in finding better-looking guys, a bus almost hit Amanda. George threw himself under it and pushed her out of the way, saving her life. They were brought to Seattle Grace, George's face unrecognizable and Amanda's arm in a sling. Because nobody knew who the John Doe was, no family was called so Amanda refused to leave his side. She stayed with him as much as possible. Before discovering it was George, Meredith said to him that he ''\"...made a good friend there. Guess thats what happens when you take a bus for someone.\ud''\n\n[[Carlos Torres]]\n[[File:George&Mr.TorresS.jpg|thumb|left|px|Mr. Torres holds George by the neck.]]\nWhen Mr. Torres first met George, he mistrusted him because he assumed that George had married Callie for her money. It didn't help that George was hungover. Callie, her father, and George met at Joe's bar where they discussed finance and how George apparently talked too much. However, when Mr. Torres started talking about giving them money, George refused it having just remembered sleeping with Izzie the previous night. Mr. Torres later approached him and told him that he just wanted to protect his daughter and warned George not to hurt her. Months later after George and Callie's divorce, Mr. Torres came to visit his daughter at Seattle Grace. When he spotted George he pushed him up against a wall and threatened to kill him for cheating on Callie but Callie told her father that she had cheated on him with Mark too. Mr. Torres dropped George who ran away and grabbed Mark Sloan instead.\n\n\nHe attended [[Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine]].\n\nWhen George applied to become an [[Internship|intern]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]], he barely made it into the program (although George later discovered he had the most, and best, recommendation letters). During the beginning of his internship, he was picked by Dr. [[Preston Burke]] to perform the first surgery of all the interns. During the surgery, he almost killed the patient and earned the nickname \"\" (after James Bond's License to Kill). Later in their intern year, George and [[Alex Karev]] get stuck in an elevator with a patient who has been shot. The patient begins to bleed out and when Alex freezes up, Burke has to talk George through surgery and George \"flies solo\" for the first time.\n\nAt the end of his intern year, George failed his intern exams. By the time the summer ended, George seemed to have changed his mind and went ahead with repeating his internship with Meredith as his resident.\n\nInitially, none of the new interns knew that George was a repeat intern. Lexie kept his secret and stayed by his side as a friend when all of the other interns find out about it. He moves in with her and starts accepting and living with what he has, befriending the other interns and hosting a party at their ugly apartment (or as they called it, ''[[The Crapartment|crapartment)]]''. It was later revealed that George failed the intern exam by only  point and received  outstanding letters of recommendation, making him and Lexie doubt his repeated internship even more. During a brief outburst at the chief, George is allowed to retake the intern exam. When he comes home to Lexie, they share a brief celebratory kiss although just as friends (although Lexie looked hopeful for more). George finally passes his intern exam, after a little difficulty from a hospital flooding and after a little friction with his interns, he became as qualified as the rest and as Izzie tells him he is the best, putting the most time into teaching and hours in the skill lab.\n\nOwen Hunt joins the hospital, he notices George's talent in trauma surgery and urges him to choose Trauma as his specialty. After connecting with a patient from Iraq, who like himself, had a family completely different from him, George decided to go to be commissioned as a medical officer in the Army and serve in Iraq.\n\nAfter telling the Chief of his decision, he was given the day off to spend some time with his family before he left, preventing an intervention by Bailey, Callie, Meredith, Cristina, Izzie, and Alex. The same day, a patient was admitted after jumping in front of a bus to save a woman, his face unrecognizable with severe injuries to his left arm, head, face, pelvis, and abdomen. Meredith was the resident assigned to the case and remained with the patient, and he attempted to communicate with her using his hand due to him being intubated. The second attempt to communicate with Meredith, he wrote down the numbers '''' for her. Initially confused, Meredith realized that it was George writing his nickname. She got up and told all the other doctors. George was rushed into surgery while Izzie coded. In some sort of afterlife, dream, or hallucination, the two met, Izzie in her prom dress and George in an army uniform.\n[[File:GeorgeinUniform.jpeg|thumb|George in his army uniform.|xpx]]\n\n\n*He was the first main character to perform a surgery, to call time of death, and to inform a relative about a patient's death.\n*He and Lexie nicknamed their apartment ''[[The Crapartment]]''.\n*He had a freckle in the shape of Texas on his right hand.<ref>[[Good Mourning]], x</ref>\n*George could play the clarinet.\n*He had a Catholic background.\n*In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, [[Shonda Rhimes]] had said that she requested [[T.R.

She is the ex-girlfriend of [[Arizona Robbins]] and wife of [[Maya Bishop|Maya DeLuca-Bishop]].\n\n\n\nWhile her mother moved to the United States with her little brother, Carina stayed in Italy with their father.<ref>https://twitter.com/KristaVernoff/status/</ref>\n\nAfter he and [[Sam Bello]] broke up the first time, Andrew spent three weeks on her couch.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Carina learned that her brother was working for a female Chief of Surgery, she came to Seattle to meet with [[Miranda Bailey]] about doing her research at Grey Sloan Memorial. She talked with Bailey and got permission to use the hospital's MRI to take pictures of women's brains before, during, and after orgasm.\n\nAmelia offered to participate in the study and her MRI showed a brain tumor.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Carina learned that Arizona had a patient who was having a difficult, slow labor and couldn't use any medical means to hasten her labor, she suggested clitoral stimulation to provide natural pain relief and speed up her labor. Despite her initial reservations, Arizona suggested it to her patient and with her husband's assistance, labor quickly progressed.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nWhile watching Amelia's surgery with Arizona, Carina was delighted that Amelia's tumor had been discovered because of masturbation, saying God works in mysterious ways.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nAs they were bonding over strange objects they have pulled from people's bodies, Richard invited her to the intern mixer and she happily accepted the invitation. At the mixer, she got acquainted with Owen, who mistook her for an intern. She clarified she was a visiting doctor and that her specialty was orgasms. This sparked his interest and after some flirting, they ended up kissing in a hallway.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nPeggy and her wife came into the hospital when Peggy panicked during their planned home birth. When the power went out for a moment, Peggy panicked again and tried to leave for another hospital, but Arizona determined that her baby's head was already out and then coached her as Carina delivered the baby in the hallway.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref>\n\nCarina later told Arizona that Peggy was healing and happily in love with her new daughter.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nWhen a psych consult for a patient who tried to cut off his hand because he was masturbating and believed it was sinful was delayed, they asked Carina to step in and talk to him because it was her area of expertise. She told him that God made sex pleasurable beyond procreation for a reason. She also admitted that she does it and wasn't ashamed of that. When he developed an erection, he covered himself with a pillow and demanded that she leave immediately, which she did.<ref>[[Personal Jesus]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a conversation with Carina about maternal mortality, Arizona was inspired to look into it and learned that the US has a much higher rate of death for new mothers than Italy. She wanted to study why this happened and how they could prevent it. After writing a proposal, Arizona went to Carina and asked if they could work together. In addition to that, they rekindled their romance.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nCarina went to [[Kate Lachman]] to get access to the patient files, but due to a misunderstanding, Kate declined. When Arizona stepped in, she gave them access. The research showed a climbing rate of c-sections, starting when Kate started working at the hospital. She encouraged Arizona to tell Kate about it, which Arizona did, offending Kate.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nTheir research continued and Carina believed it was making Arizona more paranoid when she demanded every possible tool they need be nearby when [[Lanie]] was delivering her baby, despite a lack of complications. After the baby was born, Carina told Arizona that everything had gone well, but when another new mother suddenly hemorrhaged, Arizona used a cart she'd had Levi put together and then modified to suit her needs to rush to her aid. They were able to save her life and stop the bleeding quickly. Arizona told Carina she thought their research was done. The solution was the cart, which was stocked with everything they could possibly need.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the time came for Arizona and Carina to present their research for consideration, she was paged away for a laboring patient and wished Arizona luck. After hearing that Arizona had accidentally distributed and consumed weed cookies, Carina offered her a ride home.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith went to Arizona to try to get Andrew off her couch, where he'd spent a whole week, Arizona referred her to Carina, who had admitted to Arizona that she doesn't believe in coddling children and believed Arizona was coddling Sofia. Carina came over to Meredith's house and got Andrew up off the couch and back to work.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Carina was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. When Taryn got drunk and said she was going to confess her love to Meredith, Carina stopped her, saying love's too precious to waste it on someone who can't love you back. After the wedding planner ended up having an allergic reaction to shrimp and was sent to the hospital, the wedding party and guests then boarded a ferry, where Alex and Jo were married by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Barry Clemens]] came into the ER with something stuck in his rectum, Richard paged Carina for her help in determining what the object was. With her help, they got Barry to confess on his way to surgery that he had put his wife's \"hair stuff\" up there. After Barry died in surgery, Richard asked for her help explaining it to his wife.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\n\nCarina told Andrew she'd probably have to leave town and go back to Italy for a bit because there were problems with their papa.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nCarina came back to Seattle after several months. She came to Andrew's place and revealed that she'd brought their father back with her.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen her father pitched his research, which involved creating a gestational sac to allow premature babies to continue to live outside the uterus, Carina was reluctant to support it because of her father's untreated mental health issues. She went to Alex with her concerns, but Vincenzo's project was funded anyway.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nCarina continued to watch her father while he worked on his project. When one of the lambs died, she wanted him to stop his research, but he said she didn't know what she was talking about and dismissed her concerns. When he learned she was working on a patient who was going to lose her baby because she needed a hysterectomy and the fetus was not yet viable, he went around Carina and talked to the parents about using his gestational sac. The parents wanted to try it, but they were quickly told that it wasn't available for use yet. Instead, Carina delivered the baby and then Teddy removed her uterus. The baby was then wrapped in a blanket and given to her father, who held her while she died. Because of what he'd done, Alex decided to cut funding to Vincenzo's research, which upset him.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy started having pains, she saw Carina, who diagnosed cervical insufficiency and put her in Trendelenburg.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy went into labor, Carina came and attended her birth.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia approached Carina to ask her to be part of a threesome with her and Link. However, Carina assumed she was instead coming to her about her pregnancy, as she'd seen the changes in Amelia's body. Amelia said she wasn't pregnant, just gaining a little weight, then awkwardly tried to proposition Carina. Carina just waited while Amelia realized that she was, in fact, pregnant.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Bailey started bleeding while she was at work, she went to Carina, who did an ultrasound that showed she'd lost the pregnancy. She told Bailey she just had to wait. When Ben arrived, Carina left them alone together after telling Ben she was sorry. Later that day, she did an ultrasound on Amelia, who hadn't gotten one because she was worried that what happened with Christopher would happen again. Carina assured her that everything was fine, but told her she wasn't twenty weeks pregnant as she believed, but twenty-four, injecting doubt as to the paternity.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\n\nCarina became increasingly concerned when she noticed that Andrew seemed to be struggling particularly hard with [[Suzanne Britland]]. She went to Meredith with her concerns, saying Andrew was the same age as as their father when he started showing symptoms of bipolar disorder. She also pointed out past events that showed similar alternating mania and depression, which led to Meredith going to Bailey and getting Andrew taken off the case.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after that, Carina became even more concerned when Andrew decided to walk to Seattle Pres during a blizzard to retrieve a liver for [[Elisa Tang]]. She called him every fifteen minutes while he was out. When he returned with severe frostbite, she tried to get him to understand that what he did wasn't normal or rational. He brushed off her concerns and said that his actions saved Elisa's life.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\n[[Maya Bishop]], captain of [[Station ]], came running into Grey Sloan after a bear attacked a civilian while the team was nearby on a camping trip. The civilian was rushed to the hospital with the help of the team, but was missing his nose. By the time they found it, the civilian had been taken to the hospital. When they arrived at the hospital with the nose, Maya brought it in side and unknowingly caught Carina's eye. They serendipitously met up at a bar later that night and Carina introduced herself. Maya let her initial offer of a drink down, telling Carina she was looking to drink alone, but when Carina asked if she was sure, Maya changed her mind.\n\nWhen [[JJ Lau|JJ]] went into labor at the station during the blizzard, Maya called Carina for advice on things they could do to make her more comfortable. Carina suggested putting her in the shower with warm water to ease some of her discomfort. Later, Carina suggested that JJ masturbate to ease her pain and speed up labor, which she did happily. Soon afterward, she gave birth.<ref>[[Ice Ice Baby]], x (S)</ref>\n\nCarina and Maya continued to hook up happily. When Carina heard from Ben that Maya had had a rough day, she brought lasagna to the station for Maya. Maya said they were just hooking up and she didn't need a girlfriend, so Carina put down the lasagna and went to leave, but Maya stopped her and apologized. She said she was broken. Carina said she's not in the habit of fixing broken people, but instead of leaving, she started kissing Maya, who said the lasagna smelled almost as good as Carina.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], x (S)</ref>\n\nCarina was present when Andrew started demanding that [[Opal]] be arrested for human trafficking. She cried and begged Andrew to stop and get help. When he finally left the circle they'd made, Carina followed him, though he brushed her off.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nAfter being told she could learn to rest and love in life, Maya invited Carina to take a few days off with her and go on vacation, which an invitation Carina accepted.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOn their vacation, Carina quickly noticed that Maya's head still seemed to be back in Seattle. She showed off her bikini and used it to entice Maya into bed. Then they finally left their room. While they were enjoying drinks by the side of the pool, [[Todd (No Days Off)|Todd]] came by and flirted with them. When he wouldn't back off, Maya challenged him to a push-up competition. She easily won the competition, winning herself and Carina a round of drinks on him and the ability to go back to their peaceful vacation. Later, back in their room, Maya received a notification on her phone of a -alarm fire back in Seattle. She immediately started to have a panic attack, so Carina talked to her and got her to breathe and calm down.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Amelia's water broke, she went to OB, where Carina examined her and determined that she was already at five centimeters. Amelia admitted she'd been having contractions since that morning, but ignored them because she thought they were Braxton Hicks again. Carina continued to monitor her as her labor progressed. When Link was needed for Richard's surgery, Carina said they still had hours left. He left and Amelia continued her labor and gave birth to a healthy baby.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nCarina was at the station making out with Maya when Maya's mother came in. Carina introduced herself and was mistaken for a firefighter and Maya's doctor before excusing herself away. Later, she returned to the station and helped Maya's mother, Katherine, set up for the spaghetti dinner they were having that night. Carina was shocked to hear of the abuse they were put through and tried to comfort Maya. Maya made it clear that she didn't see her father's actions as abuse and left. Carina later went to Maya's office, where she was crying at her desk. She shared her own experience with her father's mental state and said denial was a powerful drug. Maya said she wasn't in denial, that she was just angry, so Carina got up and left.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter that meeting, Carina checked in with Maya, asking how she was dealing with the new information. Maya continued to deny that her father was abusive because he'd never hit them. Carina shared her own experience with her father and said just because he never hit her or her bother doesn't meant they weren't abused. Maya didn't agree and when Carina wouldn't drop it, she said she needed to go for a run. Hours later, Maya returned and was surprised to find Carina still there. Carina said she thought about leaving, and giving Maya space, but she wanted to be there in case Maya wanted to talk. Maya told Carina to give her space and leave, also adding that she'd slept with Jack that evening.<ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nCarina was on the front lines of the COVID- pandemic as Grey Sloan was turned into the city's most prominent COVID treatment center. She and Maya moved in together at Maya's apartment so they could spend time together while complying with the quarantining rules. \n\nOne day, she ran into an agitated Andrew in the hospital parking lot as he pointed out [[Opal]], a woman suspected of child trafficking who previously managed to escape from the hospital due to Andrew's untreated bipolar disorder causing him to chaotically share his suspicions. Andrew was determined to not let her get away this time. He assured Carina that he was sure and that he had been taking meds and gotten enough rest. Carina believed him and agreed to follow Opal but insisted she drive. They rushed to her car and pursued Opal.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nThey tailed her and called the police, who found Andrew's story lacking evidence. They called Maya and Ben, who got involved and cut through the red tape to get police involved after all. After witnessing her making some kind of transaction in an alley, they followed her to a train station. Despite Carina's warnings, they followed her onto the train. As they reminisced about their childhood in Italy, Opal ended up spotting and recognizing Andrew. She got off at the next station. Andrew pursued her by himself. Opal managed to get away but was arrested outside the station. However, she had one of her companions stab Andrew as he pursued her. Carina found Andrew bleeding out on the floor and called for help. He was transported to Grey Sloan, where Teddy Altman and Owen Hunt fixed the damage to his diaphragm and ventricle. Carina awaited news on his status in the chapel with Maya and went to his see him in the ICU. However, later, he developed a cardiac tamponade. He was rushed back to the OR but he died on the table due to coagulopathy.\n\nCarina grieved his death at Maya's apartment. Maya helped her let it out by allowing her to scream covered by the engine's sirens. Carina was surprised when a friend of hers from med school, [[Gabriella Aurora]], dropped by the apartment to comfort her and reminisce about their years in med school and residency. When the President closed all immigration offices due to the pandemic, problems with Carina's visa could not be resolved. She did not mind as she had felt some sort of pull to go back to Italy to help out as it was one of the countries hit the hardest by the pandemic. She got her old job at the Paolo Calvino Hospital back and prepared to temporarily move back until the pandemic had settled and she could get the problems with her visa settled. Maya initially planned to move with her but her obligations as Captain in the midst of a growing war with the police department kept her from doing so, which Carina completely understood. \n\n\nShe is a feisty and confident woman. She is passionate about her family, especially Andrew and Maya, she loves them deeply.\n\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nSoon after arriving in [[Seattle]], she met [[Arizona Robbins]] at a bar. She ended up going home with Arizona and the two had sex.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nEven after Andrew came home and interrupted the events, they continued. The next day, when Arizona found out that Carina was at the hospital doing research, she went to see her and Carina continued her flirting.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nArizona described the sex the two of them had as pain-relieving.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Sofia was coming back home, Arizona inadvertently broke things off with Carina.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|px|thumb|Arizona and Carina kiss.]]\n\nAfter not seeing Arizona for a few days, Carina asked her if she was okay. Arizona said she'd taken a few days off after [[Karin Taylor|Karin Taylor's]] death. Arizona was shocked to learn Carina had never lost a mom, while Carina was shocked to learn Arizona had lost more than one. That inspired Arizona to look into it as a surgical project and once she had written up a proposal, she asked Carina to work on it with her, a decision they sealed with a kiss.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Carina made a comment about moving countries at the drop of a hat, Arizona asked her if she was just going to leave suddenly and end their relationship. Carina said that she had no plans to leave or end their relationship.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Arizona decided she needed to move herself and Sofia back to New York, she ended things with Carina.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nAfter things ended with Arizona, she met Owen at the new intern mixer. They flirted and then started kissing at the hospital.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nThings progressed from there to her making breakfast naked with him.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nAfter their tryst, things were awkward between them around the hospital.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\n[[Maya Bishop]]\nMaya caught Carina's eye when she ran into the ER with [[Scott Burke|Scott Burke's]] nose.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> Later that night, they met again at the bar and introduced themselves. Carina started flirting and offered to buy Maya a drink in exchange for the story of how she ended up running a nose into the hospital. Maya tried to turn her down, but Carina asked if she was sure and Maya gave in.<ref>[[Into the Woods]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey continued to hook up and Maya called Carina for help when JJ went into labor at the station.<ref>[[Ice Ice Baby]], x (S)</ref> When Carina heard about Maya having a bad day at work, she brought lasagna to cheer her up. Maya snapped at her, saying she didn't need a girlfriend and they were just hooking up, shocking Carina. Maya quickly apologized and accepted the lasagna.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter dealing with an accident in which a drunk driver took out  people on motorcycles, Maya called Carina to hook up. After they hooked up, Carina tried to excuse herself to go back to work, but Maya started crying, saying she was the truck that ran into station  and broke up a family. Carina held her and comforted her.<ref>[[Born to Run]], x (S)</ref> Maya then concluded that she wanted to step down to allow Andy to take her right place as Captain. The day she planned to tell Sullivan that, Carina told her to speak her truth.<ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey later went on vacation together, the first vacation Maya had taken in her adult life. While on the vacation, Maya had a panic attack, but Carina was able to calm her down.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTheir relationship hit a snag when Maya's mother came to visit and revealed that she'd been in therapy and was leaving Maya's father because he was abusive. Maya refused to accept that that was true, even when Carina shared her own experience with her father.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x (S)</ref> Carina continued to try to get Maya to accept that what her father had done to her was abuse, but Maya refused to accept it. Maya eventually left to go exercise at the station. While she was there, she ran into Jack. They fought and then had sex. When she returned home, Carina was still there waiting for her and she told Carina she'd slept with Jack. <ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref> They broke up as a result of Maya's actions. However, after Maya's father visited her at work and assaulted her at a fire, she realized Carina had been right. She found Carina at the hospital and apologized, saying she loved Carina and she'd never said that to anyone but her brother before, so it was a big deal. With encouragement from Teddy, Carina told Maya she loved her, too.<ref>[[Louder Than a Bomb]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen the pandemic hit Seattle, Maya and Carina didn't get to see much of each other aside from the occasional video call. They later decided they would move in together so they could spend more time with each other.<ref>[[Wild World]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nShe is Andrew's older sister. When he moved to the United States with their mother, she stayed behind in Italy with their father.\n\nWhen their mom went to Italy to visit Carina, she called Andrew to say their mom was sick and he needed to come immediately. When he arrived, he learned his mom had died before Carina even called, but she explained that she couldn't stand the thought of him knowing their mom was dead without her being there to hug him.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nShe cares very deeply about her brother, despite feeling he's an idiot. When she learned that his ex-girlfriend, [[Sam Bello|Sam]], was working at the hospital and he'd had sex with her, she reminded him of the time he spent three weeks on her couch because of Sam.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nWhen ICE came for Sam at the hospital, Andrew went to Carina and ask if she had called them. She denied it, saying she wouldn't do that to Sam or to Andrew.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nBecause of what happened with their mother, Andrew was worried when Carina said their papa was having problems. She assured Andrew that he wasn't dead.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nShe lost a grandmother and several uncles to COVID.<ref>[[Save Yourself]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nCarina is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where she is regarded as the best OB on staff.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref> She went to med school in Italy and finished residency at the Paolo Calvino Hospital. When she failed to get funding for her research into female orgasms and the pain-control aspect of it, she visited her brother at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] in order to ask its female Chief, [[Miranda Bailey]], for permission to use their MRI to carry out her project. Having secured funding by using drug companies' interest in developing a female viagra, she was finally able to get her study going.\n\nShe was granted privileges when the OB/GYN department became short-staffed and ended up becoming part of the staff. When her visa was expiring in the middle of the COVID- pandemic, she decided to temporarily return to Italy to help out in her home country. She got her job at the Paolo Calvino Hospital back but ended up being re-hired at Grey Sloan when she decided to only go to Italy for a month.\n\n\n*She is Italian and speaks fluent Italian.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n*She doesn't believe in coddling children.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n*She had her first job at age nine, sweeping the floor of a cafe.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n*She once stole a lipstick from a drug store.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n*She'd never lost a mother in childbirth until the Covid- pandemic.<ref>[[Wild World]], x (S)</ref>\n*She once pulled $, in cash out of a woman who wanted to hide it from her ex-husband.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxCarinaDeLuca.png\nxCarinaDeLuca.png\nSxCarinaDeLuca.png\nSxCarinaDeLuca.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Carina-centric or are otherwise very informative about her life.\n*[[Train in Vain]]\n*[[Learning to Fly]]\n*[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\n*[[Comfortably Numb]]\n*[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]\n\n\n:Marry me.

She wanted to test how long it would take before someone took a look at her, and when April finally approached her, she told her she'd been  minutes in the ER bed. ''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:MeetingRichard.png|thumb|px|Alana meeting Richard again.]]\nAfter she met up with Owen, he gave her a tour around the hospital. She met Derek, and told him she'd watch his surgery the next day. While informing Owen on the waiting time in the ER, they ran into Richard Webber. Alana was one his students. At first, Richard thought she came to the hospital looking to join the staff.\ua\n\nThey also ran into Arizona, who was trying to relax in one of the lounges. While entering the lounge, Alana told Owen she'd be looking at everything in the hospital. Alex informed her on a pediatric case, and she shared a conversation with him and Arizona. She told she'd watch her surgery the next day.\n\n[[File:ORObserving.png|thumb|left|px|Alana watches Alex stabbing Arizona in her prosthetic foot.]]The next day, she was trying to fit in as many surgeries as possible in her schedule. Jo Wilson deliberately changed the hour of Derek's surgery on the OR board, so Cahill wouldn't be there.\n\nDuring Arizona's surgery, Alana talked to Owen about the Africa program. When Arizona started to suffer from phantom limb, Dr. Cahill questioned if Arizona even should be allowed in that OR. Too busy to help Arizona, Owen revealed that Derek's surgery had started hours ago, making her leave the gallery to go observe Derek. However, he threw her out of his OR and she walked back in right at the time Owen ordered Alex to stab Arizona's prosthetic with a scalpel. Alana then figured out why Arizona had been acting so strange the past days. ''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\")''\n\n\nDuring a staff meeting, Alana told the doctors she was impressed by what she had seen the past three days. She especially praised the Africa program, saying it was good publicity for the hospital and that she didn't feel like cutting it. However, she did say she would have to make cuts. She surprisingly proposed to close the ER, claiming it was hemorrhaging resources.\ua''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\"\u)''\n\nAlana had cameras placed all over the CCU. On the other side of the cameras is a remote physician., who is there to help reduce mistakes, improve patient care and maximize physician hours. She also made sure that the OR's were arranged with maximum efficiency, specifically for OR turnovers.\uaAlana also demanded that the doctors' average time between surgeries,  minutes, would be cut in half.\n\nShe also brought in a doctor to teach the general surgeons a new technique for a hernia repair, claiming it was needed to standardize OR procedures.[[File:ClosedER.png|thumb|px|Owen closes the ER.]]\n\nShe wanted to replace the ER, which was open for one more day, with something she had yet to think about. She sent workmen to measure it up, but Owen sent them off because he didn't want them to be there while the ER was still open.\n\nTrying to save the ER, April and Derek created a whole plan to make budget cuts in every department. When they proudly presented it to Cahill, she said that the hospital couldn't be saved by making budgets cuts, but that it had to be bought. She revealed that she had to make the hospital presentable, and that the ER had to go.\ua''(\"[[Bad Blood]]\")''\n\n\nAlana Cahill managed to find a buyer for the hospital, a group of businessmen named Pegasus. After modernizing the hospital with tablets, she gave them a tour around the hospital, exactly at the time when April brought in a trauma patient. In the empty ER, which was being turned into a hernia clinic, April and several other doctors gave the patient first aid care.[[File:BloodGround.png|thumb|px|Alana notices blood on the ground in the ER.]]\n\nWhen Cahill and a few members of Pegasus were about to visit the ER, Derek managed to distract them long enough so the patient could be moved to an OR. While talking to the Pegasus members about the hernia clinic, Cahill noticed some blood on the floor. It didn't take her long to figure out that someone brought in a trauma patient. She left the Pegasus members with Derek, ordering him to continue the tour.\uaShe found out that April, Meredith and Cristina were operating on the trauma patient. However, Meredith \"accidentally\" deleted the patient's file on the new tablets.\n\n[[File:DerekSpeech.png|thumb|left|px|Alana telling Derek that Pegasus is the only option left for the hospital.]]Cahill then decided to interrogate every doctor involved, starting with the interns. Alex and Jackson then confessed, claiming it was the right thing to do. Owen let them go unpunished, much to Alana's surprise. She paged Shepherd, telling him she knew he helped the other doctors because it was his code that accessed the medication case on the fifth floor. Cahill then reveals that if the kid had died, it would've cost the hospital a lot of money and it would have made Pegasus back out. She revealed Pegasus to be the only option left, and said that if the staff continued to undermine her, the hospital wouldn't stay open.\ua\n\nDuring all this, Callie and Richard visited another hospital that was owned by Pegasus. What they saw there didn't please them, and what the doctors there told them didn't sound good at all. Callie then proposed to the doctors who were involved in the plane crash to buy the hospital themselves.\ua''(\"[[The Face of Change]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:DerekPoster.png|thumb|px|The promo poster with Derek on it.]]\nLike in the other hospitals Pegasus owned, she chose a doctor to promote the hospital. Derek got appointed as face of the hospital, making brochures and giant posters with his face on them. Derek disliked them, but she refused to have them taken down because they served as promotional material for the hospital. The nurses didn't like all the changes, and they all threatened to quit. Cahill needed Owen to talk them out of it. He was successful in doing so.\n\nWhile Alana and Owen were dealing with the nurses, the last thing that had to be dealt with before the hospital could be sold, the group of doctors who were in the plane crash and Callie all come to the conclusion that they should buy the hospital themselves, as Pegasus wouldn't do any good to the hospital.[[File:YelledAt.png|thumb|left|px|Alana gets yelled at by a hospital board member because Pegasus withdrew the offer.]] However, Pegasus moved up the sale to that night, leaving them with too little time to come up with a decent plan. Therefore, they saw only one option left to postpone the sale. During the meeting, Derek, Meredith, Callie, Arizona and Cristina resigned, completely changing the value of the hospital and making Pegasus back out.\n\nAlana was left startled and yelled at by one of the board members and Owen. She stammered she couldn't salvage the sale because there was no way she could replace these doctors and that she couldn't reposition or find new buyers. Owen told her she had to save the sale.\ua''(\"[[Hard Bargain]]\")''\n\nShe did manage to get Pegasus back in, but their counteroffer was to buy the hospital for parts, liquidating its assets and laying off its staff. Alana informed the hospital board, having them pull together an emergency meeting to discuss it. However, like\ua[[Roberta Thompson]]\uatold Alana, the hospital needed an offer, and this was the only one, leaving them with no other choice.\ua[[File:AnotherBuyer.png|thumb|px|Owen tells Alana and the board that the group of doctors wants to buy the hospital.]]\n\nCristina told Owen about their plan to buy the hospital. During the emergency meeting, he walked in and told the board and Alana about the doctors' plan, convincing the hospital board to wait another day. Cahill tried to persuade the board not to wait, because then Pegasus would lose interest for good. However, the board listened to Owen and decided to let the doctors buy the hospital.\n\nWhen Julian Crest refused to invest in the hospital, the doctors' plan had failed and they couldn't buy the hospital. With no offer from Pegasus left, there was no hope for the hospital anymore. Everyone got ready for the hospital to close its doors. Alana thereby didn't manage to save the hospital, but\ua[[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]]\uadid by having the\ua[[Harper Avery]]\uafoundation invest in the hospital.\ua''(\"[[This is Why We Fight]]\")''\n\n\nDr. Cahill was a student of Richard Webber, and he described her as a great student and a gifted surgeon.\n\nHowever, during a surgery, Alana choked. She said that was the reason she left the OR to become a physician advisor. She told Owen she saved a dozen of hospitals before she came to Seattle.\n\nAt the end of her third day in the hospital, Richard said she was judging harshly, but Alana claimed that was part of her job. She also said that during her intern year, Richard said to her that medicine was constantly changing and that she had to be part of the change or get out. She then said that she was making changes, and that he should be proud of her.\n\nAlana said to Owen she was very good at her job. She proved this by making Pegasus interested again in buying the hospital, after they previously backed out because Derek, Meredith, Callie, Arizona, and Cristina all resigned.\n\n\n*She hums to herself while operating.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[Walking on a Dream]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[Bad Blood]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[The Face of Change]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[Hard Bargain]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[This is Why We Fight]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n:'''Alana:'''\uaWell, I'll see you in the OR tomorrow.\n:'''[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]:'''\uaTypically, you need to be invited.\n:'''Alana:'''\uaIf things were running typically, I wouldn't be here, now would I?\n\n\n{{Alana Cahill Appearances}}\n[[de:Alana Cahill]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cahill, Alana}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

But she believed it was more, because Andy was falling down on the soccer field. So she took him to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], where [[Arizona Robbins]] examined him. After talking through it with [[Miranda Bailey]], Arizona said that he had a mild case of scoliosis and his growth was likely aggravating his spine. She said they'd wait to see if it resolved and if it didn't, he'd come back in for more tests. In the meantime, she gave him a prescription for muscle relaxants.\n\nHe later came back to the hospital with serious pain in his inguinal area, legs, and back. He'd been vomiting all night. Arizona wanted to run a D MRI, but his mother's insurance wouldn't pay for it, so [[Richard Webber|Webber]] wouldn't let her run it, so she was forced to discharge him and refer him back to his primary care physician.

According to Catherine, this would be the first penis transplant conducted in the USA.\n\nRyan was taken into surgery later that day. Besides Meredith and Jackson, who were scrubbing in, Catherine invited Mark, who had initially challenged her on her approach, to assist. The surgery started off well. However, Meredith had to leave after Cristina came into the OR to inform her that the case Alex had to attend was Zola who had been hospitalized with a serious bowel obstruction.

''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\nAfter he peed on Izzie's bed, she insisted that they get rid of him. George backed her up, saying either the dog goes or he goes. When Meredith hesitated, he said he'd be moving out. Izzie made up a flyer to try to get someone else to take Doc. At the end of the day, Izzie refused to take Doc home, so Meredith took him out to [[Derek's Trailer]], where he went to live with Derek and Addison. ''(\"[[Tell Me Sweet Little Lies]]\")''\n\nDespite him living with Derek and Addison, Meredith continued to see Doc, even meeting Derek in the park so they could walk him together. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Doc suddenly became sick, Derek took him to the vet. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\nFinn ran some tests and said Doc could go home while he waited for the results. Derek took him home, but brought him back that evening, saying he was listless and hadn't eaten all day. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nThe tests revealed that Doc had bone cancer. Finn gave them treatment options, but Derek suggested that it might be more humane to put him down. After consulting with [[Callie Torres]], Meredith realized that Doc wasn't going to get better, a conclusion she confirmed with Finn. He said the best case scenario is that Doc has a year left, but Doc wasn't the best case scenario. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\n\nDoc's cancer spread to his brain and they made the decision to put him to sleep. Although Finn had the means of disposing him, Meredith did not want him thrown away like garbage and so Derek agreed to have him buried at the clearing by trailer, overlooking the water. After he was given the injection, Meredith and Derek stayed with him while he died.

He fell four stories and was impaled on standing rebar. Despite being impaled on three metal bars, he was optimistic, saying that if they hadn't caught him, he'd be a stain on the pavement. He was taken directly to the OR from the ER.\n\nOne of the poles was near his carotid, but hadn't severed it. One was in the right upper quadrant and had likely missed his liver. And his femoral artery was intact. Because the bars were rough metal, they risked further damage pulling them out. They tried bone cutters to cut the bars close to his body, but they didn't work. Leon, who was still conscious, told them that they needed a .\" angle grinder with a cutoff wheel. However, just before they began to cut the bar, Owen and Ben came into the OR and stopped them, saying that the grinding metal would cause sparks, which, given the oxygen flow in the OR, could cause a serious fire.\n\nThey figured out they could remove as much oxygen as possible from the room and manually ventilate him then cut until his oxygen dropped too low. It took them a while, but they finally cut through the bars and were able to proceed with the surgery.\n\nAll in all, it was an uncomplicated surgery.

She just bought you a hospital.|'''Catherine Fox''' to '''[[Jackson Avery]]'''}}\n\n'''Catherine Fox''' (formerly '''Avery''') is an attending [[Urology|urologist]] at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] and a part-time [[Attending|staff surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Her husband is [[Richard Webber]] and her son is [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]]. She's also the founder and current board chairman of the Catherine Fox Foundation.\n\n\n\nCatherine Avery first came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] when she performed a penile transplant on [[Ryan]]. She presented the case at grand rounds and then set all the residents up in a lab to see who would win the chance to assist her in the OR. Jackson and Meredith were the last two standing and scrubbed in to assist, along with Mark. When Meredith had to step out in the middle of the operation, April, who was observing and who had helped retrieve the graft, was selected to step in. When April suctioned too aggressively, Mark and Jackson had to harvest a new vein to graft blood flow. The surgery was finished successfully and Ryan was pleased with the end result. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine returned to Seattle to help reconstruct the bladder of [[Irene]]. They'd used her own stem cells to grow a bladder that her body wouldn't reject. The surgery went well and Irene's urinary incontinence was resolved. She brought along her fellow, [[Mara Keaton]], with the hopes of getting more information about Jackson's personal life. Jackson figured out her plan and refused to tell Mara anything. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\n\nShe originally planned for Jackson to be her date to the benefit, but he backed out and convinced Mara also not to attend. She tried to get Richard to attend with her, but he also declined, feeling disloyal to his wife. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine was a proctor at the oral boards the same year her son was taking them. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")''\n\nJackson was rattled because he could hear her through the walls as he was trying to concentrate on his test, after finding out that she had slept with Richard the night before.\n\nCatherine later told Richard that she'd checked with some of her friends and found out that one of the Seattle Grace doctors didn't pass. She worried that Jackson had failed because he was traumatized by what he'd seen. ''(\"[[Let the Bad Times Roll]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine returned to the hospital again to treat [[Bryan Greenberg]], who had scrotal lymphedema. During that visit, April also avoided her because she knew Catherine would figure out she'd been having sex because she was obsessed with April's sex life. ''(\"[[I Saw Her Standing There]]\")''\n\n\nAfter a conversation with [[Richard Webber]] regarding their primary investor, [[Julian Crest]], falling through, Catherine Avery, along with the [[Harper Avery Foundation]], decided to contribute the necessary funds to purchase [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. As a caveat, however, Catherine wanted a representative of their choosing to sit on the board as chairman and selected her son, [[Jackson Avery]]. ''(\"[[This is Why We Fight]]\")''\n\nRichard believed that it was too much responsibility for Jackson to handle, but Catherine assured him that Jackson could handle it as he's an Avery. She gave him tips to help him and he ultimately stepped up to the challenge. ''(\"[[Transplant Wasteland]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard was electrocuted, Catherine came to the hospital and immediately criticized how his case was being handled. Catherine wanted to move him to another hospital, but he'd listed Meredith as his medical proxy, so she didn't have the authority. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n\nShe later believed his recovery was being hindered by the staff at the hospital, whom she said were coddling him because they love and fear him. She was impressed when she saw Richard demanding that his staff treat him as they would any other patient. ''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\n\nOn Richard's birthday, Catherine told him she'd be around, so he assumed they'd be doing something for his birthday, like a party. They later went to get dinner and she led him into his surprise party. ''(\"[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine presented the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]] the year Cristina was nominated. However, the award was given to someone else. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nShe later told Richard that Cristina had the votes, but had lost because of the Harper Avery Foundation's interest in the hospital. They didn't want it to look like she won simply because the Harper Avery Foundation owns the hospital. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she learned April was pregnant, Catherine came to visit Seattle to see her and Jackson. While she was there, there was an explosion at a mall. When she saw April worried about the state of the world and raising her child in it, she told April that the world changed by good people raising their babies right and told April she'd be okay. ''(\"[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\")''\n\nWhen April and Jackson learned that their baby had osteogenesis imperfecta and was in pain as his bones were already breaking, Catherine came to Seattle and told April to set aside a day, during which they'd induce labor and she'd have him baptized right in the hospital room, then she could hold him until he died. ''(\"[[All I Could Do Was Cry]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thomas Archibald]] came into the hospital after his wife cut his penis off upon finding out he was cheating with his sous-chef, Catherine, who was in town for a conference, was called in to re-attach it. The reattachment was successful, but shortly thereafter, his penis was cut off again. The second re-attachment was also successful. ''(\"[[Crazy Love]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] stepped down as [[Chief of Surgery]], the board needed to vote in a new Chief. ''(\"[[Time Stops]]\")'' Richard suggested [[Miranda Bailey]], but Catherine insisted that she go against an outside candidate of her own choosing. ''(\"[[You're My Home]]\")''\n\nShe brought in [[Tracy McConnell]], but [[Miranda Bailey]] ultimately won and was named the new Chief of Surgery. ''(\"[[Sledgehammer]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she found out April was pregnant again, Catherine came to Seattle. She spoke to April about her own experience with pregnancy and the seemingly peaceful conversation led April to extend an olive branch to Jackson. However, Catherine revealed to him that she had talked to April to get proof that April had committed fraud so they could go after her. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\nShe tried to get Jackson to make a case for getting sole custody once the baby was born, but instead, he tried approaching April peacefully, which worked. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Catherine planned a visit to Seattle, Richard planned a small get-together with a few friends. However, she surprised him by showing up a week early, saying she couldn't wait to see him. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\n\nAfter April gave birth to her daughter, Catherine came to visit them both. She was delighted to hear they'd named the baby Harriet but dismayed to learn the baby's last name wasn't Avery. When she questioned why they couldn't hyphenate, Jackson told her they had. The baby's last name was Kepner-Avery. ''(\"[[Undo]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine came to the hospital to meet with Bailey about Alex. She believed Bailey was being too lenient and wanted Bailey to replace Alex. At the end of the day, Bailey took a stand and said she wasn't going to fire Alex. Catherine said that was fine, but then said too many people had gotten second chances and she wondered why they needed them in the first place. She wanted to work on the surgical residency program to return it to its former glory. ''(\"[[Roar]]\")''\n\nAs a solution, she hired [[Eliza Minnick]]. ''(\"[[Why Try to Change Me Now]]\")''\n\nWhen Catherine came back to check on Bailey's progress, she was shocked to hear how resistant the attendings were to the change. She offered to let Bailey release her on them if she needed. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\nRichard learned that it had been her decision to hire Eliza to replace him, making him feel betrayed. ''(\"[[It Only Gets Much Worse]]\")''\n\n\nWhile working together at the hospital, Catherine butted heads with both Jackson and Richard over what she had done. They continued to fight as they treated a patient together. ''(\"[[Civil War]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine watched Harriet for a few days while April and Jackson went to Montana for a case. While Jackson was there, he met up with his estranged father and made peace with him not being around. When Jackson returned to Seattle, he thanked his mother for everything she'd done for him. ''(\"[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine attended the press conference about Meredith and Nathan's work on the plane. ''(\"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Catherine learned about the hospital fire and Stephanie being taken by a rapist, she called Bailey, Richard, and Eliza into a room and questioned how it happened and why it took so long to find Stephanie. Eliza told her about forgetting to tell the cops about Stephanie being missing because she was following protocol and evacuating patients. This upset Bailey, who fired Eliza on the spot, saying they had no room for someone who didn't know when to violate protocol. She didn't want a place that churned out surgical robots. She wanted their program to raise surgeons. Catherine started to object, but Bailey said she was the chief and she'd made her decision. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\n\nHarper and Catherine came to town to look over the expenditures at the hospital as part of the renovation after the fire. After reviewing the numbers, Harper wanted to pull out the [[Harper Avery Foundation]] funding. Bailey explained to him why he shouldn't do that and he agreed not to pull out, but then he fired Bailey instead. Catherine told Bailey she'd go to bat against Harper for her, but before she could, they found Harper dead in the conference room. ''(\"[[Go Big or Go Home]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Harper's funeral, which she said was full of people saying only positive things about Harper, Catherine and Richard had a family dinner with Jackson and Maggie, at which she revealed that Jackson was inheriting millions of dollars from his grandfather. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was nominated for a Harper Avery Award, Catherine invited her, Maggie, and Zola to join herself and Jackson on a private plane to Boston for the ceremony. Catherine was annoyed when Meredith instead stayed behind to treat a patient. At the ceremony, Catherine presented the award to Meredith and Jackson accepted it on her behalf and gave a speech about the loss she'd overcome. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Bailey was hospitalized for a heart attack, Catherine brought food and beverages to the hospital for Richard and Ben. ''(\"[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine came to the hospital with her friend, [[Michelle Velez]], so Michelle could pitch to them a project idea, using herself as a patient, for a new technique for vaginoplasties as part of gender-confirmation surgery. After the proposal, Catherine was upset because Jackson wanted to work on a different project instead. She had [[Dahlia Qadri]] write up a proposal for the vaginoplasty as well as Jackson's other idea. Jackson was convinced to choose to work on the vaginoplasty. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Michelle's surgery, Catherine and Jackson were fighting about him seeing Maggie, so Michelle started to back out. She refused to have the surgery until her surgeons were both on the same page and ready to focus on her because she only had one shot and wanted it to go well. Under her gaze, they worked out their disagreement. Catherine admitted that she didn't want it to affect her own relationship, which is why she was worried about it. Then they operated together and it went well. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard sat by [[Olive Warner|Olive's]] bedside while she died, Catherine took him food and drinks and sat with him for periods of time. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\nWhen an NDA signed after a lawsuit with Harper was preventing Amelia from getting access to research from [[Rebecca Froy]], Jackson had the legal team waive the NDA, after Catherine told him it was a minor spat over some research. However, she later told Richard that Jackson had ruined them. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\nCatherine immediately started to do damage control to protect the foundation as more allegations came to light. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\nAs word spread that Harper Avery had assaulted multiple women, Catherine hired [[Erin Mason]] to do crisis management. She suggested creating good PR by having Jackson do a charitable surgery and then having someone take the fall. Because she'd signed the settlements with the women, Catherine suggested herself, over Jackson and Richard's objections. With Erin's help, she drafted a statement taking the blame, but then Jackson and Meredith interrupted the meeting and showed her a statement they'd written in which they pledged to re-train and re-hire all the affected women under a new foundation, in Catherine's name. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Catherine was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. After the wedding planner ended up having an allergic reaction to shrimp and was sent to the hospital, the wedding party and guests then boarded a ferry, where Alex and Jo were married by Meredith. Catherine also ordered food to Jackson's place so the party could continue there. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nDuring her visits to Seattle, Catherine continued to spend time with Richard, which he enjoyed and said helped him sleep a lot better. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine had neck and back pain for weeks. When it became intolerable, she had some scans run, which showed a large spinal tumor. She called Koracick and Meredith to LA under the guise of a VIP patient. When they arrived, she showed them the scans and then told them she was the patient. They did a biopsy to look for cancer, which they found. The tumor was very aggressive, which worried Tom. Catherine talked about all the things she had survived and challenged Tom to help her survive this. ''(\"[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\")''\n\nWhen she found out that Meredith had told Maggie about the diagnosis, she fired Meredith from her team and advised her to keep away until the fury passed. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine had been working with [[Uma Paxton]], who had a recurrent vaginal tumor. She developed a surgical technique that would allow Uma to keep her uterus, preserving her fertility. However, when they operated, the tissue proved to be too friable, forcing them to perform a hysterectomy. Catherine was upset because she had told Uma she could do it and failed. After the surgery, she told Uma, who cried. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nThe day came for Catherine to have her surgery. Before her surgery, Jackson played \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" and they had a dance party in the OR. Then she was put under. Despite having to change the surgical plan to remove the tumor in pieces and open her from the front as well as the back, she woke up after surgery. When they told her they'd had to leave a small piece of the tumor behind, she said what was important was that she'd live. She'd need frequent scans to check on the tumor and would live with cancer probably for the rest of her life, but she'd be able to live that life. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\nAfter her surgery, Catherine had trouble accepting help. She hired a physical therapist, [[Marsha (Girlfriend in a Coma)|Marsha]], to give her some exercises she could do to get herself back to normal. However, she felt Marsha was condescending and resisted her help. After weeks of physical therapy, she finally felt able to do things by herself. On Valentine's Day, she and Richard were able to reconnect sexually. ''(\"[[Girlfriend in a Coma]]\")''\n\n\nTo celebrate her doctors and her survival, Catherine had Jackson throw a party, though she said she didn't want a large one. However, on the day of the party, she avoided going, saying she was hesitant to celebrate because she still has cancer and it's not over. Bailey convinced her to go to the party anyway and celebrate her life because she still has it. They went to the party, but before they could even finish toasting, a plastic pan accidentally placed in the oven forced a building evacuation. Catherine then decided to take Richard, Jackson, and Maggie to get some food, establishing a new tradition for after every scan she had to get, good or bad. ''(\"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine was brought in for the case of [[Caleb Hicks]], who had lost his penis and scrotum in an accident. The surgery was scheduled, but then it came out that Caleb didn't have the support system in a fianc\uee as he had claimed, as he'd actually broken up with her. Catherine canceled the surgery over his objections but later agreed to do it after he talked to Owen and reunited with his fianc\uee. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine came in unexpectedly to have a meeting with the insurance provider for the hospital employees after they believed they had a case of insurance fraud on their hands. After talking to the insurance company for over an hour, Bailey called Andrew into the room to ask him about [[Gabriella Rivera]] and her time at the hospital. He told them he had been the one to put down Ellis's name on the insurance forms and she accompanied him to the hyperbaric chamber so he could tell Meredith what he'd done and apologize. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nDue to the fraud that had taken place, Bailey and Catherine looked into Gabby's case themselves. When Gabby's cancer was found to be stage , they told her father it was highly treatable and survivable and Catherine pledged that the Foundation would cover all her treatment and associated costs, so he wouldn't have to worry about that. She also shared that she had cancer and was living with it.\n\nLater, Catherine and Bailey had a meeting with Meredith, who confessed what she had done. Alex and Richard then came in and confessed their parts in it, so Bailey fired all three of them. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\nAs a result of Bailey firing three of their best doctors, Catherine decided to hire [[Tom Koracick]] to oversee all the Catherine Fox Foundation doctors, including Grey Sloan Memorial. Bailey was irritated at having Tom be above her, but Catherine said it was what she felt she needed to do after what Bailey did with Meredith, Alex, and Richard. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine came back to Seattle and was working at Grey Sloan again. When she got a call that Richard's niece was at Pac-North, she went over there, where she saw Richard sitting with Gemma. Richard tried to explain to Catherine, but she said he was saying a lot for someone who didn't do anything wrong. Later, she talked to Gemma and said they were always looking for accountants for the Fox Foundation and had openings all over the country, though none in Seattle. She returned to wait with Richard and Chris until Maggie came out and informed them that Sabi had died. Catherine led Richard to help call the rest of the family. ''(\"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Catherine and Richard decided to separate, they invited Maggie and Jackson over for dinner to tell them. A wrench was thrown into their plans with Jackson invited Vic, who in turn brought Dean. An awkward dinner ensured. At the end of the dinner, they announced that they were separating. ''(\"[[The Last Supper]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine gathered with others at the hospital to watch the livestream of Richard's presentation of his PATH pen. She noticed something was wrong immediately when he mentioned fine-tuning his presentation with her help, which had not happened. They watched as he continued to present without making sense. They then watched as Maggie and Cormac led him off the stage and then the feed was cut. ''(\"[[Love of My Life]]\")''\n\nCatherine flew to Los Angeles and then she and Richard flew back to Seattle. Back at the hospital, she reassured him that he'd be okay and told the doctors, including Jackson, they needed to work harder to figure out what was wrong with him. ''(\"[[Sing It Again]]\")''\n\nAfter two weeks of testing and research, the doctors hadn't come up with a diagnosis other than Alzheimer's that fit his symptoms, so Catherine decided just to take him home. As they were leaving, Richard mentioned that his feet were tingling, which Meredith noted was inconsistent with the Alzheimer's diagnosis. She ran an EMG, which showed nerve degeneration, which meant his symptoms were physical as well as mental. They planned a nerve biopsy, but before they could do it, Andrew came into the OR and desterilized the instruments. He then told them Richard likely had cobalt poisoning from a hip replacement he'd had in Boston three years prior. He was immediately taken into surgery to have the old hip removed and replaced. Link found that the hip joint had broken down significantly, allowing the cobalt to leech into his body and cause all his symptoms. Link cleaned out the old hardware and replaced it. After his surgery, Richard was stable and back to normal. Catherine said she was having a bed brought in so she could spend the night, but Richard said he didn't want her to because of what she'd done, despite her having been by his side during his hospitalization. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n\nAbout a month into the pandemic, Catherine came to Seattle to have a budget meeting with Maggie. She considered the amount of money Maggie was asking for unreasonable, but the two of them vented together about the circumstances they were in and how it was all out of their control. She also met with Bailey about budget issues. Then she fired Koracick and hired Richard in his place, which helped lead to their reconciliation. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Andrew died, Catherine comforted Richard as he made plans for a memorial service, as they were unable to hold a funeral due to the pandemic. Later, when Richard confessed to struggling with everything, Catherine told him her latest scan had shown that none of her cancer had grown. She encouraged him to look for the good things. Later, Catherine attended Andrew's memorial service with Richard. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Irene Davis]] came to the hospital with a kidney stone, Catherine did a lithotripsy to break up the stone and remove it. When she tried to remove the scope afterward, Irene's ureter came with it, forcing them to convert to an exploratory laparotomy. The remaining ureter wasn't long enough to re-attach it to the kidney, so she had to remove Irene's kidney and then do autotransplantation to preserve her kidney function. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nAfter putting together a proposal for free COVID testing and treatment, Jackson and Alma sent that proposal on to Catherine for her consideration. Catherine told Jackson she'd resist the proposal when revenues improved, though he knew by then it would be too late. At the end of the day, he asked her why she never took him to protests or got involved on the ground floor. She tried to defend herself, but he was annoyed at all the barriers that were keeping people from getting the help they needed. She told him he sounded like his father, which he didn't think was necessarily a bad thing, a comment that upset her. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\nAfter a visit with his father, Jackson came to Catherine and told her he wanted to take over the Foundation and change its purpose to put money toward helping the most marginalized people. Catherine was initially shocked, but later told Richard she was proud of Jackson. ''(\"[[Look Up Child]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. When [[Bill Pierce]] and [[Antoinette Ndugu]] opposed the wedding, it was postponed until April . Catherine later attended the proper wedding. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard took back over as residency director, he decided to employ what he called The Webber Method. Catherine was reluctant, but eventually agreed. The idea was to allow the residents to operate on several patients who needed cholecystectomies, with the schedule staggered so the attending could rotate through and be available during the most complicated part to help. Despite one complication, the day went through successfully and thirteen patients were treated. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nWhen Levi made a mistake in surgery which resulted in the death of [[Devon Gomez]], an M&M was assembled to discuss how his death could have been prevented. Catherine came to the M&M to support Richard. At the same time, The Webber Method was suspended and was under review. After the M&M, Catherine told Bailey it was up to her if The Webber Method would continue or be permanently discontinued. Bailey decided it would be discontinued. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\nRichard called Levi every day, which he told Catherine he would continue to do until Levi called him back or returned to work. After making an error with [[Ivan|a patient]] one day, Richard came home and said that because of that error and the situation with Levi, he wanted all of his faculties tested and said he would stop operating if his skills didn't pass muster. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Nick Marsh]] came to Seattle to do a kidney xenotransplant, Catherine sent him a private jet and a stretch limo to bring him to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the surgical residency program at Grey Sloan Memorial was put on probation, Catherine came to Seattle and told Bailey she needed to make sure all the residents would say positive things about the program before she attempted to hire staff to cover the surgeon shortage. She was angered when Bailey instead told [[Jordan Wright (Character)|Jordan Wright]] to go back to [[Mayo Clinic]] because if the program were shut down, he wasn't guaranteed to get a replacement residency spot and she cared about his medical education. Catherine was further angered by Meredith's decision to leave Seattle to take a job of her own at Mayo Clinic and berated Meredith over it until Addison told her to stop. At the end of the day, Catherine was shocked when Bailey put on her coat and said she was taking a vacation. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\nCatherine stayed in Seattle had breakfast with Helen Anderson at the Medical Accreditation Council in the hopes she could help them saved the residency program. At the end of the day, she came to the hospital because Meredith had called her after Richard accidentally ingested a marijuana-infused drink Catherine had left in the fridge. Richard questioned why she would have that temptation in their house for him. She told him it was for her pain, as her cancer had progressed. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine began chemotherapy treatments at Grey Sloan Memorial as part of a trial Richard got her into. Richard sat with her during her treatments, reading about various clinical trials and looking for anything with promising results. While in treatment, she began speaking to [[Simon Clark|Simon]] and [[Kristen Clark]]. After he began to think Catherine might be continuing treatment only for him, he told her if was okay not to. She assured him she didn't want to stop treatment. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\nWhile undergoing these treatments, Catherine forced her loved ones to eulogize her in life, saying it wasn't fair to have to wait until she was dead to hear them say nice things about her. When she learned that her cancer was responding to treatment, meaning she was no longer dying from cancer but living with it, she and Richard decided to take a sabbatical so they could travel together. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\nMonths later, after their routine, Catherine had a scan, which showed her tumor was  millimeters bitter than her scan two months prior. Tom reminded her that at the last scan, it had grown and she promised to consider more treatment if it grew more. She and Tom reviewed some studies, but she decided not to seek more treatment and also refused to tell Jackson and Richard, despite Tom's pleading, saying she didn't want it weighing as a dark cloud over them. ''(\"[[When I Get to the Border]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Robert Avery]]\nCatherine was married to Robert Avery, who is the father of Jackson. It was revealed that he tried to take Jackson across the country away from Catherine, but she wouldn't put up with it and sued him for parental rights. He is currently estranged from Jackson. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nWhen Catherine returned to the hospital for a bladder transplant using a bladder they had grown from scratch, Catherine openly flirted with Richard. Initially, he flirted back with her because he considered it innocent. When Jackson ditched her as her date for a benefit, Catherine asked Richard to be her date and he agreed. However, that evening, he told her he was afraid he couldn't accompany her because his wife was in a home with Alzheimer's. Adele didn't recognize him anymore and he missed talking to her and laughing with her. He didn't feel like a man anymore with Adele, and Catherine's flirting made him feel like a man again. That made him not trust himself to go to dinner with Catherine. She told him he was a good man and they hugged, after which he left to go see Adele. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\nThey met again at the boards, where they both were examiners. They had dinner together and he confessed he hadn't seen Adele in a long time, as it only seemed to confuse her more. They continued their flirting and after she got the check, they ended up kissing in her hotel room. He hesitated before progressing, but a loving look from Catherine convinced him to proceed. Jackson found out about their night together when he came to her room to ask for his lucky pencil. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")''\n\nRichard and Catherine didn't regret their night together. Catherine had a short conversation with Jackson where she told him she was a woman with needs. After the boards were over, during their goodbye, Catherine and Richard discovered they were both speaking at an upcoming conference. They compared agendas and made plans to stay in the same hotel. ''(\"[[Let the Bad Times Roll]]\")''\n\nThey continue to develop this relationship. Following the death of [[Adele Webber|his wife]], Catherine sent him a box of cookies and offered companionship. ''(\"[[The End is the Beginning is the End]]\")''\n\nWhen it looked like Seattle Grace Mercy West was going to be sold to Pegasus Horizons, Richard contemplated moving to Boston to be closer to her. However, she suggested the [[Harper Avery Foundation]] could put up the remaining capital they needed in exchange for a seat on the board. ''(\"[[This is Why We Fight]]\")''\n\nWhen Cristina Yang didn't win the Harper Avery Award, Richard Webber came to Boston. He was planning to propose but questioned the foundation's decision to give the award to someone else. When Catherine admitted that she had the votes, but didn't win because the Harper Avery Foundation owns the hospital, he showed her the ring and told her she ruined it and left. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nThey avoided each other during subsequent visits, but when Catherine learned that April and Jackson's baby was going to die, Richard decided to be available in case she needed him. She initially told him she wanted to be alone, but later asked him to take her home and hold her. ''(\"[[All I Could Do Was Cry]]\")''\n\nAfterward, he tried to get her to give Jackson and April space to grieve alone, but she insisted on asked Jackson how April was doing. Richard felt used, believing she'd used visiting him as an excuse to check on April. ''(\"[[The Great Pretender]]\")''\n\nWhen April later called Catherine to the hospital to re-attach a man's penis, Richard tried to stop her. He told Catherine she'd hurt his feelings. She said it had happened with many men before and he said that it would probably happen again, but it was worth the risk. ''(\"[[Crazy Love]]\")''\n\nWhen Richard later tried to propose to her on the th of July, she stopped him before he could get the ring out, saying he shouldn't ask without knowing the answer. However, the following Valentine's Day, she took the reins and proposed to him herself, making it a romantic gesture with candles and roses. He accepted. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\nAfter a tunnel collapse botched their original wedding plans, they married in a small ceremony in the hospital chapel, with the reception following at [[The Dream House]]. Before the wedding, they argued and Catherine took off her ring, but Meredith told them to work it out because they'll never have enough time to be with the people they love. ''(\"[[You're My Home]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship was strained when he learned that she had decided to hire Eliza to replace him, not Bailey. ''(\"[[It Only Gets Much Worse]]\")''\n\nAfter speaking with Bailey about how their lives had taken similar paths and neither of them knew how to be married at first, Catherine went to Richard and admitted she was wrong, starting them on the path to reconciliation. ''(\"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\")''\n\nFor her birthday, Richard took salsa dancing lessons and surprised her at Joe's with a dance in front of their colleagues. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship was strained again when Bailey fired Richard while Catherine watched. Richard was angry with Catherine for not intervening and began to avoid her at home and elsewhere. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\nCatherine came back to town to find Richard sleeping late into the day. He confirmed that he'd worked all night and came home to sleep after breakfast, leaving out that he'd had breakfast with [[Gemma Larson|Gemma]], who kissed him and propositioned him. She told Richard to go back to sleep. ''(\"[[Breathe Again]]\")''\n\nWhile back in Seattle, Catherine went to Pac-North to visit Richard. However, when she asked an intern where his office was, she was upset to learn that he was in his office with a woman the intern believed to be his wife. She told Jackson about this, thinking Richard was cheating on her. Jackson tried to reassure her, but she ended up leaving for Chicago without seeing Richard. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nThings were still tense between them weeks later. She was suspicious when she learned Richard hadn't gone to work one day, even after he told her he'd spent the day with Maggie. She said it was time for them to have a bigger talk. ''(\"[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]]\")''\n\nShe and Richard hosted a dinner to tell Jackson and Maggie that they were separated, but they put it off when Jackson brought guests. After dinner, she and Richard almost stayed together when hearing a sentimental story, but she couldn't apologize. This led to them finally telling everyone at the dinner party about their separation. ''(\"[[The Last Supper]]\")''\n\nCatherine came to the hospital and sat at Richard's bedside while he was sick. When they couldn't figure out what was wrong with him, she wanted to take him home. However, as she prepared to take him home, Meredith noticed a new symptom. He was diagnosed with cobalt poisoning from a hip replacement he'd had three years prior. After he had surgery to remove the bad hip, he quickly improved and pushed Catherine away. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\nThe two of them remained separated until after he returned to work. However, after talked to Jackson and Maggie, he went to Catherine. She fired Tom as Chief of Chiefs and hired Richard in his place. The two of them then reconciled. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nJackson Avery is her son. He gets irritated easily because she butts into his personal life. Even though he didn't tell her Lexie's name when they were dating, she revealed that she knew it and said she had her ways when he questioned her. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\nWhen Jackson started seeing Stephanie, Catherine walked in on the two of them having sex, giving her a bad first impression of Stephanie. After working with Stephanie on a case, however, she agreed to forget the incident and start fresh. ''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\nWhen he eloped with April, she insisted on them drawing up and signing a post-nuptial agreement in order to protect the Avery assets. They did so, forcing themselves to confront how different their plans for their future children were. ''(\"[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]\")''\n\nShe told April that when she was pregnant with him, she was always tired and swollen. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\nShe became a Grandmother when Jackson's daughter with April arrived via emergency c-section.\n\nWhen Jackson visited his father, Robert Avery, Jackson realized that Robert wasn't his dad because he hadn't been involved in his life. When he got back from Montana, he thanked Catherine for everything and hugged her. ''(\"[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]]\")''\n\nParents\nShe lost her mother when she was very young. Then her father died on his way to church when she was , leaving her to raise her sisters on her own. ''(\"[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\")''\n\n\n[[Michelle Velez]]\nShe and Michelle are long-time friends. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\n[[Tom Koracick]]\nShe has a history with Koracick. They flirted a little bit when they ran into each other again at the hospital and she invited him to return for lectures in the future. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\nTom later told Meredith that Catherine was the one who woke him back up after his son died, reminding him that he was still alive and shouldn't sleepwalk through his life. ''(\"[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Urology|urologist]] at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]]. She is also the chairman of the board of the Catherine Fox Foundation.\n\nShe occasionally consulted at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] and performed the country's first penile transplant there. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\nIn , she served as a [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|board examiner]] in San Francisco, CA. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")'' Between  and , Catherine Avery joined the surgical staff of [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], at least part-time, as she has scheduled surgeries when she's in Seattle.\n\n\n*When Catherine visits, she brings her own lab coat from [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]].

She told them Cristina was unresponsive until they tried to examine her, which was when she became violent. She tried to warn Owen not to loosen the ties around Cristina's arms, but he didn't listen to her advice.\n\nLooking at the scans of [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona's]] leg, Dr. Krieger told Owen she officially recommended amputation due the extensive bone injury and soft tissue infection.

She is the biological child of [[Ellis Grey]] and [[Richard Webber]] and thus half-sister to [[Meredith Grey]]. She is married to [[Winston Ndugu]].\n\n\n\nMaggie is very driven and finished both high school and medical school faster than normal. She worked extremely hard and was a focused student. She states that she graduated early from Yale, but it is unknown whether this was in reference to undergrad or medical school.\ua\n\n\nMaggie interviewed for the position of head of cardiothoracic surgery at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She was hired soon after. Her flight to Seattle from Boston was one of the worst flying experiences ever. Due to some technical issue, the plane stayed on the tarmac and the passengers had to remain in their seats. It was very hot on the plane and they were not allowed to use the restroom or given any water. Eventually, after four hours, the flight was just cancelled with no apology whatsoever.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x </ref>\n\nTwo weeks after being hired, Maggie told [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] that she was adopted, and that  years prior, she looked for her birth mom and needed to go to the court for the records. She found out that she was dead, but got her name, and discovered that she was an amazing surgeon that worked at the [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], now [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], Maggie's current workplace. She stated that that's not why she took the job, but it's \"a little bit\" why she took the interview. When Richard asked Maggie what her mother's name was, she said that it was [[Ellis Grey]].<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nMaggie quickly began to integrate into the hospital, getting to know everyone, and how things work. However, she butted heads with [[Meredith Grey]] over a case. This came to a head when Maggie told Meredith that Ellis Grey is her birth mom.<ref>[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]], x</ref>\n\n\nDerek and Meredith decided to have Maggie come over to their house for dinner, to get to know Maggie better. After Maggie said yes, Derek thought it was a good idea to ask Richard as well. Richard at first thought it was a bad idea because Maggie was going and he didn't want to ruin it, because Maggie and Richard were not okay. The night of the dinner, Maggie and Richard showed up, but no one opened the door. She talked to Richard for a few minutes, making it clear to him that he's not her dad, and then left.<ref>[[Don't Let's Start]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith ended up in a bind with no one to watch her kids, so Maggie offered to watch them.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n\n\nIn the ER, Maggie treated a patient with what looked like Alzheimer's. While trying to get the patient stabilized, he accidentally hit Maggie on her cheek and eye, causing her to fall. Later, Richard asked Maggie if she was okay and Maggie responded that she was, but then said she thought she had a concussion. Maggie later complained about the patient to Richard Webber, who then revealed that her mother, Ellis Grey, had Alzheimer's.<ref>[[Don't Dream It's Over]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie finds out about Derek's death.]]Maggie was one of the first people to find out about Derek's death as she was present when Meredith returned to Grey Sloan to announce his death. She presumably attended Derek's funeral. Shortly after, Meredith disappeared with her kids without leaving other than a small note saying she and the kids were fine. Over the year that Meredith was gone, Maggie continued to bond with her colleagues, especially Alex and confessed to him that she felt abandoned by Meredith, now that they finally got to be somewhat of a family. They celebrated the holidays with other colleagues. She became a little closer to Richard when she invited him for Christmas, as he appeared to be a little lonely. She also defended him when Catherine stated he was too romantic for her. Maggie said that being romantic probably made him feel good about himself. When Meredith finally returned, she hung with Maggie and Alex while they informed her about the past year.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile Maggie and her colleagues were busy dealing with\ua[[Keith Gardner]]\uaafter a tunnel collapse, Maggie got a phone call from her mother, who informed her that her parents were getting a divorce. Maggie was emotional about this, but she didn't want to bother her colleagues about it.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Meredith bought her house back from Alex, she invited Maggie and Amelia to move in with her. They assisted Meredith in caring for her kids. Maggie also often mediated between Meredith and Amelia, who frequently got into fights over little things. She often helped with Meredith's three kids, with each \"sister\" in charge of getting one kid ready for the day.\n\n\nAfter a short conversation and a few drinks, Maggie ends up making out with Andrew and sleeps with him. After that night, Maggie and Andrew agree that it was a one-time thing only that day, but only to have sex again minutes after agreeing. Shortly after, Maggie and Andrew went public with their relationship. Andrew became uncomfortable with dating an attending and started avoiding Maggie. After she confronted him, they broke up.\n\n\nHer mother came to the hospital to visit Maggie and see Jackson to get rid of a rash, which turned out to be inflammatory breast cancer. Diane and Jackson were gonna tell Maggie before Diane left, but they got into a fight and never got to talk about the cancer. A few months later, when Diane returned to have surgery, Maggie kept thinking that her mother was getting breast implants and failed to understand why continuously trying to talk her mother out of it. When Diane later told Maggie the truth about her breast cancer, Maggie immediately started looking at her charts. Over the next few months, Maggie helped her mom through everything and stated her opinion about what she should do, which her mother followed. After Maggie butted heads with Meredith, Diane fired her from her mother's case. Maggie found a clinical trial and signed her mom up for it, although the trial did more harm than good.\n\nAfter she stated that she wasn't ready for her mom to go, Meredith told her to listen to her mom and record her voice in her mind. The next day, Maggie was talking to her mom and painting her nails. Diane gave her advice including to have some fun in her life and to be a little lazy or slutty and to make a mistake. When Maggie went to open a window, she came back to find that her mom had died. Later on, she was seen hugging her mom's lifeless body with Meredith and Amelia in the room. Her dad came in and she hugged him.\n\n\nMaggie bonded with Jackson after her mother's death. They frequently talked at work and they were together when the explosion caused a fire at the hospital. Jackson rushed off to go find Stephanie, which worried Maggie. She later confronted him about it in front of April, who later pointed out that she felt like Maggie liked Jackson and that he liked her back, which she recognized. Maggie was unsure how she felt about that as she hadn't thought about Jackson in that way until April suggested it.\n\nAwkwardness ensued in her talks with Jackson as she was constantly walking on eggshells in order not to give him signals. He picked up on her weird behavior and she later came clean about what had transpired between her and April. While initially brushing it off, it also made Jackson look at Maggie in another way. Both were in for a cold shower when Catherine, after a family dinner with Richard and Jackson that Maggie attended, referred to Maggie as Jackson's sister.\n\nEventually, they did start dating. Their relationship progressed, and Maggie became more integrated into Jackson's family. They soon exchanged 'I love you's' and, months later, decided to move in together. Maggie was able to help Jackson through Catherine's tumor surgery, as Maggie had been through a similar situation with her own mother's illness.\n\n\nMaggie decided to chase after Jackson. She eventually heard him responding to her calls right when [[Victoria Hughes]] arrived with her aid car. She instructed Maggie to wait out on the street while she helped Jackson out of his predicament with [[Mari Prishna]] and [[Jai Prishna]]. Maggie then got on the ambulance with Jai and Jackson. After they arrived at the hospital, Jai was taken into the ER. Maggie and Jackson sat in the rig in silence and eventually agreed to talk about their fight when their temper had settled. He approached her after a week to inform her that Mari and Jai were doing fine. She was happy about that, but she was still angry at him for abandoning her in the car in the woods, while he just thought of it as \"taking a walk.\" She decided she was still too angry to talk and left.\n\nA week later, she joined Jackson as he was trying to figure out why Jai had had an apparent stroke. He brought up Mari hanging onto him for hours, nearly losing her arm in the process, which led to him on life support after excruciating surgeries due to something being irreparably broken inside him. He was wondering if Mari should have let go back at that cliff. Maggie understood he was using them as a metaphor for their broken relationship and that he thought it was time to let go. She agreed. The break-up stuck as she wanted someone who didn't abandon her over and over again. While she thought they would go back to being friends, she found him pretty defensive when she inquired about him and Vic after she saw them together. He told her they were just friends, but added it was none of her business. She agreed, since they apparently didn't like each other enough to even be friends.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShe and Amelia went to collect some of Maggie's stuff from Jackson's penthouse. After Maggie told her she had to tell Link about her pregnancy, Amelia showed her Jackson had posted a photo on social media with #Freedom in the caption. Maggie hated how he was sending her a message through Instagram. In the hospital parking lot, a scooter crashed into her car. Maggie and Owen took [[Reid Kim]], the driver, to a trauma room. En route there, they ran into Jackson and she made a mean comment about his freedom now that he was dating a firefighter instead of an intellectually challenging woman. Meanwhile, Reid was diagnosed with a few broken ribs. They told him he was lucky and he told Maggie she was, too, since she ran into him. She denied as she was standing still when he crashed into her car, after which he deteriorated. It was discovered he had a cardiac tamponade. They relieved the tamponade and managed to resuscitate him after extensive efforts. He made it through surgery and Maggie briefed Reid's girlfriend Tara in the ICU. Tara openly wondered why she was staying with someone who treated her as terribly as Reid did. Maggie drew parallels from her relationship with Jackson and guessed that things were good in the beginning, but then she noticed some red flags, which she ignored because dating is hard, especially for successful women. She advised Tara to leave Reid before he left her because that could leave her feeling like a victim, which she thought was so much worse than ripping that Band-Aid off herself. Afterward, she ran into Jackson, who told her she was wrong about Vic. She apologized for her comment but pointed out he had been spiteful with his caption, even if he hadn't meant to be.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nThe break-up continued to be hard on her as she kept having dreams about Jackson with Victoria thrown in the mix, too. She hated how he walked out of the fog with a new girlfriend like she never existed. Amelia informed her she and Link were keeping the baby. Amelia had trouble with keeping the secret as it clashed with her rigorous honesty but Maggie told her that privacy and honesty weren't mutually exclusive. While her experiences with love had led her to believe love wasn't worth it due to all the heartbreak, loss, back-stabbing, and pettiness, witnessing the reunion between [[Bertram Hollister]] and [[Soyoung Oh]] showed her what true love looked like. On her way home, she ran into Vic, who told her she didn't want things to be awkward. Maggie admitted she felt Jackson had moved on a little too fast to her liking and proceeded to unsuccessfully assure Vic that things weren't awkward at all.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith's article was inadvertently turned into an attack on Grey Sloan, Bailey was worried that the stress of the article's fall-out was getting to her heart. Maggie did a full cardiac work-up, which revealed her heart was fine. Given her hot flashes and mood swings, Maggie suggested it might be hormonal and drew blood for a full panel. Meanwhile, Maggie, Teddy, and Link tried to save a patient who was hit by a stowaway whose frozen body had fallen out of a plane but they failed given the extensive injuries. After the surgery, she got Bailey's results and went to tell her that, while she was indeed perimenopausal as suspected, she was also pregnant.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref> After an extensive surgery made her feel more than she'd ever felt during her relationship with Jackson, Maggie found comfort in the realization that surgery was her truest love, which she thought might never change. She joined Meredith and Amelia while they were waiting for updates on Zola's shunt revision.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Maggie got the kids ready for school while Meredith was in jail for the hours of community service she had missed. After school, the kids came to the hospital but Zola refused to go to daycare because it was for little children. Since Maggie had surgery, she convinced Andrew to watch her and assured him it'd be easy with Zola just reading her book or sitting in the OR gallery. Maggie later took the kids trick-or-treating and helped them sort the candy afterward.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Catherine returned to Seattle after a long absence, she ran into Maggie and asked how things were going at the hospital. During their conversation, Maggie learned that Jackson hadn't told her about their breakup yet. She went to confront him about that but their bickering on the matter was interrupted by the arrival of [[Sabrina Webber]], whom Maggie noticed had an uncanny resemblance to her. Maggie approached her and heard they were looking for Richard. Maggie introduced herself to Sabrina and her father [[Chris Webber]] and learned they were her cousin\uaand uncle. They knew about Maggie, who offered to drive them to Pac-North to see Richard. En route, she learned Chris and Sabi knew a lot about her and Sabi addressed the uncanny resemblance between them, which she proved by taking a picture of the two of them together. Chris commented on her lack of knowledge about them was due to Richard's being ashamed of them, though Sabi disagreed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Maggie tries to convince Sabi that she is the best to operate on her.]]\nAt Pac-North, they met up with Richard, who hadn't seen his family in five years. Sabi declined a tour and showed Maggie and Richard a picture of the massive cardiac tumor she had been diagnosed with back home. Maggie did a quick exam and decided they needed scans to get an updated view of the tumor. They exchanged phone numbers while waiting for the scan and learned they had a lot in common, like their love for crossword puzzles. While Sabi was in the scanner, Richard told her he hadn't told her about his family because they believed he thought he was better than them and he wanted to protect her from that. The scans then revealed the tumor had grown considerably and infiltrated its surrounding tissues.\n\nMaggie presented Sabi and Chris with the facts and offered to operate today but Sabi had reservations about being operated on by her family. Maggie stated she was the best and she wasn't sure the family rule applied since they had only known each other for two hours. Chris then pointed out she just steamrolled all of Sabi's concerns without listening, which he thought she inherited from Richard. Maggie disagreed and said her concerns were just not valid. Richard didn't have her back and said he'd page the on-call cardio surgeon. Maggie was upset with him for that and he explained this experience could lead to her growing closer with Sabi, which could all be jeopardized if something went wrong in that OR. Maggie pointed out Sabi came here for help from a doctor and she thought it was a shame Richard couldn't think like one. However, she did agree to consult with the cardio surgeon. However, while Maggie was out getting coffee, Sabi started crashing. Maggie rushed back to the room. Since the surgery was now urgent, Richard convinced Chris to consent to letting Maggie operate. The surgery went well until Sabi started clotting. The perfusionist hadn't informed her that Sabi's clotting time had stopped rising, as Pac-North's protocol was for the surgeon to ask, despite being given multiple doses of heparin. Maggie then realized Sabi was heparin-resistant. Maggie rushed to replace the bypass. Alex found her working frantically to save Sabi's life and concluded it was too late; Sabi was already brain dead. She stepped back and Alex called time of death. While on her way to talk to Chris and Richard, she saw a text from Richard and the picture of her and Sabi. She started to break down and Alex took her into a supply closet so she could get it all out. She composed herself and then informed Sabi's family. Chris yelled at her for operating on Sabi against Sabi's wishes, after which he stormed off. Richard and Catherine left to take Chris to go say goodbye to Sabi, leaving a broken down Maggie behind.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie accompanied Meredith, Andrew, Alex, and Amelia to a hotel for Meredith's hearing before the medical board, though she retreated to the hotel bar rather than attend the hearing. She got drunk and started explaining how Sabi died to a bartender. Jackson found her in the bar. He had heard about Sabi's death from his mother. Maggie told him she was afraid Richard would never speak to him again, which she couldn't blame him for. Jackson decided to take her home she could continue drinking there. At the house, Jackson told her he suspected Richard and Catherine were having issues but she didn't know anything about that. They then received word that Meredith got to keep her license. She realized she hadn't helped at all though he pointed out a drunk testimony wouldn't have helped. They laughed and he confessed he had missed talking to her about their lives. They nearly kissed until he backed off, saying he couldn't do it. Maggie then threw him out at the exact moment Meredith came home. Meredith asked what happened and Maggie replied she hated someone she used to love.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie and Meredith returned to work on the same day. Her first case back was [[Elliott Calhoun]], who needed an aortic valve replacement. Maggie was surprised to learn Elliott's wife [[Finley Calhoun|Finley]] had given birth to their son prematurely, adding to the pressure of the case. Maggie asked Teddy to scrub in with her. While Teddy wondered why Maggie needed help on such an easy procedure, she gladly accepted to operate on non-traumatized hearts again. During the surgery, Maggie continuously asked about the activated clotting time. Teddy brought up Owen had offered her to come run Cardio at Pac-North but Maggie scolded her for chit-chatting. Shortly before the procedure was done, Tom complimented Teddy's technique from the gallery. Maggie wondered why Teddy wasn't telling him he didn't have a future with her. Teddy was then paged away to the ER, leaving Maggie to take Elliott off bypass by herself. She did so but the heart didn't restart, causing her to panic. Teddy was brought back in and she found Maggie pondering what she did wrong. Teddy suggested they were faced with hibernating myocardium given the fact that Elliott had been on bypass multiple times. Teddy recommended they keep Elliott in the OR for a few hours as his heart would most likely restart. Since Maggie wasn't feeling like telling his family that he had died, she agreed. Maggie went to inform Finley, who didn't quite understand. Maggie couldn't handle it and left. She ran into Tom and resigned. He tried to convince her not to but she said she had lost faith in her abilities and couldn't do her job without that. After watching Elliott from the gallery, Maggie went home.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie spent her day sleeping on the couch. Andrew came by after work to inform her that Elliott's heart had indeed restarted. Maggie was relieved to hear that and Andrew asked her for advice on his problem with Meredith. Maggie pointed out he had hurt a woman who had been hurt more than enough for a lifetime. Her short-lived happiness was cut short when a woman dropped by to serve her with a lawsuit. She found out Chris was suing her for Sabrina's wrongful death.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie continued to shut everyone out. Eventually, Richard came by the house. He wanted to take her out to eat but seeing her made him realize it was better for them to eat in. While looking for things he could cook for her, Maggie told him she didn't deserve compassion from him. Richard disagreed and offered to let her talk to Pac-North's new psychologist, which led her to freak out. She realized she was being awful and requested to be left alone. Richard ignored her and said they'd start with coffee. Over coffee, he asked her why she quit since she was Sabi's only shot. He explained he couldn't look at her after Sabi's death not because of what she did but because of what he had done to her. He had sent her in there knowing Sabi was unlikely to survive. Maggie told him Sabi had died because she forgot to ask about the clotting time, which made her think she didn't belong in the OR. She asked him to leave. He left but much to her surprise, he returned soon after with food. He started to make pancakes for her and she begged him to yell at her, knowing he had lost more than she had. Richard told her about one of the few lessons his mother taught him before her death: talking problems out over pancakes. Over pancakes, Richard admitted had wondered about what he could have done differently. Maggie took all the blame but Richard says being imperfect meant she was human. She admitted no one had ever had to tell her that before. He advised her to let her insurance settle with Chris so he would get the sense that something came from Sabi's death. Richard told her quitting now meant quitting on all the lives only she could save, which he knew Sabi wouldn't want. Maggie wished she had known Sabi better. Richard offered to let her ask all the questions about Sabi she wanted since he felt like talking about his niece.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\n\nMaggie is open-hearted, optimistic and she believes in everybody and wants them to be their best.\uaShe describes herself as a big control freak, resulting in a great professional drive and her being unable to leave things unfinished. She is also described as perky and chatty, often putting her in awkward situations when she's not up to date on other people's personal life.\n\n\n\nDean\nShe was dating a man named Dean who loved to cuddle. But since she can't sleep with someone lying next to her, she would sneak out after he fell asleep and spend the night on the couch before returning in the morning before he woke up. He eventually proposed and she explained the sleeping to him, telling him he could sleep in a room down the hall. He didn't want a woman who didn't sleep in the same room as him. He is now married to a woman who loves cuddling.<ref>[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ethan Boyd]]\nShe also dated a radiologist named Ethan shortly after arriving at Grey Sloan Memorial. He pursued her with compliments, but Maggie played hard to get. They were hot and heavy for six months until she got bored and let it fizzle out.\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nMaggie ends up making out and sleeping with intern [[Andrew DeLuca]] after a short conversation and a couple of drinks at Joe's.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie freaks out the next day, and in an office in the hospital, they have a conversation about last night and agree it was a one-time thing. They shake on it before they once again start kissing and proceed to undress.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after they went public, Andrew became uncomfortable with the way things changed when people knew he was seeing an attending and he started to avoid her. When she confronted him, he broke up with Maggie.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nMaggie had a crush on Nathan, and later she asked him out, but on Meredith's request, he declined.\n\n[[Clive Johnson]]\nMaggie matched with Clive on Tinder. They set up a date that\uaMaggie forgot about. Clive showed up at her work to pick her up.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\uaThey kept going on dates, one of which she left early because she forgot about her dancing class with Richard.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith and Amelia wanted to meet Clive, so Maggie decided to host a game night. Clive's wife showed up. Maggie was devastated that she was seeing a married guy. This caused\uathem to break up.\uaJackson told Clive to forget Maggie's address and to never call her again.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nAfter Maggie broke up with Clive, Jackson came by the house after he himself broke up with his new girlfriend Priya. He then confessed he had been thinking about Maggie every time instead of Priya. He knew Maggie found their situation too complicated, but he professed his affection for her anyway. They then ended up kissing.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nJackson asked Maggie out, but she denied,\uasaying\uashe needed to focus on her surgery. Later, she paged Jackson for a consult, though he\uawas hoping it was about the dinner. After work, Maggie saw Jackson at the bar. She wanted to leave but decided to stay. They talked and Jackson asked her out to dinner again and she agreed.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Maggie and Jackson were making out in the closet, they decided to have dinner at his place instead. As they opened the door sharing one last kiss, Richard and Catherine were both staring at them. Maggie awkwardly walked away and Jackson closed the door in embarrassment. Maggie told Meredith that she felt like a teenager. Jackson fixed things with his mother and Richard and Maggie was glad that they weren't an obstacle in\uatheir relationship.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen April was having her crisis of faith, she kissed Jackson. Maggie found out about this and was upset\uathat Jackson didn't tell her.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref> She wanted Jackson to apologize but he didn't know what he did wrong. Later, she showed up at Jackson's house and they made up and had sex.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nWhen they both received invitations for Jo's and Alex's wedding, they decided to go together as a couple.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and Maggie broke up shortly after they went camping.\n\n[[Winston Ndugu]]\nWinston was one of her residents at [[Tufts Medical Center|Tufts]]. She felt elated around him except when they were in the OR. He also had a crush on her but was too nervous to admit it because she was younger than him, but his chief resident. He was going to ask her out when he became an attending but she moved to Seattle. They met at a conference in California and instantly hit it off. They got to know each other in the short time they had. When the conference was over, he came up to Maggie and proposed either him moving to Seattle or her moving to Boston. Maggie told him she was the kind of person who needed time to make big decisions like that, and he told her to take the time she needed.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> When the Covid- pandemic started, Winston and Maggie would talk over the phone until Winston moved to Seattle to be with Maggie. Winston was granted permission to operate at Grey Sloan, but he still had a job at Tufts Medical Center. Maggie told him she was willing to move back to Boston to be with him, but he said they both knew she wouldn't. Later that same day, Winston proposed and Maggie said yes.  \n\nParents\nShe describes her parents as good, funny, kind, and goofy. She says her parents don't understand what she does or why she likes doing it. About two years after she started working at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], her mother confessed to her that she'd been having an affair with their car serviceman for eleven years and they had only stayed together for her sake, but were getting a divorce now that she was out on her own.\ua\n\nGrandparents\nAll her grandparents are still living.\n\nShe has a grandmother who refers to her vagina as \"lady place\" and is not shy about talking about it.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\nMaggie never met her birth mother, but  years prior to joining the\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] staff, she looked for her birth mother and found out that she was dead, but got her name. After learning that Maggie is her half-sister, Meredith gave Maggie Ellis' journals, so Maggie could get an idea of what Ellis was like.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nMaggie met her birth father unknowingly when she arrived at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Maggie quickly bonded with Webber while they worked together. She admired his skill greatly. When he eventually tried to tell her that he's her biological father, she became upset with him for having not told her right away.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMaggie and her maternal half-sister Meredith didn't get along at first because Meredith thought she had come to Seattle looking for money or to profit from Ellis's reputation. They fought over little things and about patients. Derek planned a family dinner for himself, Meredith, Maggie, and Richard to smooth things over but he and Meredith ended up having sex in the shower and missing the dinner, hurting Maggie's feelings.<ref>[[Don't Let's Start]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith confronted her about it, she told Meredith that the reason she was sad about the dinner being canceled was that she was excited to talk to people and eat food that wasn't from a packet and socialize. Meredith then invited Maggie to Ellis's old house to socialize with Callie and Alex.<ref>[[Could We Start Again, Please?]], x</ref> \n\nOver time, Maggie and Meredith grew closer and now they have a good  relationship.\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAlthough having no legal or blood relation to Amelia, Maggie considers herself Amelia's sister (through Meredith). Amelia reciprocates this as Amelia was comfortable enough to speak to Maggie about race. Despite appreciating Amelia's sincerity, she advised Amelia to check her white privilege and to not treat her as the spokeswoman for all black people.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Amelia shut\uaLink out, Maggie tried to bring her breakfast, but Amelia refused, saying she wanted to be alone. She reminded Maggie of the space they'd given her after Sabi, and Maggie reluctantly agreed. However, she came back, saying that she was an only child and therefore needed independent space to solve her problems, but Amelia grew up in a wolf pack, and wolves only go off on their own to die. She sat down by Amelia and listened to her talk about her worries about Link and the baby. Later that night, when Link tried to visit Amelia, Maggie lied for Amelia until Amelia came downstairs herself.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nCristina and Maggie first met when Cristina interviewed Maggie for the head of cardio position at GSM. Despite feeling that Maggie was very young to do the job, she told Owen that she was qualified to do it.\n\nOnce she was officially hired, Maggie became frustrated because Cristina didn't respect her as her new boss. On Cristina's last day, she scheduled a pediatric heart transplant (for [[Lincoln McNeil|Link McNeil]]) amidst the chaos of the explosion at the mall, much to Maggie's confusion and frustration. Cristina even treated her as a resident by not listening to her objections and practically forcing her to prepare Link for the surgery. Maggie ultimately did the transplant herself as Cristina had to leave to catch her flight.\n\n\nPierce is the current [[Attending#Department Head|Co-Head]] of [[Cardiothoracic Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] with [[Teddy Altman]].\n\nShe finished high school, college, and [[Medical School|med school]] early. After med school, she began and subsequently completed a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Tufts Medical Center]]. At twenty-five, she began her [[Fellow|cardiothoracic surgery fellowship]]. Some time after, she was promoted to head the cardiothoracic surgical department.\n\nTwo years later, Pierce applied for the Head of Cardio position at Grey Sloan Memorial and succeeded [[Jeff Russell]] as the new department head. Despite having submitted her notice of resignation very early in her tenure for personal reasons, she was convinced to remain at her post by [[Derek Shepherd]].\n\nShe quit her job when losing [[Sabrina Webber]] caused her to lose faith in her own abilities, which she deemed necessary for her job. She was then made an offer by [[Richard Webber]] to come run the Cardio department at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]]. She accepted the offer but the hospital was purchased by the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]] and closed down on her first day. Like all other staff, she had to interview for a job at Grey Sloan with [[Tom Koracick]] and ended up hired as Co-Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, sharing the job with Teddy, who had been hired to replace Maggie after she quit.\n\n\n*Maggie finished high school and medical school early.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n*The writers stated they knew about Maggie's existence since the very beginning and wanted to introduce the character ever since season , but chose to introduce Thatcher's other children first; afterward, it never felt like the right time until Cristina left, creating a hole in Meredith's life. This also led Shonda to claim that there have been indirect references to Maggie over the course of the series. This is especially evident in [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season ]] as [[Only Mama Knows]] features numerous flashbacks from that season.\n*According to her mother, she started reading at the age of two.\n*There's nothing Maggie doesn't eat.\n*Growing up, Maggie was bullied because she was younger and smaller than the other kids, and because of her lisp.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n*On Twitter, Shonda Rhimes revealed she thought a lot about making Ellis and Richard's love child a son.

My childhood home is sold. My mother is in Hawaii making soups now. I\uI have no home.

When he was informed of that, he mentioned the rash on Marion's wrist, which she was scratching. An examination revealed a worm under her skin, which [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] believed to be the cause of Jake's problems. They contracted the worm when they ate sushi from a train station while in Thailand.\n\nThey put Jake on anti-parasitics and waited for the worm to die. Scans showed no further damage, but he was unsettled not knowing where the worm was. Then his legs went numb and he lost feeling in his arms and legs.

She was previously an [[attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] before switching specialties. Following her [[Paul Stadler|estranged husband]]'s death, she married [[Alex Karev]] until he left her for his ex-wife, [[Izzie_Stevens|Izzie]]. She is now the mother of [[Luna Ashton]].  \n\n\n\nAt only five days old, Jo Wilson was left by her [[Vicki Ann Rudin|mother]] at a fire station. She was shuffled among numerous foster homes until age  when she began living independently out of her car. Her teacher, Ms. Schmidt, would let her into the school building early to use the school showers and to do laundry. Jo worked furiously to get through school, graduating as high school valedictorian and moving on to Princeton University, where she graduated cum laude. Wilson then attended [[Harvard Medical School]], where she graduated at the top of her class. Wilson confessed to [[Alex Karev]] that Ms. Schmidt was the only person who supported her and thus the only one at her graduation.\n\n\nDuring a conversation with [[Andrew DeLuca]], Jo revealed that she is married. She said, \"when I bought something wrong, he'd hit me in my face, or my stomach...\" Being done with his abusive behavior, Jo fled to somewhere he'd never find her: Seattle. She claimed that if she tried to divorce him, he would find her. Jo kept her past confidential until after Alex proposed when she drunkenly confesses to Andrew that, that was the reason. She also admitted that 'Jo Wilson' isn't her real name. Her real name was 'Brooke Stadler'.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\n\nJo started her internship at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] shortly after the [[Flight|plane crash]]. She quickly learned, along with the other interns, to fear [[Meredith Grey]], dubbing her Medusa. Meredith was put in charge of choosing an intern for the intern appy and she chose Jo. As the other interns gathered in the gallery and unknowingly insulted Meredith with the intercom on, Jo started the surgery under Meredith's supervision. Jo successfully took out the appendix but ripped the cecum afterward. As Meredith pressed her to think and act, Jo froze as expected. Meredith had to finish the surgery. After the surgery, Owen found Jo crying in the hallway. He told her to cry elsewhere and informed her that the intern appy is designed for the intern to fail to set an example for the others. Jo then asked him why Meredith was so mean, bringing up the plane crash she had heard about. Owen told her that Meredith wasn't mean but strong and that she was so hard on Jo in order to teach her the way she deserved to be taught.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she wanted to scrub in on a surgery, she flirted with Callie to try to make it happen. However, Callie pointed out that Jo looked terrified that Callie might take her up on that offer, meaning she probably isn't into ladies. Callie told her not to trade sex for scrubbing in because that's skanky, to save it for actually getting to cut. Then she sent her to go suck up to Alex instead. He said no and when he saw her watching from the gallery, he sent her away. Later, when he scolded her for charting when she hadn't scheduled a consult for him, she began to cry, freaking him out. He invited her to scrub in on a surgery with him.<ref>[[Love the One You're With]], x</ref>\n\nAfter dealing with the case of [[Kimmy|Kimmy's]] son, Jo revealed to Alex what her childhood had been like.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n\nWhen given an opportunity to do something none of the other interns had done yet, Jo jumped at the chance. However, when she froze in the OR, she went to [[Arizona Robbins]] and told her what had happened, saying she believed Alex set her up to fail. Alex later came to her and told her that he was trying to let her do something cool, but she freaked out. She said she was paranoid because her life has taught her that she can't trust anyone, but he informed her that she needs to get over it.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nAt Bailey's wedding, she had a drink, so when the doctors were called back to the hospital after a motorcycle crash, she was unable to go with them. Instead, she continued to drink with Alex. They got drunk and broke into a hotel room, where they raided a mini-bar.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she heard about the plan to sell the hospital for parts, she admitted to Alex that she was sad and didn't want not to see him anymore, because she liked that he would talk to kids about pulling tiny little men out of their bellies.<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\n\nJo and the other interns started referring to Jason as \"Chest Peckwell.\" Alex took an immediate distaste to him, even going so far as to gang up with a patient and Dr. Webber to prank him, to which Jason responded with a snide comment about \"nailing Jo in the bathroom.\"<ref>[[Idle Hands]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she told [[Alex Karev]] that she was planning to move in with Jason, he was initially very angry with her. However, after working with Jason on a case, he told Jason that he was just protective of Jo because he had been in a similar situation to Jo as a child, though he never had it quite as bad as she did. He was unaware that Jo had not told Jason any of this. When Jo found out that Jason knew, she became angry with Alex for telling him.<ref>[[Sleeping Monster]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a heated fight which involved Jason hitting Jo, she fled to Alex's house. He settled her into his bed. When Alex showed up at the hospital with Jason, who had been severely beaten, Meredith and Cristina assumed that Alex had done it, but it turned out that Jo herself had done it. When he grabbed her arm, she fought him off and he fell back and hit his head on the fireplace. She claimed he was fine when she left and still yelling.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the superstorm, Jo helped to bag the babies in the NICU and then later to teach the parents how to bag their own babies. Arizona told Alex that Jo was great that day and if he's going to take credit for making his ladies crazy, he should take credit for helping make them great. Alex found Jo later and confessed his love. They shared a kiss.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Jo and Alex at the gala]]\nAfter their first kiss, Alex and Jo went to an [[On-Call Room|on-call room]] to make out. Alex wanted to wait to do it at his house, but Jo reminded him that there was a tree in his house and removed her scrub top. They continued kissing until Jo asked them if he had sex with Heather and Leah in that particular room. He confirmed, but Jo decided she could move past this and they continued kissing. He got paged, and she asked him to ignore the page. This made her think about dead people so they gave up. They went to the ER to help out treating the storm victims, which was impeded by the fact that they were all low on supplies and that the electric charts were still down. Meanwhile, she and the other interns also waited for news on Heather, who was being operated on. In a supply closet, Jo talked to Alex about her fear that Heather would die, only ending up to start kissing him again. However, it turned out Alex also had had sex with other interns in that closet, so Jo decided it wasn't going to happen there and left.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the mourning interns, who got the night off, decided they would all wait together for [[Maura Brooks|Heather's mother]] to arrive, as none of them wanted to do it on their own. They started looking for kind Heather stories to tell Maura and decided to look for Derek to hear about her talent for neurosurgery, but Meredith told them the mother wouldn't care about that and told them the story that she told George's mother back when he had died. Jo then met Alex in a lounge and told him that she and the others apparently weren't a tight group. They joked a little about the future of their relationship and he gave her a bottle of liquor that would help her and the others to come up with stories. Jo went to her fellow interns in the dressing room, where they started drinking. They realized that they knew nothing about each other, despite all the time they spent together. They decided to play circle of trust, during which Jo revealed to have been a street kid. Not long after, Maura Brooks arrived, and they stole Meredith's story. They then sat with her until Derek arrived to tell her what happened to Heather. Early in the morning, Derek met with the interns in the ER waiting room and thanked them for having stayed with Maura. He told them to go home, but Shane decided to ride out with the firefighters to the mudslide instead. Jo, Stephanie and Leah declared him crazy, but suddenly Stephanie stood up too and gave a speech that made it clear to Leah and Jo that they should stick together. Jo and Leah then got up too, and followed Stephanie and Shane to the ambulance bay to ride out to the mudslide with the firefighters.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the interns began all sleeping at Alex's house and studying. Jo was waiting for Alex to proposition her so they could have sex and Alex was waiting because he thought she was still grieving, so he said they could stay there as long as they wanted. Jo went to the others and said that they needed to leave. That night, Jo went to Alex's house to wait for him. He came home and she said she was not an unfeeling person, but she wanted to have sex. He picked her up and carried her upstairs.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\n\nAt the fundraising gala, Jo spoke to donors on Alex's behalf, but pressured him to talk to them himself. When Alex left to go back to the hospital, Jo was upset. She went back to the hospital and found him drawing blood from himself. She believed he was doing drugs, but he corrected that he believed his father was in the hospital, so he was drawing blood to check. When the results came in, Alex decided he didn't want to know just before Jo told him that it was his father.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the time came for Alex's father to be discharged, Jo got him set up for  days in a rehab facility. He declined and left the hospital.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex didn't come home for several nights, Jo was concerned that he was seeing someone else, but she figured out that it was about Alex's dad.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nJimmy later returned in withdrawal. Jo treated him over Alex's objections.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref> After speaking to Jimmy and telling him that Jimmy leaving when he was a kid was better for all of them, Alex went to the wedding and told Jo that they were all they needed and that they'd be together forever. She agreed, but didn't realize that he meant it as a marriage proposal.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref> When Jimmy's wife came to the hospital after Alex lied to her and said that Jimmy was dead, Alex introduced Jo as his fianc\uee, confusing her. She confronted him about it, saying she wasn't leaving him, but she wasn't ready for marriage.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Callie was sued by [[Travis Reed]] for malpractice, which led to the amputation of both of his legs, Jo testified on her behalf as she had scrubbed in on the surgery.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\n\nJo was upset to hear about the non-fraternization policy. She said that since they spend so much time at the hospital, they don't have time to meet anyone else. When she found out that one of the residents had filed the claim that led to the policy, she immediately assumed that Stephanie had filed it and was cold toward her. She later went to Stephanie when she found out that April and Jackson were still together. She said that Stephanie filing the claim was ruining her life, but Leah confessed that she filed the claim and explained why she did it.\n\nJo and Alex staged a fake fight and breakup so that people wouldn't think they were together. They started to sneak around the hospital, but after a rendezvous in a supply room, which Richard discovered, they were called into a meeting with the board. Alex came in and called them hypocrites before leaving.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Alex was suspended for violating the policy, Meredith began to look into options for them. She got them a love contract and said if they signed it, HR said it was okay if they continued to date. Alex was worried about Jo leaving him if he asked her to sign the contract.<ref>[[Throwing it All Away]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex presented Jo with the contract, she told him she wouldn't sign it. Alex later assured her that the contract wasn't a commitment and that she wouldn't count on him, but said that he wanted to kiss her whenever he wants to kiss her and the contract would allow him to do that.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of whom had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAt Richard's birthday party, Owen asked him to be director of the residency program because he noticed how well he'd been mentoring the residents.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nDerek warned that he wasn't teaching enough, took all the residents to work on a case with him that he had rescheduled several times. As the OR wasn't available until  AM, he then took them to the ER to work on the incoming patients, including having them work on a patient who was already dead so they could work with real brain tissue. When a man came in with scissors puncturing his forehead, they took him into an OR for a controlled extraction. Jo extracted the scissors after Leah was unable to pull hard enough. Then they went back to the case of [[Nova Jenkins]]. Each of the residents took a turn to step up to the microscope and ask a question so they could learn.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Jo was on scut, she was working on several cases at once. She found that she couldn't handle working on so many cases at once, as it put patients at risk. After a day of that, Jo overheard Owen and Richard talk about one of the residents not being cut out for surgery. Jo believed it was her.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a patient with tetanus had a spasm that snapped his arm, Jo was concerned that she had broken the patient's bone. She worked on the case with Callie. While working on the case, she discovered that she has a knack for ortho.<ref>[[You Be Illin']], x</ref>\n\nJo was used for testing the emotion-reading machine Callie and Derek had gotten for their trial. She didn't have a positive response to the expected stimuli, but when Callie mentioned an ortho injury that came into the ER, Jo lit up.<ref>[[I'm Winning]], x</ref> Jo continued to work with Callie on ortho cases and loved it.<ref>[[Change of Heart]], x</ref> She worked with Callie on an ortho case after hearing that one of the residents was about to be fired. In an attempt not to get fired, she continued to suck up to the attendings. Callie noticed this and said that she needed to have grit if she planned to continue working on ortho.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\nYears later, Paul was able to find Jo in Seattle and he confronted her.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> While they talked, he explained to her that he and his fiancee, [[Jenny (Season )|Jenny]], wanted to get married but they couldn't since he and Jo were still married. They later signed the divorce papers.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Paul was distracted by Arizona, Jo was able to find Jenny and warned her of Paul's abusive tendencies. Jenny said that they were happy and denied any abuse, but Jo gave Jenny her card with her cell number on it in case she needed help. While Jo was in the resident's lounge, Paul came to her and said that Jenny told her what Jo had said and gave Paul Jo's card. He told her that he decided to keep it for himself.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Paul became the victim of a hit-and-run, Jenny assumed that it was Jo who did it and thanked her for it. Jo later went with Jenny to confront Paul and vowed to tell the police about how he abused her. This angered Paul and he and tried to attack her, but hit his head and caused second-impact syndrome, causing his brain to swell and leaving him brain dead. Since Jo was still legally his wife, she was tasked with making his end-of-life decisions, which she used to donate his organs.<ref>[[Personal Jesus]], x</ref>\n\n\nThe day after their wedding, Alex and Jo travelled to Los Angeles for their honeymoon. They settled on the beach and Jo brought up an article she had read about killer cancer cells. It felt new to her, while Boston already felt old. As he said he wouldn't mind their kids growing up in Boston, she had a thought and ran off. She went to a beach bar and started writing down ideas on napkins. He came to apologize for talking about kids, but she told him to shut up so she could focus as it was not about the kids thing. She returned to their vacation apartment to work on her idea. When Alex returned from a day of fun around town, she presented him with her idea: introducing suicide genes in cancer cell DNA to design cancer killer cells. She apologized for ruining their honeymoon, but he was just delighted that she agreed to marry him. He fed her some food and commented that their kids would be really smart.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nJo and Alex returned to Seattle early and they presented Meredith with Jo's idea. Meredith hated that she came to wave the future of medicine in her face before leaving for Boston, but Jo said she actually wanted Meredith to create a fellowship for her that would allow her to work on the mini livers and her own projects. Meredith loved the idea and took it to Bailey. Meanwhile, Jo cancelled Boston. However, Meredith came back with bad news: there was no money to fund the fellowship. Jo and Alex then went to Joe's for day drinking. Alex suggested she call Boston back, but she had come to realize she only applied there because she could, but it felt like going backwards. Empowered by the alcohol, Jo and Alex went back to Bailey's office and Jo pitched why she was the future of medicine. Bailey then decided to create the fellowship and fund it with her own money as she was in need of some joy. Afterwards, Jo returned to the bar and bragged to the interns about her new fellowship.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Now going by Dr. Jo Karev, Jo tries to get started on the fellowship.]]\nJo's first day in navy scrubs coincided with Alex's first day as interim Chief. They enjoyed the Chief parking space and headed in. Jo felt like people were staring at them. She gave Alex a gift to celebrate his promotion and went to work. Bailey had trouble letting go of her job while Jo wanted to get to work on the fellowship. Bailey had Jo operate with her and then headed out to take care of stuff. Jo went to complain to Meredith that she'd rather work with her, but Meredith advised her to just tell Bailey what she needed. Jo later found her in the Chief's office, thinking she was going over the research she had sent her, but Bailey actually discovered that Alex had spent the entire quarter's budget in a day. Jo then left them to talk.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhile in bed together and making out, Jo asked Alex for a new INUMAC MRI. He felt like she was taking advantage and left for work. She later set the record straight in a hallway, stating she just wanted orgasms from him, which was overheard by Richard. He later found her to go home together and apologized for calling her a hooker. They then came across [[Atticus Lincoln]], whom Jo enthusiastically greeted and who called her Brooke. Alex stood there confused while the two reconciled.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nJo took care of Alex's voting ballot. She and Link caught up on the years they missed of each other's lives. Jo explained to Richard that she and Link went all the way back to undergrad when they waited tables together, adding that they were like brother and sister, so nothing romantic ever happened. Jo then went to her lab and found that Bailey had written whiteboards full of different approaches to Jo's cancer killer cells idea. Since it was too much for one year, they needed to narrow it down. Both were then called in for a consult by Alex for [[Nina Sullivan]], whom had a mysterious cause of abdominal pain. Jo and Bailey managed to figure it out. Later, Bailey confided in Jo that she had removed all stressors at work from her life, but she was still stressed. While Bailey was thinking that Ben was the cause of it all, Jo assured her that the two of them were good together. She then went by Alex's office. She heard he had worked with Link and he told her he was a great guy. They started to make out in his chair.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nJo assisted Alex at work to make him less grumpy all the time. She then got the idea to set up Link with Meredith, assuring Link that she was worth the effort to get her to open up. When a donor liver for their patient was redirected, Jo and Bailey came up with the idea to revive a liver from a deceased patient using a perfusion system. Alex ordered them to shut it down as to not risk their standing with UNOS. She met up with Link, who had been turned down by Meredith. Jo told him she did that to her, too, but she came around. Bailey then paged her, having decided to go behind Alex's back. They pulled off the transplant successfully. While Alex was angry at first, he admitted to getting turned on by Jo's genius and they made out in his office, closing the blinds when [[Frankie Shavelson|Nurse Frankie]] saw them. That night, Jo invited Link to the loft so she could properly cut his hair after he had cut off a piece to comfort a cancer patient. Meredith came over, too, needing some company. As she took over from Jo, Jo and Alex agreed that Meredith and Link did look nice together.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nAlex and Jo overslept on the day of the massive windstorm. By the time they got up, it was too dangerous to go outside, so they decided to stay in and have a second honeymoon. When the electricity died, she wound up finding Bubbe, a Bunsen burner she had used to cook meat on while she was living in her car. She also found their marriage certificate. Since neither had mailed it in, their marriage wasn't official. They later went through all their wedding presents that April had registered for and found they didn't need any of them, so they agreed to return them and buy a bigger TV with the money they'd get back. They made out and drank beer out of fancy glasses. They enjoyed the married life and agreed to mail in the certificate.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref> As soon as the bridge re-opened, Alex felt pressured as Chief to go to the hospital. She agreed he should go and stayed behind herself.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nJo, Meredith, and Link ended up working on [[Natasha Deon|Natashe Deon's]] case together while Meredith and Link grew more and more frustrated with one another. Jo defended her trying to set them up by explaining to Meredith that Link was the greatest guy she ever met before Alex, like Meredith had been for Alex. She assured her that he was a great guy once you got to know him. During surgery, Meredith questioned how Link could be a doctor despite his laid-back attitude. Jo says his cancer inspired him to become a doctor, but Link shut her down as it was not her story to tell. Natasha had to be put in a medically-induced coma to let her heal while her fianc\ue sat by her side. Jo went to tell Alex she was glad they were alive and that they got married. Later, she came across Amelia and Tom arguing over a way to visualize Catherine's tumor and showed them to a brand-new type of microscope that would help them.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jo finds that Meredith is in a love triangle with Link and Andrew.]]\nWith the holidays approaching, Jo invited Meredith to her and Alex's navy blue scrubs-only NYE party and suggested she bring Link as a plus one. Instead, Meredith invited Andrew. Jo was upset, but Meredith stated she could handle her own love life. Jo then mocked her for being in a love triangle. Over the course of the holidays, the doctors continued to work on Natasha, whose status kept declining to the point where death was imminent. Alex had an idea to give her her wedding under the stars. He and Jo gathered all the doctors and nurses in Natasha's room and they held up their phones with images of stars on the display while Meredith officiated the wedding.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nJo found out that Meredith had stood up Link on Valentine's Day and vented some anger, but Meredith had already apologized to him by then. When a display with all Chiefs of Surgery from the past and present was installed in the cafeteria, Jo made Alex pose with his picture and sent a picture of him to his mother to show her how far he had come. She assisted Maggie and Meredith whilst operating on [[Kimberly Thompson]]. Afterwards, she found that someone had switched Alex's and Bailey's pictures in the cafeteria, so Jo switched them back.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nJo watched Meredith's record-breaking surgery for longest surgery at the hospital for a while until she got paged to the ER when it was flooded with victims of a mass overdose at the park. She took care of a mother who claimed to have lost her playing son in the chaos at the park, but they later found out that she was a junkie herself who had taken her son with her to get a fix. Jo witnessed how Alex pressed the father to protect his son no matter what, even if it meant keeping him away from his mother, and she realized he himself had been through something similar with his father. She brought him hot chocolate in his office to comfort him and he told her about his experience of being left in a parking lot when he was .<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Jo was finishing up things at the hospital before leaving for Catherine's party at Jackson's place, she ran into [[Helen Karev]] at the hospital and found out that Alex supposedly had \"another doctor\" tell her to meet him at the party. Jo then offered her a ride and tried to call Alex, but he didn't answer. She found out Helen had travelled to Seattle through public transportation after getting inspired by the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex and Jo watch over Helen at the party.]]\nOnce they arrived, she started googling symptoms of a psychotic break, thinking the other doctor was in Helen's head, and made Jackson fetch Alex. While Jo and Alex discussed the possibility of Helen having a break, she disappeared amongst the other guests. They found her soon and tried to reach her doctor but were unable to get a hold of him due to the time difference. They decided to watch her for the night and find out more in the morning. Jo and the other guests evacuated when a supposed fire broke out. Outside, Jo stood by as Alex introduced his mother to Meredith, after which they took Helen home with them to the loft. They got her settled on the couch and watched her from the bed.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nJo and Alex took Helen to the hospital for a tour and Jo discovered she had knitted baby hats in an array of colors. Alex admitted he had told his mother that they wanted kids. Taken aback, Jo claimed she had a surgery and left. She then got herself on Jackson and Link's rotationplasty. During the surgery, Jo talked about having Helen over and how nice she was as a guest, except that she and Alex were now planning their babies. Jackson then asked her if she did not want kids like Alex. She said she did, but \"some day\" started to sound an awful lot like \"today.\" Jackson talked about Harriet and Jo asked if all the cute stuff outweighs the terror, like always worrying about them and bad things happening to them. Jackson was offended so she apologized to him after surgery. He told her kids can be monsters, but at the same time, they give you the feeling that everything's right. He said kids can ruin you, but they can also give you a reason to live when life tries to ruin you. She then visited Alex's office and told him that she was terrified of passing on her genes because she didn't know anything about her biological family's medical history. While she had learned to live with it, she didn't want that for their kids, which is why she decided to have her genome screened.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she got her test results back, she asked Maggie to open them with her. She turned out not to be the carrier of any major genetic diseases and the test also revealed the name of a probable first cousin of hers. Intern Casey overheard and offered to look her up and possibly her relatives. Later, she stood in the audience as Maggie gave an interview about finding her biological family in Seattle, which Jo took as a sign to find her own biological mother. Speaking from experience, Jackson warned her that it can also make for a negative experience. For him, it only created more pain. After saying goodbye Alex and Helen as they left for their trip back to Iowa, Jo looked up Casey and asked if he could find her birth mother. He said he could and asked if she wanted him to. She said yes, after which he revealed he couldn't help himself and had already found her. He showed her a picture and told her her name was Vicki Rudin and that she lived in Pittsburgh.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> After Alex returned, she booked a ticket to Pittsburgh to go meet her mother. Alex was worried over what would happen, but she told him that the worst that could happen was that her mother wouldn't want to see her, and then she'd just come home to him and at least she'd know.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jo meets her mother.]]\nIn Pittsburgh, Jo went to Vicki's big house and introduced herself. She immediately discovered that Vicki had two kids. Thinking she was a saleswoman, Vicki tried to end the conversation, but Jo name dropped Emerson Hospital. Vicki started to give directions, but Jo clarified that that was where she was born before she was left at a fire station on th Street. She then told Vicki she was her mother. Vicki told Jo she couldn't be there, at which point Vicki's husband and dog came back from their walk. Vicki claimed Jo was a Mormon and her husband took the dog inside. Jo then asked Vicki for one conversation at a diner nearby. Vicki didn't answer and just closed the door. Jo went to the diner and waited for quite a while. Just when she gave up and got ready to leave, Vicki showed up.\n\nReluctantly, she sat down and told Jo she was late for work at the Mayor's office. Jo then brought up her big house and family. She told Vicki she didn't need money. She told Vicki she had always thought that her mother had a terrible life and had no choice but to leave Jo. Vicki told her that she wanted a better life for Jo than she could give her. Jo inquired about Vicki's kids and husband, who Vicki told her was not her father. Jo then threw in her face that she never found that better life Vicki had wanted for her. No one found her adoring parents and she lived in foster homes so bad that as soon as a man told her he loved her, she believed him so bad that she couldn't see he was abusing her. She sincerely hoped that whatever life Vicki had, it was worse than that. Distraught, Vicki got up to leave. Jo commented at least she was consistent. Vicki then told her she succeeded if she came here to punish her. Jo said she just wanted to know where she came from. Vicki sat back down and talked about her heritage and family medical history, but Jo got all that from the DNA test. She wanted information that that test couldn't provide her with. Vicki sarcastically dashed out some trivia about herself. Jo then asked about her father so she could find him, to which Vicki coldly replied that he died in a motorcycle accident  years. She had hoped for a more painful death after all the hurt he had caused her. Thinking Vicki was just bitter because her childhood sweetheart didn't pan out, Jo got up to leave. Vicki then clarified that the man hurt her. She begged Jo to sit down. Jo complied. Vicki shared that he was a TA when she was a freshman in undergrad. He chased after her for weeks for a date and serenaded her with flowers and proclamations. Finally, she said yes to the date. Then she said no on the date when he started to kiss and touch her, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. Nine months later, she had Jo and five days later, she didn't.\n\nVicki told Jo how she managed to hide her pregnancy. Years after the rape, Vicki found her way to therapy, which is the first time she ever talked about it. It was only then that she came to terms with the word rape, because she had consented to the date. Somehow, because she knew the man, she thought that what he took from her didn't matter, but she found a way to realize that it did and to move forward. Jo questioned why she never once tried to find her. Vicki said she was petrified every moment of the pregnancy. She had to see that man every day in class and she was terrified Jo would be a boy who would have his face and voice. Every movement of Jo as a fetus reminded her of where the baby came from. But books and movies and magazines talk about this instantaneous love you feel the minute your baby is born. She kept telling herself that as soon as she had the baby in her arms, it would happen to her, too. She gave the hospital a fake name and on the same day as giving birth, she went home with Jo because she had get out of there. She wanted it to be the two of them and stare at her and hold her until that love came. It did come. Her heart cracked wide open, but it was never just the two of them. Everything about Jo reminded her of him. That's why she had to give her up.\n\nJo talked about being abandoned caused her to leave people that loved her before they could leave her and that every moment of her life, she was waiting for her mother to find her and tell her she was sorry about that. Vicki said she did the best she could. Jo replied that would have been to find her a loving family instead of tossing her aside like garbage. Vicki said it's easy to look back and see what she could have been done better, but she was a different person back then. She wasn't in her right mind. Vicki shared details of her rape and said that was the night she lost her right mind. He stole that for her and for nine months, she pretended she was fine. The day Jo was born, she could feel again for the first time since the rape, but her mind took years to come back and part of it never did. Vicki admitted Jo deserved better, but she really didn't have better to give her. Jo shared how she was seven weeks pregnant when her ex-husband cracked her ribs and threw her across the living room floor. She decided in that moment he could never know about the pregnancy. She couldn't see a way out back then. She knew leaving him would mean he'd kill her and she couldn't raise a kid in that fear and danger, so she had an abortion. She had never told anyone. Jo tried to take Vicki's hand to comfort her, but Vicki pulled away. Jo then asked if she looked like her father. Vicki admitted she did, a few features aside. Vicki apologized and said she was still doing the best she could. She then walked out, leaving a distraught Jo behind.<ref>[[Silent All These Years]], x</ref> Alex found her in bed at night. She pretended to be asleep, but as he got ready for bed, she continued crying.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nShe started to avoid Alex by going to work while he was in the shower. He found her at work and told her she could tell him what had happened, but she used a grant application for her fellowship as an excuse to go find Bailey, who would resume her Chief duties the next day. She ran into a confused and wounded [[Abby Redding]] in the lobby and Jo took her to the ER. Jo and Dahlia got ready to stitch up her face lac, which she claimed was caused by a cabinet door. However, as soon as Andrew showed up with a message from Bailey, Abby tightly grabbed Jo's hand upon seeing him. Jo caught that there was something going and had Andrew tell Bailey that she would be a while. After noticing that Abby was experiencing abdominal pain, too, Jo had Dahlia close the curtains and sent her away. Abby then revealed bruises all over her body and Jo promised her she was not going anywhere.\n\nDahlia and Jo took her private exam room and Teddy joined them. They asked if they could call someone, but Abby didn't want to bother her husband on his business trip. Teddy got consent to check for internal injuries with an ultrasound. Jo held her hand throughout the procedure. Teddy diagnosed a tear in her diaphragm, which would require surgery. Abby consented as she really wanted it to be over. Teddy asked Jo to speak privately, but Abby refused to let her go. Suspicious of a possible sexual assault, Teddy had Dahlia book an OR and inform the nurses to hold off on antibiotic prep as to not erase any evidence. The doctors offered to get her a counselor, but Abby didn't want any more doctors. Abby continued to make up excuses for her bruises. Jo then bluntly said she thought her husband was abusing her, possibly sexually assault. Abby firmly defended her husband and asked to be taken to the OR. Jo stressed that that would mean washing away all the evidence. Abby denied she had anything to report. Jo informed her they could gather the evidence and seal it away until she was ready to report the assault. Abby said women are never believed. She admitted she was raped after getting drunk at a bar after a fight with her husband with laundry, but the short skirt and tequila would make it all her fault while her rapist's drink would be his excuse. Abby broke down and said the kit wouldn't prove that she wasn't flirting or that she wasn't making this up to cover up her cheating on her husband. Jo, still holding Abby's hand, then shared how her husband abused her for years. She, too, was convinced no one would believe her. She never had the chance to hold him responsible so she couldn't imagine what Abby was feeling at the moment, but one day, she might feel different and want justice. Jo just wanted her to have everything she would need to get it. Abby said her husband could never find out and then consented to the evidence kit. Jo continued to hold her hand as Abby consented to every step of the kit. As soon as it was over, Abby started shaking and sobbing and Jo comforted her.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jo walks Abby along the wall of women.]]\nWith Abby's condition worsening, they had to take her to the OR, but Abby started panicking. She couldn't bring herself to leave the room. She said every man had her rapist's face. It's all she could see. She begged the doctors not to make her see his face. Jo promised her she wouldn't have to. She came up with a plan and asked female staff to line the hallway from the room all the way to the elevator up to the OR floor. She held Abby's hand as they wheeled her all the way along the wall of women to the operating table. Jo promised Abby she would stay by her side. She held Abby's hand while Teddy fixed the tear. Teddy shared that she had seen many rape victims who had no clue how to talk about it. What Jo did today was not protocol, but she thought that it should be.\n\nIn post-op, they informed her the surgery had gone well and that they would keep the kit here until Abby decided to report it, if ever. While that decision was hers to make, the doctors urged her to talk to someone. Abby talked about she kept going through the night to see what she could have done differently to avoid it. Teddy firmly said it was not her fault. She did nothing to deserve this. Teddy left Abby with Jo. Abby said her husband would look at her and see a broken person. She thought that would be all he'd ever see if she were to tell him. Jo told her this did not define her. Whether she would tell people or not, she was a survivor. Jo shared that men in expensive shoes still make her nauseous because that's how Paul made her kidney bleed. For years, she thought she got what she deserved, that was responsible, that she could have avoided it if she had done some things differently. Abby told her that was not her fault and then realized the same was true for her. She then asked Jo for a phone to call her husband and asked for Jo to stay with her. Jo promised she'd stay as long as Abby needed her to.\n\nLater, Jo stood in the doorway as Abby gave her statement to the police with her husband by her side. Alex caught up with her and asked to go out to dinner to celebrate his no longer being Chief. She told him she had had a rough day and didn't feel like celebrating. She wanted to go home and crawl into bed. Alex wanted to join her, but she told him to go celebrate with Meredith. Alex tried to get her to open up about her birth mother, stating he wouldn't judge given his family history, but Jo insisted she didn't want to or could talk about it. She said she needed to go home alone and sleep and walked off without him.<ref>[[Silent All These Years]], x</ref>\n\nThe whole Pittsburgh experience triggered her abandonment issues and it made Jo clinically depressed. She kept Alex to leave her alone if he loved her and she claimed that she was sick so she could stay home from work and lie in bed all day. Worried about her, Alex sent over Link. He came by with chicken soup and forced her to let him in. While he grabbed bowls and spoons, she just climbed back into bed, disinterested in anything he had to say. He then started doing laundry for her. She told him to go, but he recalled a time a girlfriend dumped him and he drank for three days and he was so miserable, but she wouldn't leave him then despite his objections and she did his laundry for him, too. Jo then fetched a bottle of vodka from the freezer.\n\nThey got drunk together and she told him that that girlfriend had done him a favor by dumping him. She said she had done many people that favor, too. She talked about dating this guy named Logan while working at another restaurant. They dated for a while and the first time he told her he loved her, it made her feel the opposite of what it should. She felt like he was wrong for loving her, that she could not be loved, so she left, moved to another part of town and got a new job like none of it ever happened. She did the same thing to a guy in high school. And then she met Paul. She said her mother was and is a runner, too. She claimed she loved Jo, but she couldn't stand to be in the same room as her. She briefly tried to talk about her father, but she teared up and instead got another bottle of vodka. When Alex came home, he found her laughing hysterically at a cartoon. While he thought she was doing better, Link told him she was in a rough shape unlike anything he'd ever seen before. He was convinced she needed help, but he didn't know how to help her.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nAlex convinced Jo to come back to work but her colleagues couldn't behave normal around her. Jackson found her buried in a mountain of work in her lab as a result of Bailey's being Chief again and her absence. To take her mind off it, he invited her to help him out on his spray-on skin project. She accepted, but continuously called the work boring and shut down every attempt Jackson made at asking about her birth mother, only telling him that he had been right to advice her not to do it. He pointed out she must have needed it to try since she did it. Looking back, she didn't understand why as she had everything to be happy and she just threw it all aside for nothing, and now it felt impossible to get that happiness back. She was convinced talking to Alex would only hurt more. Jackson revealed Meredith had asked him to check in on her. Jo says her coming to work was a sign of her doing her best. He knew that she came to work drunk and had vodka stored in her water bottle. He was glad she at least had the decency to do research instead of see patients today. He invited her to talk, but she declined. He told her she would not be met with compassion if she came to work drunk ever again. Alex found out about her being drunk at work and threatened to go to Pittsburgh himself to find out what happened. She told him she would leave him if he ever brought that up again and again told him that she would talk to him when she was ready to. They made a deal that he would tell Bailey if she came to work drunk again, so she promised not to do that anymore.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nAlex put her on LEGO duty with Gus to avoid her having to deal with real cases. While she was building with Gus, a nurse came to fetch Jo to answer a call from the Head of Trauma at a hospital in Winnipeg. The doctor told her they had an Rh-Null patient and found Gus in a database. Excited, Jo told the doctor that she would find Alex and call her right back. She ran into Lori on her way to find him and shared that they found a donor. She also told Alex, who called her a good luck charm and gave her instructions to prepare Gus for the OR. Jo then called the doctor back and found out that the doctor was calling to see if Gus could donate for her patient, not the other way around. Upon returning to Gus's room, she overheard Lori making a call to her husband to share the news. Jo broke down and ran off. Ben found her sobbing in the hallway and tried to comfort her, but she ran off. She found Teddy and told her what happened and begged her to call in a favor from the military to correct the mistake. Teddy told her it wasn't a matter of jumping the line; there was no line to jump. Teddy tried to calm her down but found that Jo kept spiraling, so she asked Jo if she was doing okay. She offered to come talk to Lori with her, but Jo declined. Jo delivered the bad news. Lori lashed out because she had to call all these people back with bad news. Jo then broke down and Alex and Bailey found her sobbing in Lori's arms. Alex took her away and left her with Ben, who comforted Jo while Alex vented his despair over Jo's state of being in Bailey's office.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAlex switched places with Meredith in hopes that Meredith could get through to Jo. Meredith was determined to stay at the loft until Jo talked to her and ignored Jo's attempts to push her away. Meredith talked to her about understanding of pain, which came from deep experience, in an attempt to make Jo see that she would be able understand her pain. Jo told her that unless her father raped her mother and she looked just like him, she couldn't understand this. Jo then finally opened up and shared this experience of watching a girl who hurt herself in the playground be comforted by her mother. Ever since she was a kid, she imagined that her mother would hold her like that mother held her daughter if she ever found her, but now she knew that would never happen. She said she never should have existed in the first place and that everything that Paul had put her through was just her birthright.\n\nMeredith listed things that Jo helped her out with at work, how her love changed Alex, and how she prevented Paul from further abusing his fianc\uee. That was proof that violence was not her inheritance but something she had overcome. She told Jo she had an enormous heart and capacity for survival. She had survived something dark and used that experience to help other people, and if her mother couldn't see that, then that was on her. Meredith told her about her drowning and how she gave up, but the people who loved her pulled her through. That's why she was there with her. She asked Jo if she wanted to stop or if she just needed a few more days. Jo replied the latter. Meredith then told her they were going to talk to Bailey and Alex to get her a proper leave of absence so she could get the help that she needed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jo asks Meredith to go tell Alex while she waits for Bailey.]]\nThey arrived at the hospital and found that Bailey and Catherine were in a meeting. Jo asked Alex to go talk to Alex as she couldn't bring herself to do that, while she would wait for Bailey to finish her meeting. Meredith ordered Andrew to stay by Jo's side, but Bailey called him into the conference room.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith's insurance fraud was discovered and Andrew had taken the fall for her. With him arrested and several attendings out, Bailey asked Jo if she could work. Jo said she could and went to the ER. She and Link waited for ambulances to bring in victims of the car pile-up that was caused by the fog. Link used the fog as a metaphor to tell Jo that despite her current state, the sun would shine again. They laughed at how bad that was. Bailey soon joined them and she agreed to talk with Jo later. The first ambulance brought in Owen and [[Frances Pinfield]], Gus's agoraphobic blood donor from London. Jo and Levi took her to get her blood drawn and Frances talked about how there was something freeing about being forced to walk through your worst fears. Jo then took the blood to Gus in the hyperbaric medicine lab. After the transfusion, she stayed behind to tell Alex, whom Meredith had informed about the cause of Jo's depression, that she was not fine despite her knowing how to rise when she had to. He promised her they would figure it out. He took her to the in-patient psychiatry department, where [[Olivia Fowler|Dr. Olivia Fowler]] got her checked in after she said goodbye to Alex.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nDuring her checking in, Jo was rid off all things that might be a danger to her and she brought to her room, where she lied down and cried. After a week, she and Alex decided to have her committed into a psychiatric facility. Alex dropped her off and she told him she didn't want to be another name on his list of crazy people. She reminded him they weren't married and offered him an out. He didn't respond, so she just walked away and checked herself in.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShe met her therapists, one of whom was [[Carly Davis]]. Carly wanted to try to EMDR and since Jo had no interest in being there, she offered to let Jo go if she could explain EMDR in  seconds or less. She failed to mention how it illuminates your capital T, trauma, so Carly made her stay. Jo denied having undergone trauma and commented on Carly not sharing any of her almonds, which Carly attributed to maintaining boundaries with her patients. They then started the EMDR therapy, which brought up that Jo felt shame for not being in her safe place, the OR. When asked about memories that gave her the same feeling, Jo admitted she kept replaying her mother pulling her hand away at the diner over and over. Carly stated they'd work on that. However, Jo didn't feel like doing the work and tried to sneak out in the middle of the night. As the therapist on guarding duty, Carly caught her. She had suspected Jo would run off. Jo admitted she didn't know why she wanted to run as she was feeling shame for things she didn't do but instead for things that were done to her. Carly pointed out Jo was used to being exceptional while at this point, she was like everyone else in the facility, mentally, stuck in one moment that seemed like it was defining her entire life. Carly thought it was not about her mother walking away from her and told her she would need to move through the fear and shame to anger. Jo told her she couldn't do that, meaning she would be stuck there forever.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nAfter three weeks, she and Alex met with her doctor present. Jo told him that during her depressive episode, she felt fear, shame, and pain. She was ashamed that she had lost the ability to receive the love that he was giving. She had pushed him away and she was afraid she would never be able to regain his trust. Jo thought he had had enough crazy for a lifetime and said he deserved someone stronger than her. Her doctor pointed out that her decision to come to the facility made her stronger than most, in spite of what society made her believe.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Jo reached that stage of anger and burst into Carly's office to tell her she hated everything; her mother and her pulling away, her rapist father, and Paul. With a smile, Carly pointed out she had made a breakthrough by moving into the anger. Jo told her she couldn't get angry because she was afraid she could never stop being angry and then she would become like Paul. Carly informed her she needed to learn what healthy anger looked like. Jo thought she was preparing her for another EMDR session and said she couldn't have that now. Carly was proud of her for finally asking for what she wanted. She brought out a bucket of soft toys and started throwing them at the wall. She invited Jo to join her and told her they were consenting adults who were okay with throwing things at walls instead of people. That set them apart from Paul since they were feeling the anger yet still controlling their behavior. She then started throwing the toys hard and started screaming until the anger had left her body. They sat down and Carly shared that she used to be a Safe Haven volunteer. No matter how fast she would get to a fire station after a call, the baby was always wrapped up in a warm blanket, surrounded by love, when she got there. She explained that while Jo didn't have a memory of her mother abandoning her, her brain and body had a memory of her pulling away, which was triggered by what happened at the diner. However, despite that, it was important for Jo to remember that, just like as a baby, she was still surrounded by love.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nAt the end of her treatment a week later, she was surprised when Alex showed up to pick her up. He got on one knee and admitted he had thought about leaving her because he was scared, but he had come to realize that he was stronger with her by his side, in sickness and health. She reminded him she wasn't magically fixed, but he didn't care and asked her to marry him again. She happily accepted and they shared a kiss.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOn her first day back to work, Jo prepared herself to be looked at like she was a fragile bird. Alex wanted to smooth things over and offered her a job at Pac-North, allowing her to run her own fellowship, but Jo's therapist had told her that she needed to return to her life without making too many changes, so she went back to Grey Sloan. Bailey was surprised to see her and, upon hearing Alex's offer, made her the exact same one. Jo took the day to think about them and ran into Link, who told her that Amelia was pregnant with his child. While she listened to his concerns about raising a child, Alex called her to check in on her and offered to make her an attending general surgeon after hearing about Bailey's counteroffer. She returned to Link and assured him he would be a great dad if he wanted to be one. Afterwards, she found Bailey and requested to be made attending general surgeon at Grey Sloan, stating she knew her worth and would be an asset to any hospital, which Bailey could decide could be her hospital. Bailey and Jo talked in her office and Bailey conceded. Jo came home and told Alex that she had leveraged his offer to make Bailey hire her at Grey Sloan. Alex recognized that Grey Sloan was better for her career and advised her to demand a parking space, to which Jo replied that Bailey had given her his parking space.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nBailey made a concession by allowing Jo to perform an ALPPS procedure in her first week as an attending to express her trust in Jo's capabilities. However, [[Shirley Gregory|the patient]] didn't want to let anybody but Meredith operate on her despite Jo having been trained by Meredith. Jo then got Bailey to consent to having Meredith supervise her every move through video chat, during which Meredith convinced the patient that Jo was great, which got her to consent. The surgery went well despite a small touch-and-go moment with an unexpected bleeding, which Jo handled. After she finished, Bailey and the entire staff applauded for her. While Meredith was in the middle of congratulating Jo, Bailey hung up on her.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith's article was published as a slash-and-burn expos\ue on Grey Sloan, Jo was concerned for the hospital. She went to Bailey to request to be allowed to schedule more ALPPS procedures for her but Bailey was too busy handling the fall-out of the article to hear her. However, when Bailey commented she felt hot, Jo suggested the stress may have gotten to her heart, which worried Bailey. Later, Meredith pulled Jo into a staircase to find out how the hospital was coping with the negative press. Jo admitted it had the residents panicking while the other staff was divided between supporting her and loathing her. Jo stated she was worried about Bailey's health and wished Meredith good luck when she heard Meredith wanted to clear the air between them. Afterwards, she ran into Jackson and told him it must be freeing for Meredith to do what she felt was right without worrying about the optics, which inspired Jackson to do the right thing with [[Clervie Martin]].<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Jo came across Bailey and Levi as they wheeled [[Carly Davis]] into the hyperbaric chamber to treat a carbon monoxide poisoning. Jo recognized her and inserted herself onto the case, taking Levi's place. Once the chamber was sealed, Bailey found how Jo was connected to Carly. Jo explained she was just one of her three therapists at the center. Bailey inquired why Carly had wanted to commit suicide but Jo had no clue. She noticed how her hands shook as she worked. She laughed about having forgotten everything Carly had taught her about keeping her nervous system calm. She continued to panic and stated she was back to square one. She wanted to leave but couldn't because the chamber was sealed. She wondered what it meant for her if the one person who was supposed to make her feel better could go off and attempt suicide. She started listing the steps of a chest tube, which was a trick she had learnt in therapy to calm herself. However, as it didn't work and she kept spiraling, Bailey blurted out that she was pregnant in order to distract Jo, which worked. Bailey admitted to being excited but terrified. Jo corrected her and said both feelings could coexist at the same. Bailey started to panic, too, so Jo now had her recite something she knew by heart to calm her down, which worked on her. Carly then inexplicably started seizing after starting to get better, which lead to Jo suggesting she was diabetic, which she figured was the reason behind Carly's incessant almond eating. They corrected her hypoglycemia, which improved her status.\n\nCarly was taken to the ICU and Jo insisted on seeing the case through. Before she headed into the room to check on Carly, Bailey told her she had watched Jo teeter on the edge and bring herself as well as Bailey back from that all the while saving Carly's life, which told her Jo was far from back at square one. Carly then woke up and Jo informed her she was calling psych as was required for all suicide attempts. Carly revealed she hadn't tried to kill herself. Her CO detector battery had been dead for months and she passed out while reading a book. Jo then decided she couldn't be Carly's doctor anymore because of boundaries, which made Carly proud. At home that night, Jo told Alex she had had a rough day but didn't want to talk about it; Instead, she started throwing toys at the wall to get herself to an okay state of mind. Alex joined her and the laughed as he hit a lamp.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nJo had the day off on Halloween and she decided to stay home and scare trick-or-treaters with her bloodied bride costume, which had failed to scare Alex. Jo tried to sneak up on him at Pac-North to scare him but to no avail. He told her a graveyard was discovered in the construction site outside and had her help out when several patients in the ICU started crashing simultaneously, which made Jo believe the hospital was haunted. Together, Alex, Jo, and Owen figured out all patients had received transfusions from blood that had been stored in a faulty fridge. While Alex handled the crisis with investors walking around, Jo waited for him in his office. He came in and said he had impressed the investors with his ability to handle chaos, which is why they awarded him with the funding he had been after. To celebrate, he took Jo to the courthouse to get married. While still wearing her bloodied wedding dress, she told him she was pregnant during her vows. He was startled and she laughed as she finally got to scare him. She assured him she was not pregnant and the ceremony continued.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing before the medical committee, Jo warned the residents that they were on their own since most of the attendings were out to attend the hearing, like Jo herself. She warned her to only call her for urgent matters. After finishing up at the hospital, she took off to the hotel. She arrived late, just in time to watch a distressed Levi storm out of the room. She was informed he had been the one to report Meredith to Bailey. Later, she assisted Alex with his surprise of bringing in a group of patients who had been treated and saved by Meredith as well as reading letters of support by former colleagues of Meredith's. Jo was among the group who heard the verdict and congratulated Meredith as she got to keep her license.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nLink and Amelia came across a stressed-out Jo at the hospital. She informed them she had signed up to become a Safe Haven volunteer, like Carly, and had just received a call about a baby having been dropped off at [[SFD Station ]]. Since Alex was out of town to see his mother, she asked Link to come with her. Since he thought she was taking on too much too soon, he offered to cancel his surgery but she declined and said she'd be fine. She entered the station and met [[Victoria Hughes]], whom she recognized as Jackson's girlfriend. [[Dean Miller]] and Ben then brought over the baby, whom they estimated to be three days old. Ben then gave Jo a tour. They sat down in the break room to feed the baby. Jack came by and she told him she had been dropped off at a fire station as a baby herself. They then bonded over having been in the foster system. [[Jack Gibson|Jack]] informed her the SFD has about seven babies per year who are left stations. Jo thought there'd be more abandoned babies. Ben pointed out they use the word \"surrendered\" and try not to judge. While feeding the baby, Jo told Ben she had thought volunteering would be different. She had expected to feel an understanding and forgiveness for her mother but it actually had the opposite effect. Ben reminded her of the effect trauma can have on people. Ben offered her a ride to the hospital so she could drop the baby off as the baby's exam was all good. Jo added he was all good except for the fact that his parents didn't want him. Ben said the people who gave birth to the baby didn't want him; he had yet to meet his parents. Ben dropped her off at the hospital but he ran off as he received a worrying text about Bailey, leaving Jo alone at the ER entrance. She then turned around and took the baby home. Link came to visit her after a distressing call and as he saw the baby there, she admitted it was too much too soon.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nJo explained to Link she wanted the baby to have one cozy night. Link pointed out she did something illegal. Meredith came over to vent about Cormac and understood Jo's decision regarding the baby. When they got paged for the traumas resulting from a car crash into Joe's bar, Jo decided to sneak the baby into the nursery and pretend he had been there all night. In the nursery, she met [[Cormac Hayes]] and realized he was the one that Cristina had sent for Meredith. He had heard great things about Alex. The exam turned out fine and Cormac gave Jo a few minutes before involving social services. He talked about having missed his own two boys growing up as he was a resident back when they were little. Jo cuddled the boy and told him he would have people looking out for him despite his bumpy start. After handing him over to the social worker, Jo told Link she had fallen in love with that boy a little bit. He understood, having a child on the way himself, and invited her to come hang with his child anytime. Later, Jo caught a glimpse of Meredith chatting with Cormac and told her that she could see something happening between the two.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working a busy ER shift, Link told Jo that Amelia's baby might not be his. They scrubbed in for surgery and he told Jo that it wouldn't change anything for him and that Amelia didn't want a paternity test anyway. Jo pointed out he didn't just have to be okay with it and that he could love her and be mad at her at the same time.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref> After Link convinced Amelia to get a paternity test anyway, Amelia began to avoid him. Jo ran into her and told her that Link was allowed to have his feelings and that she should stop avoiding him. She added that you should give the people you love all the information in order to give them the chance to rise to the occasion. She admitted Alex was ignoring her, which make her anxious. She later ran into [[Joey Phillips]] and, using her own history with the foster system, made him see that he had to take care of himself before he could be reunited with his siblings. She and Bailey operated on his arm to restore proper blood flow. Jo said Joey had a tough time ahead as no one would adopt a -year-old boy who looked like he could fend for himself. As they watched him sleep post-op, Jo told a worried Bailey that both she and Alex had been like Joey and that the two of them turned out fine. She then went home to her empty loft.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nDespite Jo's attempt to reconcile the two, Amelia continued to ignore Link, much like Alex kept ignoring Jo. A patient of hers had jumped in front of a bear to protect his wife and Jo felt like a bear was headed for her and Link. Link assured her Alex would tell her all about his family situation when he returned. Jo told Link that Amelia was like this sometimes, citing the time Amelia ignored Owen and camped out on Stephanie's couch. She and Owen found out that the woman who had been saved by her husband was actually cheating on him. That together with Alex ignoring her made Jo think about the worst case scenarios as to why Alex was keeping her in the dark. Later, Jo had to inform her patient that her husband had died, causing her to turn down the man she has been cheating with. After witnessing the heartbreak, Jo left Alex a message asking him to call her as she needed to know what was going on, whatever it was. She concluded by saying she would jump in front of a bear for him.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> During the Seattle blizzard, Jo had a busy day taking care of [[Tess Anderson]]. She decided to reach out to [[Helen Karev]] and found out that Alex wasn't with her, nor had he been. While sitting alone at home with a glass of wine, she heard movement at the door and rushed to open it, believing Alex had finally returned. Instead, it was Link, who had come to bring her some comfort food. Jo told Link about what she had found, which had convinced her that Alex had truly left her. She broke down and Link comforted her.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nSince she couldn't bear to live in the loft by herself, she temporarily stayed at Link's place. He went by her place to pick up some of her stuff and brought it to the hospital with him. He also brought her her mail, which included a letter from Alex. Link offered to sit with her but she wanted to read it on her own. He wrote that he didn't want to do it like this, that she deserved more than this. He wrote that he loved her, her bravery and resilience, all of her. However, he had to tell her that he was also in love with Izzie. He recalled the time he told her about the life he had imagined for Izzie with kids and that he was now suddenly a part of that picture. He confessed that he had used Meredith's trial as an excuse to reach out to her and they got to talking and it felt like no time had passed. He was now living on a farm with Izzie and he felt like belonged there, because Izzie had his kids. He knew that Jo would understand that he couldn't leave and miss another second of their lives after having already missed five years. He hoped Jo loved him enough to let him take the chance to make his kids' lives whole, to give them the family he and Jo had never had. He wanted to do everything he could to make that life work. He stressed that he had meant everything about his life with Jo and that he wished getting the family that he always wanted didn't mean having to hurt Jo in the process. He admitted he couldn't come back to tell her in person because he wouldn't be able to walk away from her again. He thanked her for taking care of him, for making him kinder. He got her divorce papers and decided to leave her everything, including his shares in Grey Sloan, because she deserved everything good in life. He ended his letter by writing he hoped she could find someone better than him and apologized once more. After she was done reading the letter, Link wanted to take her day drinking but she decided to focus on her work, scrubbing in with Maggie. Link told her she was his hero. She shared the sentiment.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAs she couldn't bear to be in the loft by herself, Link moved in with her to keep her company while he was working out his problems with Amelia. En route to work, Jo uttered disgust over a young couple making out on the platform, stating all love sucks eventually. At work, the young man was brought after having been electrocuted after falling onto the tracks. Link and Jo operated on the man with Amelia. He pulled through but he would need extensive physical therapy. His lover did not want to stay and take care of him while she was supposed to move to England to pursue her dream. Link commented on how fast their love fizzled out, thinking Jo had been right. However, Jo had changed her mind. She tried to hate Alex but couldn't bring herself to do that. While she was mad and hurt over his leaving her, the love he had shown her made grow as a person so she was confident she could get back on her feet. He made her feel worthy of love and she would always remember that. She then advised Link not to blow things with Amelia, who at least had given Link a choice. Jo then went to the bar by herself, where Andrew tried to hit on her. She threw her drink in his face and told him to get help.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>  \n\nOn Meredith's pro bono surgery day, Meredith called Jo at  am to request her help. Jo got off her couch, where she had been sleeping since Alex left, took off her wedding ring, and headed into work. She got word from Link that Amelia's baby was his. As Meredith divided her patients between the surgeons who had agreed to participate, she wondered how to address Jo now. Jo decided she would go by \"Dr. Jo\" until further notice. After turning down an invitation from Jackson to go to a game with him, Jo scrubbed in with Owen. He went to express his sympathies for her but she didn't want to be reminded of Alex while in her happy place. He let her know she was always welcome if she were in need of company. After a long day at work, Jo came across a sad Levi at the bar. He had broken up with Nico and was out of a place to live. Jo then invited him to stay with her. She explained the loft was too empty and she didn't want to be chased out of the place she had bought for herself. Levi gladly accepted her offer.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nJo and Levi subsequently developed a close friendship. He told her about the little things his mom did for him while he used to live with her, which Jo commented didn't sound so bad. With all the attendings gathering for Richard's case, Jo was put in charge of the ER, where Levi came to help her out. He was distracted all day by focusing on Nico's social media posts until Jo pointed out he was missing his chance to shine. At night, Levi came home while Jo was watching TV and he announced he was moving out, because he had taken her comments to mean that he was overstaying his welcome. She explained she was snapping at him as his superior but his presence at home was the only thing keeping her sane, so she convinced him to stay.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working a case with Cormac and Jackson, Jo contemplated using a dating app but decided she was feeling too miserable to date yet. Cormac expressed hate over being set up, at which point Jo hinted that he had his own personal matchmaker. He inquired about her comment but she brushed it off, choosing not to share her knowledge of Cristina's intentions for him and Meredith.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nNear the end of March , Jo approached Jackson to ask him for sex. She wanted to have sex with someone she trusted to get over Alex, like a bridge to the other side of feeling like a sad sack. While surprised by her random proposition, Jackson accepted and they agreed to meet up that night. She showed up at his place with a bottle of booze and found he had set up for a date with romantic music. She mocked him for that and they shared the bottle she brought while she commented on having never been with someone as rich as him. They then proceeded to make out until Jo started sobbing. They stopped and he comforted her on the couch.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\n\nShortly after their disastrous encounter, the coronavirus hit the United States. They worked the frontlines at Grey Sloan Memorial as Seattle was one of the cities hit hardest in April . They worked together with some awkward tension on [[Kayden Lee]], a kid who broke quarantine to go party with his friends and ended up being burned. As they scrubbed in for his surgery, Jo commented that people do stupid things. During the surgery, Jo continued to snap at Jackson. They managed to stabilize Kayden. Once he got settled in his room, Jackson told Jo he could apologize for their awkward encounter if that would help her be less angry. She revealed she was actually ashamed for crying and snotting into his mouth rather than angry at him. She admitted she hadn't been ready for casual sex. They agreed to pretend their encounter had never happened so they could go back to being friends.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nWith their friendship, Jo found Jackson in Kayden's room to get an update for Kayden's father. They found that Kayden's burns had gone through his chest wall. They rushed him back to surgery. Together with Teddy and Maggie, they tried to save him but lost him on the table. Jo found a crying Teddy in the attendings' lounge. Having heard about her affair with Tom, she told Teddy she had no sympathy for her. Teddy snapped at her to mind her own business, to which Jo replied that Teddy was to blame for having blown up her own life. Teddy bluntly said it wasn't her fault that Alex had left Jo and she questioned if Jo had never hurt someone she loved or sabotaged her own happiness because it felt so unfamiliar. Jo then softened up a little and advised Teddy to try harder to talk to Owen.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref> At some point during the pandemic, Jo started going to virtual therapy three times a week to process Alex leaving her.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith was admitted with COVID, Jo took over her service. Jo and Levi watched a message from Richard together, stating there were enough tests available for all personnel and that residents were no longer allowed to work on patients with an unknown COVID status. Jo was working the ER. She had a brief run-in with Link, who was adjusting to life as a new dad. Levi came to fetch Jo for [[Val Ashton]], a patient with abdominal pain. Val's labs revealed that she was pregnant yet the ultrasound didn't show a fetus. A scan revealed a hepatic pregnancy. Carina and Jo planned to deliver the baby as soon as possible since the placental growth could cause a major bleeding. After multiple rounds of failed IVF over  years, Val was delighted that a drunken one-night stand had given her a baby after her ex-husband had blamed her as the reason for them not being able to conceive. She consented to the surgery and said she was ready to meet her baby girl Luna. Cormac and Carina rushed Luna to the NICU while Bailey and Jo took care of Val, with Jo standing up to Bailey for her surgical plan. Afterward, Bailey found Jo spending time with the baby in the NICU and told her that her work had not gone unnoticed. While appreciative of her comments, Jo said Meredith had to get better. Bailey agreed. Jo spent the rest of the night by Luna's side.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nJust as Jo found out that murder hornets had been spotted in the U.S., Jackson invited Jo to come hang out at his place. She accepted as long as he was paying for the food. Over beers that night, they talked about Meredith. Jo reminisced about the long way they had come since the time that Meredith used to kick Jo out of Alex's bed. Jackson said Meredith was a force of nature. They agreed she would beat the virus. Jo woke up the next morning on the couch. He had ordered them breakfast. She thanked him for their friendship reboot and then pulled him in for a kiss, stating she was ripping off the band-aid. They had amazing sex on the couch. Jo commented it was more than a bridge. They agreed to go again right away so it would all count as one time, so they wouldn't become a thing. Afterward, Jo headed to work and ran into Levi in the parking lot. He figured she had worked overnight since she wasn't home in the morning. She said she had been exercising. As Nico passed by, Jo derived from Levi's face that him and Nico were hooking up again. Levi defended himself by saying that the Dutch government had advised its citizens to find one designated sex partner to keep things safe during the pandemic. That inspired Jo to go back to Jackson's place that night. Thinking she was looking for something more, he told her he couldn't be in a relationship right now as he had moved on too soon after April and Maggie. Jo said that she was still working to put herself back together, so she only wanted a designated sex partner. He agreed to that and let her in.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she was called into a delivery due to hospital policy while passing through the hall, she discovered the joy of OB/GYN, and began to consider switching specialties amid a dark time in her life because surgery wasn't bringing her any happiness. When she decided to go for it, Bailey wouldn't approve of it at first due to the surgical staff shortage but later relented and Jo officially became an OB/GYN resident under [[Carina DeLuca]].\n\n\n\n[[Chris Cleaver]]\nChris was Jo's first boyfriend. In , when Jo was in high school and her car was about to be towed, Chris paid the driver so that he didn't take her car. They started dating and he liked that she lived in her car and wanted her to meet his parents. She agreed to meeting them, but when he asked her to move to his college with him, she took off and drove her car to another state.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\n[[Paul Stadler]]\nJo was married to Paul, but he was extremely abusive. One incident left her with an almost ruptured kidney. Another time, he cracked her ribs and threw her across the living room floor. Unbeknownst to Paul, Jo was  weeks pregnant at the time, but had an abortion soon after, because she knew he would kill her if she ran away, but she also knew she could not raise a child under Paul's fear and violence. Later, she ran from him for good, and she knew that if she filed a divorce, he would find her and possibly harm her, so she changed her identity and started a new life in another city, still technically married to him.\n\nYears later, Paul found Jo in Seattle and confronted her. He said to her that they needed to get divorced so that he and his [[Jenny (Season )|fianc\uee]] can get married. They signed divorce papers.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Paul became the victim of a hit-and-run, he suffered a concussion, but this was made worse when he injured his head on a bed frame and his brain began to swell, leaving him brain dead. Jo, who was still legally his wife as the divorce papers hadn't gone through yet, decided to donate his organs, stating that some good should come out of his death since his life brought evil.<ref>[[Personal Jesus]], x</ref>\n\n[[Jason Myers]]\nJo had a crush on Jason when she started working at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. Jo and the other interns gave Jason the nickname of Chest Peckwell. Eventually, Jo and Jason began a romantic relationship. However, Jason and Alex constantly butted heads over allegations that Alex had feelings for Jo. Alex would inform Jason of Jo's troubled past, causing an argument.  During that argument, Jason physically harmed Jo, causing her to move out and end the relationship. It was later revealed that Jo nearly killed Jason when she fought back, even to the extent of a brain bleed. He demanded to see the police but was convinced otherwise after being threatened by Alex.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShortly after first meeting her and telling her that he likes \"chicks with boy names,\" Jo assured Alex that as he had already slept with all of her friends, she wasn't interested in him.<ref>[[Love the One You're With]], x</ref> Alex frequently referred to Jo Wilson as \"princess\" due to her so-called 'prissy' manners and attitude. She revealed to Alex her past life difficulties and the two became close friends after bonding at Bailey's wedding. They got along very well and they often drank together. However, they hit a snag when Jo began dating [[Jason Myers]]. After a huge fight between Jo and Jason, Jo revealed to [[Alex Karev|Alex]] that [[Jason Myers|Jason]] had hit her during the argument. Alex admitted to Cristina that he loved Jo, but that he was scared to tell her because of past failed relationships. During the superstorm, Alex finally admitted to Jo that he loved her and the couple shared a kiss. They hit a bit of a rocky patch when Alex's dad came into the hospital from a car crash related to drugs. Alex asked Jo to do a paternity test and he said he didn't want to know at the same time she said: \"he's your father.\" Alex then proceeded to stalk his father at bars where he was performing. When Alex didn't come home for  nights in a row, Jo got worried. He then told her what was happening and they worked it out. Alex really knew he loved Jo then.\n\nWhen Alex's father returned to the hospital going through withdrawal, Jo tried to handle him but found herself in over her head. Alex told her it wasn't her fault and that he'd been this way his whole life. At April's wedding, Alex told Jo that they would be together forever and were the only family each other needs. He said that if they do have kids, they will be great parents and will not need anyone else then share a passionate kiss. When Alex called Jo his fianc\uee, she told him that she didn't realize his speech at the wedding was a proposal and that she was not walking out on him, but she wasn't ready for marriage. She comforted Alex when his dad died.\n\nWhen Leah issued a complaint to HR, the non-fraternization rule was put in place, forbidding unmarried couples of different authority levels to continue seeing each other. Alex and Jo faked a fight in front of the hospital, allowing them to believe they broke up while secretly staying together. Meredith gave Alex a love contract for them both to sign so they could continue working and seeing each other without getting into trouble. When Jo refused to sign it, Alex assured her that it wasn't a scary document to anything. She can't count on him because anything could happen at any minute. The contract just made it so that he could kiss her when he wants to. She signed and they shared a kiss. When Alex was offered a new job at a pediatric private practice, he sought Jo's advice and she was very supportive of him. She told him that working two jobs made him like a double agent which is very sexy. Alex took the job and Jo was very proud of him, telling him he'll do great.\n\nLater Alex proposed to Jo. She did not give him an answer and said she had to think about it. When he asked for a real answer, she said no. She was at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's Bar]] with Stephanie later that day and she got drunk. Stephanie then left her in the hands of [[Andrew DeLuca]]. He then took Jo home. She told Andrew how she rejected Alex\us proposal, and that she didn\ut want to. She confessed to him that she was married to a man who almost beat her to death. She then took off her shirt and pants in front of Andrew and she accidentally pulled him into the bed. Alex then walked in the apartment, and to him it looked like Andrew was trying to rape a drunk Jo, so Alex almost beat Andrew to death. Alex turned himself in after Andrew was brought to the hospital and went to jail, only to be bailed out by Meredith. Jo was frightened by this side of Alex and they broke up.\n\nWhile Alex was working in the clinic, Jo was subpoenaed to testify at Alex\us trial, she told him she was married. She said that it could all come out in court and that\us why she couldn\ut marry him. She wanted him to know if she just disappeared after the trial, it wasn\ut because of him, it was because she didn\ut want her husband to find her. Alex took this information and went to the DA to take the plea bargain he was offered. Andrew then heard about this and went to the DA to drop the charges.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Alex went to find Jo\us husband, [[Paul Stadler]], and confront him. He saw him but didn\ut confront him because he knew it would make things worse. Alex then found out that Jo wouldn\ut take him back because she was afraid he would hurt her. After Alex found this out, he went to Jo and confessed that he went to confront Paul, but he didn\ut do anything. He assured her that he\us done stupid things, but he would never hurt her. Ever. Jo then kissed him and they got back together.\n\nWhen Jo and Alex had a patient with a failed \"HoCoPro\", [[Pete Hover|Pete]], Jo waited for Alex after work with a sign that had \"Homecoming?\" written on it. Alex asked if Jo was asking him to a dance, but then Jo said that she wanted Alex to come home.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nJo saw how good Alex was with his patients, especially [[Kimmie Park|Kimmie]] and [[Charlie Peterson|Charlie]], so that night, when Alex came home, Jo had filled their apartment with candles. She started talking about how she and Alex together just made sense. Alex, realizing what was happening, went to find the engagement ring. When he couldn't find the ring, Jo showed him that she was wearing it. Jo knelt down in front of Alex and said, \"You are my home, and you are my heart. Alex Karev, will you marry me?\" Alex then kissed her and said, \"That's a hell yes\".\n\nAfter [[Kimmie Park|Kimmie]] left the hospital, Alex was sitting in her patient room when Jo walked in and told him that she wanted to have kids with him, and that she also wanted to take his name when they got married because she'd never had the last name of anyone who loved her.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nWhile stressing out about planning their wedding, [[April Kepner|April]] came to help them out. She told them she would plan their wedding, but when Alex was going through his bank account, he noticed something and didn't tell Jo for the rest of the day. That day, [[Olivia Jankovic|Nurse Olivia]] came back to the hospital with her son who has swallowed a whistle. Olivia then spent the day making fun of Alex for his past behavior, especially the time he gave her syphilis. When Olivia found out that Alex and Jo were engaged, she wished Jo \"the best of luck with that\". After Olivia and Alex talked, he was leaving and she said \"She's too good for you\" and to that Alex replied \"You don't think I know that\". But that night when Jo came home, she was worried about what Alex saw on his bank account and assured him that she didn't care if he was having money problems, but he told her there was too much money in the account and that his mother, [[Helen Karev]], hadn't been cashing the checks he'd been sending her. Alex and Jo then went to Iowa only to find that Alex's mom was doing great and back at work. When his mom said that his presence was upsetting her, Jo took him to the batting cage to calm down. Alex then went back to the library and introduced Jo to his mom.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nAt their wedding, Jo and Alex ignored the superstitions and went to a private place together to have pre-wedding sex and found themselves in a shed. They then got locked in the shed and couldn't get out until [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] and [[Andrew DeLuca|Andrew]] found them. At this point, Jo and Alex were late to their own wedding and they had to move locations because the wedding planner had an allergic reaction and there was blood all over everything. They all got on a ferry boat, and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] suggested Jo and Alex get married on the ferry, with Meredith officiating.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Jo visited her birth mother and found out the truth about her father, she fell into a depressive state. Alex stayed by her side, helping her at therapy. She hated the fact that she was another one of his crazy women, and said that they weren't even married, which gave him an out. However, Alex told her later that he didn't want an out. He wanted to marry her again. They got remarried on Halloween.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex disappeared to Iowa to visit his mother, Jo began to worry, as he wasn't responding to any of her texts or calls. He was supposedly dealing with something, but Jo worried that he was getting revenge for when she needed time, even though she knew he would never do that. While operating on a patient whose wife cheated on him, she started to think that maybe Alex was cheating on her. [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] told her that it had taken him and Teddy, like Jo and Alex, a long time to get where they were, and he wasn't going to screw that up for anything. He reassured her that Alex wouldn't, either.\n\nShe feared that he left her for good after calling his mom and finding out that Alex had never gone to Iowa. Shortly after that, she got a letter from him saying that he had reconnected with his ex-wife, Izzie (now a successful surgical oncologist) and had been living in Kansas with her and their two children, Alexis and Eli. He revealed that he had never fallen out of love with Izzie, and realized that her having their kids was everything he needed to go back to her. He told Jo that he would not be returning to Seattle and left her divorce papers.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Levi Schmitt]]\nJo had a one-night stand with Levi after he came to the bar to apologize to her.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nHe later returned her badge to her, which embarrassed her. When he came to her later about a potential donor he had found, she took the case from him, upsetting him.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nAfter finding out from [[Olivia Jankovic]] that [[Alex Karev|Alex]] had had syphilis in the past, he was worried he should get himself checked. Jo assured him she didn't have syphilis.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Levi came out as gay and after he broke up with Nico and Jo was left by Alex she invited Levi to move in with her.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> The two established a close friendship.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\n[[Atticus Lincoln]]\nLink and Jo have known each other since they were undergrads. They waited tables at Jimmy's Crab Shack together. They describe themselves as being like brother and sister. When a girlfriend of his broke up with him, he was distraught and Jo came by his place to spend time with him even though he wanted to be alone. She insisted on staying and did his laundry for him. Her company helped him through that rough patch and he returned the favor when she returned from meeting her mother.\n\n[[Stephanie Edwards]]\nJo and Stephanie had a strong friendship that developed throughout their residency, and were there for each other through their hardest times. Jo helped Stephanie get through [[April and Jackson's Wedding|Jackson leaving her for April]], and Stephanie helped Jo when Alex and Jo broke up. Jo was devastated when Stephanie quit her job after the hospital fire. She attempted to fill the hole Stephanie left with [[Ben Warren]].\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nWhen Meredith was publishing her abdominal wall transplant, she wanted to put Jo's name on the paper, but she also needed a picture, and Jo couldn't give a picture because then [[Paul Stadler|Paul]] would find her, so she asked Meredith to take her name off of the article. From that point on, Meredith was very protective of Jo and was even nice to her when [[Alex Karev|Alex]] asked. Then when Paul surprised Jo at the hospital, Meredith was there to comfort her and to keep her safe from Paul. She comforted her by saying \"You're Jo Wilson. I know exactly who you are.\" Meredith kept Alex from Paul, so Alex didn't kill him, and Meredith sat with Jo while she was signing the divorce papers. She also protected her when Paul came back and was threatening Jo for talking to Jenny, Meredith \"called security\" even though the phones weren't working. After that, when Meredith was dealing with the mini spleens in [[Judy Kemp]], Jo wished that a mini-spleen situation would happen for a useful organ, which gave Meredith the idea for her contest entry: mini livers. Since Jo helped find an important piece, she put Jo as her partner for the contest, and they created their mini livers together. After Jo's return to the hospital, Meredith has taken on a sisterly role to Jo, helping her out whenever she needs help.\n\n\nDr. Wilson graduated cum laude from Princeton University and [[Harvard Medical School]]. She obtained a spot at the most wanted [[Resident|residency-match]], [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital|Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's]] [[General Surgery|surgical program]].\n\nDr. Wilson was named by [[Meredith Grey]] as the most promising [[Internship|intern]] and was thus awarded the first surgery of the rotation, which is in fact given to interns they think will fail. As expected, she did fail to complete the surgery and while crying about it, [[Owen Hunt|Dr. Owen Hunt]] informed her that it was an exercise meant to be a learning experience. The surgery is \"designed\" for the chosen intern to fail to set an example for the other interns.\n\nWhen [[Richard Webber]] asked Meredith to choose one of the [[Resident|residents]] to assist with the surgery on him, Jo Wilson was selected.\n\nAfter assisting [[Callie Torres|Dr. Torres]] in a surgery, Jo was caught in the backlash as Callie was [[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word|sued for malpractice]].\n\nWhen a patient in the E.R. broke his arm due to a tetanic contraction, Jo scrubbed in with Callie on his fracture repair. She discovered a love of [[Orthopedic Surgery|ortho]] and has since been scrubbing in with Callie often.\n\nDuring Jo's fifth-year of residency, she has been chosen as [[Resident#Chief Resident|Chief Resident]]. Since Callie's departure, she has been showing an interest in [[General Surgery|general surgery]] and has been scrubbing in with Meredith often. Her interest in general surgery has also led her to closely work with Meredith in the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]].\n\nTowards the end of her fifth-year, [[Massachusetts General Hospital|MassGen]] offered Jo a minimally-invasive surgery fellowship. Meredith was also ready to offer her a general surgery [[Attending|attending]] position at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital|Grey Sloan]].<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref> Ultimately, she declined MassGen's offer and decided to stay in Seattle to become a Surgical Innovation Fellow. \n\nAfter her time at the psychiatric hospital, Jo returned to Grey Sloan and became an attending general surgeon.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref> She showed excellent skills in the absence of Meredith and became one of the highest-regarded general surgeons of the hospital. During the COVID- pandemic, Jo discovered the joy of [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] and began taking steps to change specialties. Because she received special dispensation from Chief [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey's]] recommendation due to already having completed a [[General Surgery|surgical residency]], she did not have to repeat the first intern year and is a second-year of her OB/GYN residency at the time of her transition.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\n*Jo once dressed up as Tinkerbell for Halloween.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n*Jo frequently used [[Heather Brooks|Heather's]] deodorant without telling her.\n*Jo believed her mother left her at a fire station at two weeks old, but her birth mother would later claim she dropped her off when she was five days old.\n*There is a timeline discrepancy regarding how long Jo's residency is, as she begins her fellowship in , six years after she began her internship. \n*She is allergic to wool.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n*As a teenager, Jo lived in her car.\n*Jo is very good at math.<ref>[[The Face of Change]], \ud</ref>\n*Her screensaver is a picture of the Catherine Fox Award.\n*She hates cats and beaches.<ref>[[I'm Winning]], x</ref>\n*Jo sends out her laundry.\n*She has some anger problems.\n*Jo has been in jail before, and fears that if she loses her job as a doctor she will end up there again.\n*She won $ from Alex after betting on Shane to win when he was playing ping pong with [[Derek Shepherd]] for his rehab.

At the mixer, she met Alex and the two of them left together. ''(\"[[Time Has Come Today]]\")''\n\n\nOlivia worked on the case of [[Digby Owens]]. She was the nurse instructed to move him to ICU after his infected calf tattoo was revealed. ''(\"[[The Self-Destruct Button]]\")''\n\n\nWhen George asked her out, she had been having a casual thing with [[Alex Karev]]. She broke it off, but not before she contracted syphilis, which she then passed on to George. ''(\"[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]]\")''\n\n\nOlivia called George into a patient's room to intubate her, not knowing that George had failed an intubation earlier that day. Despite his wariness, George stepped in and did the intubation successfully, impressing Olivia. George then asked her out on a date. ''(\"[[Save Me]]\")''\n\n\nOlivia was one of the nurses who contracted syphilis during the outbreak. She got it from Alex and passed it on to George. ''(\"[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]]\")''\n\n\nOlivia signed the get-well card for [[Joe]] after he was hospitalized due to his aneurysm. She wrote that they were rooting for him and couldn't wait to see him back at the bar. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\nAfter giving him syphilis, George had to work with Olivia attempting to resuscitate a patient he didn't believe could be saved. Things between them were awkward as they worked together. At the end of the day, he said that he just didn't like her enough, that he liked Meredith so much that he wouldn't care if she gave him Ebola. ''(\"[[Enough is Enough]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Olivia presented the case of [[Holden McKee]], informing the doctors that he needed to be examined before he could be sent back to his nursing home. ''(\"[[Thanks for the Memories]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Robert Martin was in the hospital, Olivia was one of his nurses. She was ordered to give him hypertonic saline to bring his sodium level up, but Alex gave her the wrong order, so she gave him too much, dehydrating Robert's brain. She later revealed this when Derek came to check on him as he had a seizure. ''(\"[[Much too Much]]\")''\n\n\nAfter treating Robert Martin together, Olivia found Alex in an on-call room. They talked about when they had been sleeping together before and Olivia assured him that the sex was good. They then had sex again, even though he was seeing Izzie. ''(\"[[Much too Much]]\")''\n\n\nOlivia was one of Carl's nurses. She tried to attach the leeches to start biological therapy, but she was nervous, so the leech wouldn't attach. ''(\"[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\")''\n\n\nOlivia was one of the nurses who went on strike. When George was reluctant to cross the picket line, Olivia came and said that he could cross and they wouldn't throw donuts. Because of his parents' union ties, he refused and ultimately ended up joining the picket line. Olivia, Tyler, and Debbie then asked George to cross the line and go in to check on their patients. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Tucker Jones]] was in a car accident, Olivia informed the doctors of the incoming rig before knowing who the patient was. ''(\"[[It's the End of the World]]\")''\n\n\nShe was one of the nurses who attended to [[Keith Polace]]. When his fianc\uee left him, she said that if the fianc\uee couldn't love him the way he loved her, it was better that she left. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Izzie cut his LVAD wire, Bailey told Olivia to take over pumping Denny's heart so that Izzie could leave with her. Izzie refused to let her take over, so Bailey instructed her to stay with Izzie and help her if she'd allow it. Bailey eventually got Izzie to hand it over to Olivia. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\nWhen Denny died, Olivia went to get the other interns because Izzie had crawled into bed with him and wouldn't leave. ''(\"[[Losing My Religion]]\")''\n\n\nOlivia was in the ER helping cover flu patients. When a premature infant that was found in a trashcan was brought in, [[Alex Karev|Alex]] immediately took him up to the NICU before admitting him, not wanting him exposed to influenza. Olivia fruitlessly objected. She later informed Addison when four girls arrived, each of whom was possibly the mother of the baby. ''(\"[[Time Has Come Today]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Burke was in the hospital, Olivia was one of his nurses. Cristina bribed her to ask Burke if he'd had any tremors, but he figured out what she was doing and wouldn't tell her. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day the clinic opened, Olivia taught the interns the protocol for the flu vaccine. ''(\"[[Wishin' and Hopin']]\")''\n\n\nWhen George started to feel ill, he passed [[Marina Rose Wagner|Marina Wagner's]] blood off to Olivia to take to the lab for testing. However, she later ended up in the clinic when the blood turned out to be toxic. ''(\"[[Wishin' and Hopin']]\")''\n\n\nWhen Ellis became agitated, Olivia gave her lorazepam to calm her down. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nOlivia and [[Nurse Jolene|Jolene]] informed [[Mark Sloan]] that the nurses had created a club to unite against him due to the fact he never called back after he slept with them. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger was announced, Olivia asked Alex to let her know if he heard anything, because the nurses were likely to be among the first cuts. She ultimately was fired to reduce staff in preparation for the merger. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhile back in Seattle visiting her parents, her son, Milo, swallowed a chew toy, which became stuck in his bronchus. She took him to the Grey Sloan Memorial ER, where they located the toy and used bronchoscopy to remove it. While she was at the hospital, she warned Jo about Alex's history, but once she realized he really had changed, she told Alex Jo was too good for him, which he already knew. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] was going through a dry spell, [[Cristina Yang]] encouraged George to ask Olivia out. After sleeping with George, Olivia gave him syphillis, an illness that she had contracted from a previous sexual encounter with [[Alex Karev|Alex]].\n\nGeorge soon broke up with Olivia because of a romantic interest in [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]]. After a minor argument, Olivia and George stayed friends.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nOlivia and Alex met at the intern mixer and went home together that night. ''(\"[[Time Has Come Today]]\")''\n\nAt some point, Alex transmitted syphilis to Olivia, who then passed it on to George. ''(\"[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]]\")''\n\nAfter Alex began a relationship with Izzie, Izzie caught him cheating on her with Olivia. ''(\"[[Much too Much]]\")''\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nShe was part of the 'Nurses United Against Mark Sloan' group, which implies she had had sexual relations with him. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\nHusband\nAfter moving from Seattle to Sacramento, California when she was fired, she met and married a man whom she says is kind, intelligent, and faithful. They had a son, Milo, together. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\n\nParents\nBoth her parents are still alive and they reside in Seattle. Her father likes talking politics.\n\n[[Milo Jankovic]]\nOlivia and her husband have a son together. He swallowed a chew toy while they were visiting her parents in Seattle because his grandfather started talking politics over dinner.\n\n\nStarting in , Olivia Harper was a nurse at Seattle Grace for seven years. She was one of the nurses who took part in the nurse strike.\n\nShe continued to work at Seattle Grace Hospital, but after news of the Seattle Grace and Mercy West merger, Olivia asked Alex to tell her if he found out anything. She believed that \"nurses are last to know and first to go\". Unfortunately, she was cut later that day. Derek offered her a letter of recommendation. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\nShe moved to Sacramento and found work there.

I'm doing this alone.|'''Sloan''' talking to '''[[Mark Sloan|Mark]]''' about her baby.}}\n\n'''Sloan Riley''' is the daughter of [[Mark Sloan]].\n\n\n\nWhen she was  years old, Sloan became pregnant. Her mother was very angry with her and kicked her out of the house. Sloan then decided to fly to Seattle to meet her biological father, as he was the only person she could go to. At first, she kept her pregnancy a secret from him and Lexie, but when she felt that they were about to kick her out of their apartment as well, she revealed her secret. Mark then decided to let Sloan stay with him and Lexie. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Lexie did an ultrasound, she found out there was something wrong with Sloan's baby. He had bands of amniotic tissue around his legs. She thought she was wrong at first and took Sloan to OB where\ua[[Elizabeth Chen]]\uaagreed with her that something was wrong. She also informed Sloan that her baby was a male.\uaMark was so worried about his daughter and grandson that he immediately flew Addison to Seattle.\n\nArizona was called in as well, giving Sloan two options. She could either let Addison operate on her baby in utero, or she could wait, give birth, and let Arizona fix the problem after having given birth, rehabbing the remaining part of his leg and fitting him with prosthetics. Together with Mark, Sloan decided to let Addison operate on her. However, during surgery, Addison revealed to Mark she would have to go in the womb between two engorged uterine arteries, which was very difficult.\uaMark forced Addison to stop the surgery right away, as he was too worried something could go wrong. After surgery, Sloan was worried about the baby not having a leg, so Lexie suggested that they fly to Los Angeles to let Addison operate again and finish the surgery. ''(\"[[Blink]]\")''\n\n\nLexie persuaded them to fly to Los Angeles to let Addison finish the surgery.\n\nWhen Sloan's blood pressure went up rapidly, Pete used acupuncture to get it back down. While Addison was operating, the AVM blew, but Addison opened and was able to save her and the baby. When she woke up, Sloan asked of her mother. Saying she wanted her life back and didn't want a baby. Addison talked to Sloan about adoption. ''(\"[[Another Second Chance]]\")''\n\n\nSloan returned to Seattle after she recovered from her surgery. She came to the hospital in order to get an ultrasound. She asked for an official form declaring the baby healthy, which she needed because she planned to give him up for adoption. [[Callie Torres]] gave her the form, but insisted that Sloan tell Mark about the adoption. He was upset and convinced her to keep the baby and give the baby to him to raise. She agreed, but later left without telling him, telling Callie she needed him to be someone else's baby. ''(\"[[Valentine's Day Massacre]]\")''\n\n\nSloan came back to Mark's apartment late at night in labor. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\")''\n\nShe delivered the baby with the help of [[Teddy Altman]]. The baby made no sounds initially, but started to cry after being stimulated by [[Arizona Robbins]]. They were then taken to the hospital, where Sloan was shocked to learn that she'd only be there for one day. She had purchased several small trinkets for the baby, many of which were choking hazards. She gave Mark the number to call [[Trish]] and [[Keith (Hook, Line and Sinner)|Keith]], the parents she'd chosen. When he hesitated, Arizona offered to make the call, but Mark said he could handle it. Sloan wondered where she'd go after she was discharged, so Mark offered to let her stay with him. She then suggested that maybe they keep the baby. Arizona tried to convince Mark to call the parents Sloan had picked, but he refused. However, when Sloan struggled to feed the baby, even with their help, Callie talked to Mark and reminded him that she was young and her instincts had led her to put the baby up for adoption. Mark called Sloan's mother and said she was coming to get Sloan and missed her. He told her that if ''she'' decided she wanted to keep the baby, he was all in, but not to keep the baby because of him because she'll always have him no matter what. ''(\"[[Hook, Line and Sinner]]\")''\n\n\nShe is described as intensely vapid and rude. She even went so far as to call her own father an old perv.\n\n\n\nMark Sloan is her father. He had a relationship with her mother, Samantha, when they were young. Samantha got pregnant and Mark gave her some money and assumed she used it to have an abortion, so he was shocked when Sloan showed up  years later looking for him. She looked for him because Samantha had kicked her out when she found out Sloan was pregnant.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Holidaze]]\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Blink]]\nPPSloanRiley.png|[[Another Second Chance]]\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Valentine's Day Massacre]]\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Hook, Line and Sinner]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg  \nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Sloan Riley Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Sloan Riley]]\n[[fr:Sloan Riley]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riley, Sloan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (CAM)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

And it's not always in our hands.|'''[[Derek Shepherd]]'''}}\n\n'''Derek Shepherd''' was a renowned [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]], and board director at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He was married to [[Meredith Grey]] and they have two daughters, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] and [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], and a son, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]]. He died from his injuries after being hit by a truck.\n\n\n\nDerek spent most of his life prior to his arrival in Seattle in New York City. Derek and his sisters attended a French Preschool. As a child, Derek had no hair products, so he had a large afro, acne, a weight of  pounds, and played the saxophone in the school band. He was raised by a single parent, his mother Carolyn, along with his four sisters: Nancy, Kathleen, Liz, and Amelia. Like Derek, all four of his sisters are doctors. His father owned a shop when he was younger, and one day two robbers approached him and demanded that he give up the watch his wife Carolyn had saved tirelessly to buy for him. When he refused, the robbers shot him to death, with Derek and his younger sister Amelia bearing witness to his death while hiding in the back of the store. This event forms a large part of Derek's moral compass and consequently may have inspired him to become a surgeon to help save lives. As a result, he is especially cynical when treating criminals and feels that they do not deserve any compassion from him.\n\nWhile in high school, Derek played hockey. One day, he pushed his friend into the wall and his friend got hurt, but got up and continued to play. It wasn't until the next day that he found out that he developed a brain bleed. He was left in a vegetative state for the rest of his life. Every month, Derek sent money to his friend's mother to help pay for his long-term care.\n\nDerek's childhood best friend was [[Mark Sloan]], who came from a wealthier but emotionally deficient background and was like a second son to the Shepherd family.\n\nDerek used to ride a motorcycle, but after an accident that gave him a scar, he stopped doing so.\n\nDerek went to [[Bowdoin College]] in Maine for his undergraduate years. He then attended [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] with [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] and [[Mark Sloan|Mark]]. During his medical education, Derek was taught by Richard Webber.\n\n\nAfter Addison cheated on him with Mark, Derek left his private practice in New York and accepted Richard Webber's offer to come work for him at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] with the possibility of becoming the Chief once Webber retired. Derek became aware that Burke was in the running too after he was hired. His sudden move to Seattle made him a curiosity to the other doctors as he gave up a well-established and respected practice in New York.\n\n\nWhile Richard was getting treatment for his alcoholism, Derek became Chief of Surgery. The job required more paperwork and less surgery than he thought, and after being in the shooting he was very cautious and didn't want that responsibility, which led to his resignation.\n\n\nGary Clark was a grieving widower whose wife was taken off of life support. He blamed the doctors who had taken her off of life support. He attempted a lawsuit against the hospital but had no case. Still grieving heavily, he went on a shooting spree at Seattle Grace Mercy West. He killed Dr. Charles Percy, Nurse Vivian, Dr. Reed Adamson, and  other people, including  security guards. He also shot Alex Karev, Owen Hunt, and Derek Shepherd, along with four others who were injured, but not killed. The stress of witnessing his shooting caused Meredith to miscarry. Derek coped with the traumatic experience by speeding. He was arrested multiple times for speeding, which led to Meredith leaving him in jail overnight. He quit his job as Chief of Surgery, having intended to do so for some time as he realized he preferred to be in the O.R. instead of doing administrative work. He told the psychologist Dr. Andrew Perkins that the shooting gave him the courage to step down and quit. After getting arrested prior to Cristina and Owen's wedding, Meredith told him about her miscarriage and begged him to stop making her worry about his speeding.\n\n\nInspired by Meredith's mother's disease, Derek decided to try and find a way to cure Alzheimer's. He initially selected Alex to work with him on the trial, but Alex couldn't handle how depressing it was, so Derek asked Meredith to work with him instead. When Richard started to get worried about Adele's mental condition (he knew she had Alzheimer's), he asked Derek to have her put into the trial. She did not get into the trial because her Alzheimer's has not progressed far enough yet, which was shown by testing. Eventually, she did get put into the trial because of her rapidly progressing disease. Meredith switched the envelopes to make sure Adele got the active agent and not the placebo and in doing so she tainted the trial. Meredith would have been punished for her actions, but Richard stepped in and took the blame, knowing that she only did what she did because she wanted to help Adele. The trial data was sent to another doctor to continue the work and Derek was blacklisted by the FDA.\n\n\nDerek came to Seattle with a reputation as a gifted surgeon who had a penchant for taking on \"hopeless\" cases and highly complex procedures that are often passed on by his peers. After being blacklisted by the FDA for the Alzheimer's trial incident, Derek resumed taking on impossible cases. He took Lexie under his wing and they worked on those cases together.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Derek's hand after the plane crash]]\nAfter having to smash his left hand with a rock to free it from plane wreckage, Derek's hand was severely injured. Many bones were broken and there was significant nerve damage. Callie was able to fix his hand, with the help of the donation of a nerve from the leg of Derek's sister [[Liz Shepherd|Liz]]. This was a very long fight for Derek. He thought he would never operate again and resulted in teaching the interns in the skills lab.\n\n\nNot much time after promising Meredith to take a step back to take care of the kids so she could shine, Derek teamed up with Callie to create robotic limbs that could move through mind control. Derek developed special sensors that had to be inserted in the skull in order for the robotic limbs to work. Upon Owen's request, Derek sat down with guys from the President's brain mapping initiative as they expressed interest in using his sensors for their project too. On top of denying them the rights to his sensors, Derek told them they were approaching their project all wrong and set them in the right direction. Later that day, Derek was called by the President, who asked him to join his brain mapping initiative.\n\nDerek accepted the offer and started working with his new colleagues from his office at Grey Sloan Memorial. He kept contact through video calls. He was shown to be of great value to their project when they bent the rules when he stated he'd quit if they wouldn't let Callie continue to use the sensors too. Initially, Meredith resented the fact that he didn't keep his promise to take a step back, as now she had to take a step back to take care of the kids. As he became more and more important, occasional business trips to Washington D.C. were required. Luckily for him and Meredith, his sister Amelia decided to stay in Seattle, thus being able to take over his service, so that he could brain map to his heart's content, and help them take care of the kids, giving Meredith the time she needed for her career. When Derek returned from one of the trips to D.C., he had met the President, who was so interested that he wanted to make the meeting a weekly thing. He offered Derek a permanent position at the NIH and an attending position for Meredith at James Madison Hospital, so Derek could do the actual brain mapping work himself.\n\nMeredith initially wanted to join Derek, but Cristina told her that even though Derek is dreamy, Meredith is the sun, not him. Meredith then decided to stay in Seattle as that's where she grew up and started her family, and she didn't want to be a trailing spouse like her father was to her mother. Derek didn't really understand why, as there'd be nothing she couldn't do in D.C. that she would be able to do in Seattle. However, he decided that Meredith and the kids were more important to him and he turned down the job, even though Meredith didn't ask him to.\n\nThis rendered him bitter and angry all the time, as Meredith wasn't happy with his choice, never showing that she was supportive of his decision. He pressured Meredith to make the most of her career to make up for the sacrifice he made, which she soon grew tired off. During a heated argument, he compared her to her cold mother, resulting in a radio silence between the two. He also constantly butted heads with Amelia, who took over his job as Head of Neurosurgery. He tried to get his old job back but later apologized for that. She understood that he gave up a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but didn't think that was reason enough to take out his anger on the people around him.\n\nMeredith and Derek only managed to speak to each other in \"time-outs\" regarding Maggie, whom they discovered to be Meredith's half-sister. He threw a dinner party, but he and Meredith got too wrapped up in a sexual encounter after months of denying him sex to make it in time. While he started to keep himself under control at home, he still had difficulties at work. When a woman spilled Amelia's secrets about her drug abuse history in the hospital, he simply took her case when the woman requested another doctor for her parents rather than supporting his sister and defending her. In the evening, he admitted to Amelia that he lost himself, not recognizing himself anymore. He wanted to do right by everyone around him, but he only ended up hurting them. He was angry and miserable all the time and didn't know what to do with himself anymore. Amelia said that that feeling is what they call rock bottom.\n\nDerek later butted heads with Meredith over a case. She suspected that he did that because of their latest fights. He acknowledged to Richard that she had every reason to think that, but he assured him that it wasn't the case. They both recognized Ellis in Meredith, this time in the sense of the ambitious surgeon. Throughout the day, a personal assistant of the President's came back to Seattle to offer him the job again, but he refused again. The situation resulted in his biggest fight with Meredith just yet, with him stating he was done compromising himself for her. She replied he did, making her feel his pissiness and resentment all day. He explained that was because she never showed support for his decision, instead trying to prove all the time that he made the wrong decision. His recent behaviors made it clear for her that she had proven it, as he couldn't be happy anymore, diminishing everyone around him. \"I gave up everything!\" he yelled, once again expressing how important the brain mapping initiative was for him. Meredith pointed out that he was the only one keeping him down, as she never asked him to stay, and stated he should've gone do D.C., which he replied was still an option. He took his phone and called the President's assistant, this time accepting the job. He assured Meredith he was really going to leave and walked off to pack his stuff.\n\n\nDerek went to the airport, and right before boarding the plane, he had a phone call with Meredith. They agreed to stop fighting and try to make it work, as neither of them wanted their relationship to end. He went to D.C. and started leading the Brain Mapping Initiative, aided by research fellows. He took an interest in a side project of one of these fellows, [[Renee Collier]], and encouraged her when she felt stuck, eventually even starting to help out with her research. Renee started to develop a romantic interest in him, which ultimately resulted in a kiss between the two. Derek stopped it, saying he loved his wife and didn't want anything else than what he had with her. He quickly left the lab to board a plane to Seattle to go see his wife, forgetting his phone and keys in the lab. At that time, Meredith called him to talk about her day, and Renee picked up the phone, thinking it was Derek calling with another phone. Renee didn't know what to say after answering and hung up, leaving Meredith to think that Derek was cheating on her. Once Meredith and Derek talked, Derek told Meredith he couldn\ut live without her. Meredith said she could live without him but she didn\ut ever want to. The two then hugged and made up. A couple of days after Meredith and Derek were in bed and Derek said that she has always been the one and that Meredith truly did save him. Meredith and Derek then conceived their third child.\n\n\n[[File:Meredithsayinggoodbyetoderek.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith says her last goodbye to Derek.]]\nNot long after his return home, Derek was on his way to the airport for one last trip to D.C. when he witnessed a car crash on a remote road. He immediately leaped into action, saving four people from the wreckage before the emergency officials arrived to take the patients to Dillard Medical Center. Derek returned to his car and began to pull out to turn around when his phone suddenly rang. Leaving the car sideways in the middle of the road, he began reaching for the phone, not noticing an approaching semi, which crashed into the side of his car. Derek was then taken to Dillard where the doctors began examining him. Conscious but unable to speak, he knew that he needed a head CT, and begged in his mind for the doctors to also realize this; one of them, [[Penelope Blake]], quickly did and lobbied to get the CT, but to no avail, as she was repeatedly shut down by her superior, [[Paul Castello]], who believed that Derek's abdominal bleeding was more pressing, even though he was stable enough to get the CT. Derek was rushed to the OR, but by the time the doctors figured out what was going on and managed to bring in a neurosurgeon (whom they had to wait for over an hour after paging him), it was already too late and Derek was pronounced brain dead. Not long after, Meredith, whom the police have brought to the hospital, signed the papers to take him off life-support. She then sat with him as he died, holding his chest and telling him \"You can go\" as he let out his last breath. Interestingly, he continued to narrate in his mind up to almost the very end, even after losing consciousness (and possibly all brain function) -- at one point saying to the attending physicians \"It's too late.\" \"You're too late.\" We are left with the feeling that at some point an ethereal consciousness had taken over where his physical brain was no longer capable.<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nFuneral\nAt Derek\us funeral, it is shown that Cristina is holding Meredith\us hand.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nTired Meredith\nMeredith imagined Derek being with her after completing a long surgery while already being exhausted. She also thought about him as something good to get herself through the surgery.<ref>[[The Room Where It Happens]], x</ref>\n\nDay of the Dead\nDerek was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nInside Meredith's Visions\nWhen Meredith was diagnosed with COVID-, she began to slip in and out of consciousness, often waking up on a beach. Far away on that same beach, Derek stood there, waving and calling her name. Countless times Meredith wanted to come closer to him, walking only to appear back in the same spot. Derek then claimed that the sand \"wasn't real\", and it wouldn't make a difference if he tried walking towards her, much to Meredith's dedication to get to him.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref><ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>Afterwards, they got closer and closer to each other and began to talk about their kids, their family and his death. They had a wedding on the beach and both agreed that Meredith needed to come back because the kids needed her. Derek told her it was not her time yet so she needed to go, although she said there was no pain on the beach. Derek sniffed her hair and hugged her while hearing Zola's voice. Meredith then woke up with Zola by her side and Derek walked away from the beach.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlthough he was sometimes annoyed by his overbearing mother and sisters, he was nonetheless aware of their closeness and had no doubt that all four of his \"very girly\" sisters would be at his bedside if he were ever hurt or sick. He said that he chose surgery as his specialty for the quiet escape and solace of the O.R. His profound hurt over Mark\us affair with Addison back in New York is compounded by his view of Mark as his brother, the one constant male influence in his life since the death of his father as a child. Probably due to his own background and experience of growing up in a large, happy family, he was much more open to meeting Meredith's \"long lost\" half-sisters than she was. He had to encourage her to accept [[Lexie Grey]] and [[Maggie Pierce]] into her life. He took Lexie under his wing and she saw him as the \"big brother\" she never had.\n\nContrary to the lifestyle his salary entitled him to, Derek preferred the simple life and lived in a [[Derek's Trailer|trailer]], much to Addison's horror and everyone else's bemusement, prior to moving in with Meredith. He tried to eat healthy despite his hectic schedule and irregular hours and enjoyed being in nature, especially fishing.\n\nIn contrast to the easy-going Mark, Derek tended to brood. After working on [[Jen Harmon]], who died on his OR table, he spent several weeks hiding out in his trailer. He also tends to hold grudges, as shown when he brought up Addison's affair in a heated argument with Mark and the fact that he still has lingering anger over his father's murder.\n\nDerek tended to have high and exacting standards, sometimes yelling at interns and residents for not meeting them. Although charismatic, his reputation has been known to intimidate the newcomers. However, he was also liked by interns and residents due to his willingness to teach and allow them hands-on experience in his surgeries. He disliked the competitive \"dog eat dog\" attitude displayed by some of the residents and has been known to threaten severe consequences or throw out residents and interns who try to get in on his surgeries through such means.\n\nAt Seattle Grace, he managed to stay friends with Addison, even after their divorce, and was friends with Preston Burke, but was left without friends when they both left [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. He was broken up with Meredith, Bailey didn't want to have a drink with him, and the Chief said he didn't drink. With nobody to talk to, Derek started to talk to Mark again, and they slowly began to rebuild their friendship and soon enough became best friends again. After getting back together with Meredith, he became friends with her housemates and friends, primarily Cristina, Alex, Izzie, and George. They were initially antagonistic towards him as they thought Meredith was sleeping with him to get into the OR, but they quickly accepted him after getting to know him. Derek befriended [[Owen Hunt]] due to his relationship with Cristina, Meredith's \"dark and twisted sister\". After a rocky start to their working relationship, they shared a mutual respect for one another and sometimes hung out with Mark, especially when they have \"girl problems\".\n\nWhen Richard began slipping back into the state of a severe alcoholic, Derek was adamant about Richard seeking treatment for his condition, even if it meant jeopardizing Richard's career in the process. When the hospital board learned that he'd begun drinking again, they presented to him the option of retiring. Derek, on the other hand, stood by the plan that Richard enter a rehab program, sober up, and return to his position as [[Chief of Surgery]]. While still in denial of his predicament, Richard accuses Derek of forcing his problems out into the open so he could get his hands on the position as Chief. While Derek admitted that he did want the job, he still stood by the plan of Richard entering rehab so that Richard could eventually return as Chief. In Richard's absence as chief, Derek assumed the role temporarily.\n\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nDerek married his medical school girlfriend, [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Montgomery]] in , and the two began their residencies, studying under Dr. Richard Webber. Following residencies and fellowships, Derek and Addison quickly became very successful in their respective fields. They appeared to lead an affluent lifestyle, owning both a Manhattan brownstone overlooking Central Park and a home in the Hamptons, as well as running their own private practices. However, their success and busy workloads put a strain on their marriage, and the two grew apart; the emotional distance eventually drove Addison to cheat on Derek with his best friend, [[Mark Sloan]]. Derek himself admitted that he was never around. After discovering Addison in bed with Mark, Derek declared the marriage over and relocated from a private practice to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], accepting a job offer from his former teacher, Dr. Richard Webber, as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Neurosurgery at Seattle Grace Hospital and trading in the brownstone for an Airstream trailer on  acres of rural property on Vashon Island.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[Image:der-mer-sex.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek met his wife, Meredith, waking up after their first encounter.]]\nSoon after arriving in Seattle, Derek met his future wife [[Meredith Grey]] at a bar and went home with her for a one-night stand, only to discover the next day that she was a new surgical intern at the hospital. Although she initially rejected his advances as inappropriate due to their working relationship, Meredith eventually agreed to date Derek, although he failed to tell her about his marriage. His charismatic, charming personality and good looks earned him the nickname \ucMcDreamy\ud among Meredith and her friends. However, their fledgling relationship came to a sudden halt when Addison arrived in Seattle for a consult upon Richard Webber's request.  Addison had also brought divorce papers but made it clear that if Derek was willing to give her a second chance, she wanted to give their marriage another try. Derek struggled over his choice, but ultimately, his sense of obligation to his marriage vows won, and he left Meredith to return to his wife.\n\n[[Image:Candles.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek and Meredith's house of candles.]]\nAfter a -day vacation, Meredith and Derek saw each other for the first time since [[Preston Burke|Burke]] and [[Cristina Yang|Cristina's]] wedding and they both met Meredith's half-sister, Lexie. Later, Derek pulled Meredith aside to ask if their relationship was over, and she said it was. However, they ended up kissing and having \"break-up sex.\" They later said that their relationship consisted of S&M (sex and mockery) only. Derek, thinking about his addiction to having sex with Meredith, told her that he wanted more; he wanted to marry her and have kids with her, to build them a house and have them settle down and grow old together. He wanted to die in her arms when he was  and he wanted them to have a lifetime.&nbsp;Meredith, as she was, said she needed time and walked away, but they continued to have sex. Throughout this, Cristina helped Meredith with her relationship and tried to help her find out what she wanted. \n\nMeredith asked him to live with her, which he agreed to, saying she was flighty like a deer and that they would take baby steps, showing he would show her all the patience she needed. He wanted to force Alex and Izzie to move out, but Meredith didn't, telling him they were her family. However, he said they could stay and that, once again, he would wait until she was ready. When he discovered her mother's diary, he had a conversation with Mark, where his friend asked him about the trailer. He answered that he was more likely to be kicked out by the end of the week, so he keeps the trailer, but she wanted him to stay, so he lends her his trailer so she can read the diary with Cristina, stating that she needs a place where she can be alone.\n\n[[Sydney Heron]]\nAlthough Derek and Sydney were physically close, they weren't yet emotionally close or in an actual relationship. After Derek went on a pity date with [[Sydney Heron]], Meredith was concerned about him dating other women, so she announced to him that she didn't want him to see other women, and even if she wasn't enough for him right now, she was trying and was scared that she would lose him.\n\n[[Rose]]\nShe told him not to say anything yet, so he was unable to tell Meredith that he had just kissed [[Rose]], a nurse who he'd been getting to know and flirting with over the last few days. When Meredith discovered that he had kissed Rose, their relationship ended.\n\nDerek began to date Rose and Meredith entered into therapy with [[Katharine Wyatt|Dr. Wyatt]]. While Derek appeared to be happy in his relationship with Rose, it was clear to those close to him, namely Mark and Addison, that he wasn't. Derek delayed sleeping with Rose and after finally doing so, he admitted to Mark that he had been thinking of Meredith the entire time. Everything finally came to a head when his and Meredith's clinical trial finally saved a life. He tried to find her to celebrate the good news and eventually located her on his land. She had built a house of candles and told him that she was now \"all whole and healed\" and that while she hadn't forgiven him, she wanted them to be \"extraordinary together rather than ordinary apart.\" They kissed before he left to break up with Rose. Rose was angry at him over the break-up, accidentally stabbing him once with a scalpel in the middle of a surgery, which led her to transfer departments.\n\n\nFamily is something that is very important to Derek. His decision to work on his marriage was based largely on his sense of obligation to Addison as his family, the woman with whom he shared \"eleven birthdays, eleven Thanksgivings, and eleven Christmases.\" The choice was not as simple as Derek had anticipated, and he found that he still had very strong feelings for Meredith, even as he tried to repair his marriage to Addison. Shortly before Christmas, he confessed to Addison that Meredith had not just been a fling, but that he'd fallen in love with her; Addison was willing to wait it out, although the situation was complicated further when she and Derek took in Meredith's dog, Doc. Although Derek eventually admitted that the problems in their marriage were partially his fault, his love for Meredith continued to make him emotionally distant from Addison.\n\nWhen Meredith began dating Finn Dandridge, Doc's veterinarian, Derek became so withdrawn and consumed with jealousy that Addison confronted Derek about his ongoing infatuation with Meredith, and even asked Meredith if she was sleeping with Derek. At a hospital-sponsored prom for the chief's dying niece, Derek and Meredith's emotional affair reached the point of no return. After a heated argument in an exam room, Derek and Meredith had sex, but before they could discuss the implications of their actions, Meredith was called away to deal with Izzie, whose fianc\ue had just died. The next day, Addison found Meredith\us panties, which had been left in Derek's tuxedo jacket, and pinned them to the hospital bulletin board, while Derek went to Meredith's house and professed his love to her for the first time. Their reunion, however, was not immediate.\n\nInitially, Derek felt immense guilt over the breakdown of his marriage with Addison and went to the hotel room where she was staying to apologize. Instead, he was appalled to find out that Addison, in a drunken stupor, had called Mark in New York to fly to Seattle for a \"trans-continental booty call.\" To Derek's disdain, Mark decided to take up a position at Seattle Grace in a bid to woo Addison back.  Although he and Addison acknowledged the end of their marriage and began divorce proceedings, Meredith was less certain and decided to date both Derek and Finn before making a decision between the two. While they were dating, Meredith was admitted for an appendectomy, and Finn's concern for her during her illness led Derek to reconsider his pursuit of her. As she recovered from surgery, he told Meredith that he was walking away, freeing her to be with Finn, whom he considered \"the better guy.\" Meredith, however, had already decided that Derek was \"the one\" for her, and broke up with Finn. She kept the break-up from Derek for another week and made the unfortunate timing mistake of telling him just after Addison had confessed that she and Mark had not just been a one-night stand, as she had led Derek to believe, but had actually lived together for two months after Derek left for Seattle.\n\n[[Nancy Shepherd]]\nMeredith's introduction to Derek's family was no less problematic; she stopped by the trailer one night to talk to Derek and discovered a strange woman lying across Derek's bed and Derek, wearing nothing more than a towel and a very startled expression. She would later learn that the woman was Derek\us sister, Nancy, but the explanation of the misunderstanding did not make Meredith any more appealing to Nancy, who continuously referred to Meredith as the \"slutty intern.\" Derek defended Meredith, leading Nancy to acknowledge Derek's feelings for her, but Nancy encouraged her brother to take some time to figure out what he wanted rather than worrying about the women in his life.\n\nFollowing Nancy's advice, Derek asked Meredith for time to take some space for himself and then embarked on a very brief camping trip, which only cemented his desire for Meredith. He found her in the very place they had first met\uJoe's bar\uand they agreed to start their relationship over from the very beginning. While their newly resumed relationship was happy, to begin with, Derek and Meredith began to grow distant after she almost drowned. As the distance between them grew, Derek was tempted to accept a drink from a woman he met at Joe's during Burke's bachelor party, but ultimately refused. The next day, he admitted meeting the woman (who unbeknown to both, was Meredith's half-sister Lexie) to Meredith and confronted her over her level of commitment to their relationship. He told her she was the love of his life but asked that she end the relationship if she was not equally committed. Meredith did not address the issue and instead focused her energies on Cristina's wedding, leaving her relationship with Derek uncertain. After Burke left Cristina at the altar, Meredith made an announcement to the guests that seemed to imply she had given up on her relationship with Derek as well: \"It's over\uso over.\" When Meredith asked her intern to call all four of Derek's sisters to ask for a donor nerve, it is revealed that Nancy still refuses to speak to her and hung up on her.\n\n[[Liz Shepherd]]\nLiz is Derek's younger sister. She donated nerves from her legs for Derek\us hand surgery after the plane crash. Even though Derek initially didn\ut want her to help, he eventually let her.\n\n[[Kathleen Shepherd]]\nKathleen is Derek's older sister. Not much is known about their relationship.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAmelia is Derek's youngest sister. When she was younger, she stole her brother's prescription pad and overdosed. When Derek found her, she was out cold. He performed CPR for a while until an ambulance arrived. She was clinically dead for  whole minutes but was able to be resuscitated. From then on the siblings drifted apart and became estranged.\n\nWhen Derek got shot, Amelia went to Seattle to see him in hopes to restart their relationship. He didn't want her there and made comments on her past with drugs, but before she left for LA again, he talked to her on the hospital parking lot. For the first time, they talked about their father's death and the memories they shared. Derek said that he couldn't call her and tell her he was hurt because ever since their father had died, he had sworn to protect her. He didn't want her to know that pain even exists. They reconnected and their relationship was better ever since.\n\nAmelia visited for a second time when she wanted him to help her with the brain tumor of [[Mason Warner|Mason's]] [[Erica Warner|mother]], that was killing her. It was shortly after she got out of rehab again, so Derek told her she should give up on that impossible task because she was too fragile. Amelia didn't listen and practiced with [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] to perform the surgery fast enough to not kill Erica right on the table. Finally, Derek gave in and agreed to help her because he was sure she would never give up. They later successfully performed the surgery and further bonded over the experience of giving a young boy his mother back.\n\nShortly before Cristina left, Amelia came once again to see her brother in Seattle, announcing she was now engaged to [[James Peterson|James]]. She decided to stay for a while, sometimes scrubbing in with Derek. She was seen having arguments with her fianc\ue and it turned out she wanted to stay permanently. Amelia became head of neurosurgery, taking Derek's job because he wanted to leave for Washington anyway. Before he actually left, they fought a lot in the OR, both not dealing well with the reversed situation of her being his boss. It even came down to him being unclear to Owen about her drug history, so that she almost got fired. He apologized, admitting he wanted his job back.\n\nWhen he eventually returned from DC, he didn't fight his little sister anymore. Derek was okay with taking her orders but Amelia was still suspicious, as she was convinced he wanted his old job back. Their relationship was better than ever despite him only being \"second place.\ud\n\nOne night, they had a conversation about their father again, as they had lost two men who were shot that day. Derek checked on Amelia to make sure she was okay. They sat down and talked about things, her eventually admitting that she was falling in love with Owen. And that she was scared. He reassured her and was totally okay with the idea of her and Owen.\n\nOn the car on his way to DC, before he had the accident, Derek had a call with Amelia. She was doing surgery on a car crash victim with April and Bailey and they talked about him not making it to his flight. The reception got bad and the last thing he said to her was \"Amy, are you there?\" It would be the last thing Amelia would ever hear her brother say as he died shortly after.\n\nShe struggled in the aftermath of Derek's death and would crack morbid jokes about him. Her grudge against [[Penelope Blake|Dr. Penelope Blake]] over her brother's wrongful death drew a wedge between her and her sister-in-law. Meredith wanted to move on and teach Dr. Blake to learn from her mistakes, while Amelia was still vengeful and mistreated her.\n\n[[Carolyn Shepherd]]\nHis mother came to see him and meet Meredith. To begin with, Meredith was nervous and attempted to be the bubbly happy 'Izzie-like' girl that mothers love, including a high ponytail complete with a scrunchie. However, after talking with the true Meredith for only a short while, she told Derek that she was the \"good one\" and gave him the ring his father wanted him to have for the \"one.\ud After accepting the ring, he began to plan a proposal to Meredith but worried that she still might not be ready. But when she mentioned their own future children in passing, he knew that she was ready for marriage. He told Mark he was going to propose, who told Richard Webber, Owen Hunt, and Callie Torres, but kept it secret from Meredith. Everyone suggested a grand proposal so he planned an elaborate one involving roses and a giant teddy bear. However, an emergency call from Addison meant he had to abandon the proposal. After the death of [[Jen Harmon]] (a death he blamed himself for) and learning that he had lost more patients than those he had saved, he became depressed and returned to his trailer after lounging on the couch for several days. He began to drink a large amount and refused to return to work.\n\nRichard informed Meredith about Derek's intention to propose and the ring leading to her going to confront Derek at the trailer. He pushed her away saying that she is \"a lemon\" and that she has just been waiting to get him out of the house. She tells him that she knows about the ring and he shows it to her before batting it into the woods and telling her to go. After being chastised by Richard, Meredith went to see Derek again. Derek asks her whether she would still love him if he wasn't a doctor. Meredith answers no, explaining that Izzie has cancer that has spread to her brain and he is one of only  people in the world who could save her. She couldn't love him if he wouldn't help her. Derek returned to the house and attempted to propose to Meredith but she refused him. He started work again, operating on Izzie. Just before the surgery, Meredith showed up with his ferryboat scrub cap and he asked her to marry him again but she turned him down.\n\nAt the end of her shift, she was waiting for an elevator. After being guided by the chief to the right one, she found a clean-shaven Derek waiting for her. The elevator was decorated with scans of all the surgeries they did together. He recounted the stages of their relationships as they played out during each case. Lastly, he showed her the post-op scans of the different lives they have saved over the years, and, of course, Izzie's brain. \"You got me into the OR,\" he told her. \"If there is a crisis, you don't freeze, you move forward. You push the rest of us to move forward because you've seen worse, you've survived worse, and you know we'll survive too. You say you're all dark and twisty; it's not a flaw, it's a strength. It makes you who you are. I'm not gonna get down on one knee, I'm not gonna ask a question. I love you Meredith Grey, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\" She told him that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him and they kissed. \n\nAs Izzie received treatment for her cancer, Meredith allowed her to plan the wedding for Derek and herself, in which Izzie took great joy in. However, on said wedding day, Izzie began to see Denny again and Bailey and Derek looked into the cause of this hallucination. They discovered another tumor, too small to be seen normally and too small for Derek to operate safely on. With the news of Izzie dying and her previous comments about spending her life with Alex, Derek and Meredith decided to give their wedding to Izzie to give her the happiest day of her life. Meredith and Derek intended to get married at city hall but found they had no time due to Izzie's surgery and the John Doe patient. So they chose to get married by writing their vows on a post-it note. They stated that they'd love each other, even when they hated each other; that they would never walk away and that they would care for each other when they were old, senile and smelly.  The John Doe patient turned out to be their friend George.\n\nEven with their fellow colleagues arguing the two were not actually married, Meredith and Derek viewed themselves as married. They consummated their marriage everywhere, including the kitchen and stairs, and referred to themselves as married. When Meredith chose to donate part of her liver to Thatcher, Derek demanded to be allowed in the OR, stating, \"that's my wife you're cutting into.\" Eventually, they married each other legally, as it facilitated them adopting [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]]. \n\nLater, Meredith gave birth to a baby boy named Derek Bailey Shepherd, to be called \"Bailey\" after Miranda Bailey.\n\n\nProfessionally, Derek is regarded as one of the best [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeons]] in the world. His services result in two million dollars worth of annual revenue for the hospital. He is a \"tumor junkie\" and has performed numerous complicated, risky procedures, including a stand-still operation, two double-barrel brain bypasses, and separation surgery for adult conjoined twins. One of his colleagues and patients [[Isaac (Season )|Isaac]] once commented that the reason he came to Derek to take his spinal tumor out was because Derek, upon seeing his scans, was inspired rather than defeated. His confidence was shaken slightly when his surgery to repair a gunshot injury on a colleague, [[Preston Burke]], resulted in Burke\us hand developing a tremor, but Derek remains a competent and skilled surgeon who has not forgotten the importance of compassion and bedside manner when dealing with patients. He is liked by his patients and their family members as he has a way of putting them at ease.\n\nDerek's professional life hit an obstacle when [[Richard Webber]] announced his plans to retire. Derek had originally been promised the [[Chief of Surgery|chief position]] when Richard offered him the job in Seattle but was surprised to find that the position had instead been offered to Preston Burke. When word got out about Richard's retirement, Addison and Mark joined in the race for chief. Eventually, Webber came to a decision. He offered the Chief position to Derek, but Derek declined it and instead encouraged Richard to stay on as Chief.\n\nDerek's confidence took another blow when he accidentally clipped an aneurysm on a pregnant woman during surgery, remarking that it was unlike him. While [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] is in Seattle tending to [[Archer Montgomery|her brother]], she consults, and Derek suggests a risky procedure, despite knowing nothing of the procedure or its risks, feeling immensely guilty over clipping the aneurysm and will do all in his, or Addison's, power to keep her alive. Unfortunately, she dies later in surgery, upsetting her husband, who calls Derek a murderer in his grief. This sends Derek into a depression. Later, at a deposition, he learns more of his patients have died than survived, which Meredith reasoned was because he often took seriously ill patients who were at their wits' end and had come to him because no other surgeon would operate on them. Nonetheless, he walks out of Seattle Grace.\n\nWhile in his depression, pushing Meredith away and being almost constantly drunk, Bailey sends [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and later [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] to try and bring him back. Derek, however, talks to both of them and makes them feel depressed over those who they have \"killed\", prompting them to start drinking with him, until [[Richard Webber|Richard]] comes and shouts at him, telling him he is in a much better position than he was. He is promoted to Acting Chief of Surgery after Richard is forced into rehab to keep his job. After Derek orders a patient to be taken off life support against her [[Gary Clark|husband's]] wishes, the husband returns to the hospital and searches for Derek, shooting several surgeons on his way to him. The shooter eventually finds Derek and shoots him, forcing Richard to take over as interim Chief during Derek's absence from work. Derek returns and immediately quits as Chief, admitting that he hates the job and just wants to go back to being a neurosurgeon. He later tells the counselor that he had wanted to quit for a long time and the shooting prompted him to finally make the decision.\n\nOver the course of his career, Derek has been the lead surgeon on two clinical trials. The first was initiated by Meredith\upublicized as \"The Shepherd Method\", it is the injection of a live virus into a brain tumor as treatment. The second clinical trial was for the development of a cure for Alzheimer's, which he was able to fund through his earned Phillip's Grant. Derek was then blacklisted by the FDA after it was revealed that the trial was tampered with. The trial was carried on by Carl Baumann in Phoenix.\n\nAfter the plane crash<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>, Derek wasn't able to perform surgery for a while. During this time, he was teaching residents and helping [[Callie Torres]] with her trial on better prosthetics. The work on this trial led him to the development of brain sensors, which caught the attention of the president of the United States. The president requested him for a brain mapping project and gave him the opportunity to run it.\n\n\n*He played saxophone in his high school band. He also played guitar.\n*He had a scar on his forehead from a motorcycle accident.<ref>[[Save Me]], x</ref>\n*He had a thing for [[Ferry Boats|ferry boats]].\n*He drove a Porsche Cayenne\n*When he first moved to Seattle, the floor nurses described him as \"eye candy in a lab coat\"<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n*He was often seen as extremely protective over his sisters, especially [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]].\n*Derek had five kinds of scrub caps, his favorite of which depicts ferry boats.\n*He had a high risk for liver cancer, prostate cancer, baldness, and heroin addiction.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], x</ref>\n*In season one, Derek's lab coat did not show the post-nominal letters of [[Fellow of the American College of Surgeons|F.A.C.S.]]\n*In [[Almost Grown]] and [[These Arms of Mine]], there are scenes that show Derek wearing his \"[[Chief of Surgery]]\" lab coat, despite no longer holding the position at the time.\n*In [[Flight]], Cristina tries to keep everyone conscious, but it's shown that Derek is asleep and dreaming about ferryboats, as his response to Cristina is \"boats\".\n*Before surgery, Derek often said \"''[[It's a Beautiful Night to Save Lives|It's a beautiful day to save lives]]''.\"\n*In [[Save Me]], Derek revealed to Meredith lots of things because he hadn't opened up, ''My mother's maiden name, Maloney. I have four sisters. I have, uh, nine nieces. Five nephews. I like coffee ice cream, single-malt scotch, occasionally a good cigar. I like to fly fish. And I cheat when I do the crossword puzzle on Sunday. And I never dance in public. Um, favorite novel, The Sun Also Rises. Favorite band, The Clash. My favorite color is blue. I don't like light blue, indigo. The scar right here on my forehead, that's why I don't ride motorcycles anymore. And I live in that trailer. All this land is mine. I have no idea what I'm gonna do with it. So that's it. That's all you've earned for now. The rest you're just...just gonna have to take on faith.''\n*Derek claims he never understood Cristina and Dr. Burke's relationship.\n*In [[Here Comes the Flood]], Derek mentions that he is a pain specialist. In subsequent seasons he is shown to be a \"tumor junkie\" who takes on difficult brain or spinal tumors.\n*For Swedish viewers, he is known as Dr. Dr\ufmprins, meaning Dr. Dreamprince. In Brazil he's known as Bonit\ueo, which means \"Handsome\". In Finland he's known as Unelmatohtori, which means \"Dream Doctor\" or \"Doctor of (my) dreams\".\n*He missed his father every second of every minute of every day.\n*His father was never mentioned until [[Wish You Were Here]].\n*Derek's ID badge stated his department was [[Surgery|surgery]] until the merger with [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], and then it was updated to state his department as [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgery]], although there were some scenes that still show his department as surgery.\n*He thought that chewing gum while performing an autopsy is disgusting.\n*In a sense, Derek often rooted for the underdog. He mentored both [[April Kepner]] and [[Heather Brooks]], who at the time he mentored them were not very popular at the hospital.\n*He liked to have  towels in the O.R. in order to support his arms.\n*Derek's last thought was, \"It's too late\".<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref>\n*Derek was one of the \"Grey Sloan Seven\".\n*Derek was one of the \"Seattle Grace Five\".\n*He walked all his sisters except Amelia down the aisle on their wedding days.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n*He made $,, per year.<ref>[[Yesterday]], x</ref>\n*His mortality rate was .%.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n*He went to French preschool.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*His first patient death was when he was a second-year resident and his name was James Hanson.\n*Likened to a Black-Headed Nightingale-Thrush by a patient. \n*His favorite math teacher was Mr. Mulligan.\n*When [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] was , he put Derek's frog in the microwave, but claimed he never pressed start.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Devil]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nDerekShepherd.png\nxDerekShepherd.png\nxDerekShepherd.png\nxDerekShepherd.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Derek-centric or otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Save Me]]\n*[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]]\n*[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\n*[[Let the Angels Commit]]\n*[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\n*[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\n*[[Before and After]]\n*[[Ex-Life]]\n*[[An Honest Mistake]]\n*[[Stand By Me]]\n*[[Give Peace a Chance]]\n*[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\n*[[How Insensitive]]\n*[[Sanctuary]]\n*[[Death and All His Friends]]\n*[[Have You Seen Me Lately?]]\n*[[You Break My Heart]]\n*[[Flight]]\n*[[Remember the Time]]\n*[[Going, Going, Gone]]\n*[[Only Mama Knows]]\n*[[How to Save a Life]]\n*[[The Center Won't Hold]]\n*[[My Happy Ending]]\n*[[It's All Too Much]]\n*[[Good as Hell]]\n\n\n:''' [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] to Derek:''' I have no story.

[[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] had been treating them since birth. When their parents decided to allow the doctors to separate them, they were offered every pro bono dollar that the hospital could give them. The two teams of surgeons, one for each baby, practiced their parts many times before the time came for them to operate.\n\nLexie continuously updated the parents throughout the surgery, talking to them about each step.\n\nWhen the time came to separate the colon, they discovered that Andi had the bulk of the blood supply, so Arizona performed an ileoproctostomy. Then the babies were flipped so the surgery could continue and it went well.\n\nWhile they were separating their spines, they struggled to decide how to proceed without paralyzing Brandi. They made a decision and after the separation was complete, they stimulated each girl to test nerve function. Andi responded immediately, but Brandi needed much more stimulation for her feet to move.\n\nBrandi was then moved to a separate gurney and taken to a separate OR while Andi stayed in the original OR for her surgery to be finished.\n\n\nWhile Andi's surgery proceeded as expected, the one kidney left in Brandi's body failed, putting pressure on the rest of her body. They continued to operate and Alex had the idea to bring Andi, whose surgery had been finished by then, back into the OR to retrieve one of the two kidneys in her body to transplant into Brandi. As they are identical twins, there would be no need for anti-rejection meds as her body would recognize the kidney as her own. The transplant went well and both Andi and Brandi were stable in the PICU after surgery. Brandi was expected to need physical therapy, but she was already moving her legs after surgery, which was taken as a good sign.\n\n\n\nBrandi was born conjoined to her identical twin sister, Andi. They were separated in a day-long surgery. While they were in surgery, the parents were very concerned for their safety. When the surgery went well and they were both stable post-op, their parents were relieved that everything had gone well.\n\n\n*She and her surgical team were labelled with red bands and led by Arizona.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Edwards, Brandi}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

And I've held a lot of babies, I've fixed a lot of babies. But, I looked down at Zola, and I don't know what it was, but I just couldn't imagine her being with any other parent or with any other family. We've been trying so hard to start a family, and she needs one. Let's adopt her. I'm serious, let's adopt her.|[[Derek Shepherd]]}}\n{{Quote|Derek, is that our baby?\" \"Yes. Yes it is. |[[Meredith Grey]] and [[Derek Shepherd]]}}\n\n'''Zola Grey Shepherd''', born '''Zola Limbani''', is [[Meredith Grey]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek Shepherd's]] eldest daughter and child. She has a younger brother, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]], and a younger sister, [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]].\n\n\n\nZola was born with spina bifida. She came to Seattle from Malawi with a group of African kids who needed surgery. She was six months old at the time. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\nAfter she had recovered from her brain surgery, she had a second surgery to repair a hernia. [[Arizona Robbins]] said it was an uncomplicated hernia, so it was an easy fix. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\n\nShe first arrived at Seattle Grace Mercy West thanks to [[Alex Karev|Alex Karev's]] Africa Project. Derek was the first one to take a shine to her because when he was holding her to examine her, she stopped crying and Alex remarked that she liked him. Later that day, he suggested the adoption to Meredith and she agreed. They started to fill out the adoption paperwork and came to the question that asked if they were married. Derek then proposed they get married. They went to the courthouse and got married and then skipped [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and Arizona's wedding reception to go back to the hospital to spend time with Zola. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\nMeredith and Derek were granted temporary custody of Zola not long after Derek found out that Meredith had tampered with his trial to ensure that [[Adele Webber]] got the active agent. However, Meredith brought her home alone, because Derek was mad at her. She told Zola that she had a plan for the day she came home, but nothing went according to the plan. She told Zola she was very glad she was there and they'd figure it out together. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\nTwo weeks later, Zola was taken away from them due to Meredith being fired and lying to [[Janet Meyers|the social worker]] about the status of their marriage. ''(\"[[She's Gone]]\")''\n\nWhile in foster care, Zola [[Love, Loss and Legacy|came into the hospital]] because her shunt was malfunctioning and that caused an intestinal blockage. She underwent a major surgery performed by Alex Karev and Arizona Robbins. Meredith and Derek were distraught, but they could not see her because the adoption was still under examination. When Alex finally told them the surgery had gone well, Meredith burst into tears and Derek finally forgave her for what happened with the clinical trial. Later that night, they sang a lullaby to her over the phone while [[Cristina Yang]] was taking care of her at the hospital. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\nLater, Meredith and Derek got a hearing to try to regain custody. This was probably thanks to Alex tracking down the judge and telling him that Meredith and Derek were the best possible parents for Zola. ''(\"[[Put Me In, Coach]]\")''\n\nDespite this, not long after that phone call, the social worker told Meredith that since their hearing had been canceled, they were probably not going to get custody. ''(\"[[Dark Was the Night]]\")''\n\nHowever, the following morning, she brought Zola to Meredith and Derek's and told them that the baby was theirs and they had full custody. ''(\"[[Suddenly]]\")''\n\n\nFor Zola's first birthday, her parents planned a party with their friends. However, when the celebration for Richard's ,th surgery had to be canceled, they used the cake Meredith made for the birthday to celebrate that instead. ''(\"[[Hope for the Hopeless]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith and Derek tried to have some time for themselves the morning of Valentine's Day and asked [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] to listen for Zola. She did and they went outside to have some alone time, but shortly thereafter Lexie knocked on the car window carrying Zola and apologized telling them that Zola woke up and really seemed to want them. They all went back inside and Lexie offered to babysit Zola for the night so that they could have some time to themselves since she had no plans. They took her up on the offer and Lexie babysat Zola for the night. \n\nAfter telling [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] earlier in the day that Zola was her hot date for the night Lexie carried Zola around the house, talking to her about whether or not she should go over to Mark's and tell him that she still loves him. When Derek and Meredith got home, Lexie asked if they could take her so that she could leave, but Derek told her to take Zola with her and drive her around as she loved that. Lexie decided to do so and showed up at Mark's apartment with Zola, saying she thought the Zola and Sofia could have a play date and they could talk. She then realized that [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] was there and was making Mark dinner. Mark invited them in and Zola and Sofia had a play date while Mark, Lexie, and Jackson had dinner together. ''(\"[[All You Need is Love]]\")''\n\n\nThe same day Meredith had to leave for San Francisco to take her boards, Zola got sick, which made Meredith feel guilty for leaving her. Derek promised Zola would be fine and took care of her as she threw up on all her clothes, leaving her to wear a bumblebee costume. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was offered a job at The Brigham, the family planned a move to Boston. However, shortly before they were set to leave, her parents were both involved in a plane crash. ''(\"[[Flight]]\")''\n\nDerek still wanted to go to Boston, but Meredith looked at the condition the others were in and said she wanted to stay in Seattle because that's where she started her family. ''(\"[[Remember the Time]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Bailey got her genome lab up and running, Meredith came to her with Zola and said that she wanted to be around to fight for her kid, so she needed to know if she was going to get Alzheimer's. She realized she didn't know anything about Zola's genes, so she wanted Bailey to map her as well. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\n\nWhile at daycare, Zola fell and needed two staples in her head. She'd been promised a princess tea party that day, but because of her parents' busy work schedules, she didn't get it. ''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\n\nFor Halloween, Zola went as a butterfly. Her butterfly wings ripped, so Derek fixed them with [[Ben Warren|Ben's]] help. They when went trick or treating with baby Bailey, plus [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] and her moms. ''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[James Peterson]] proposed to [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], she fled to Seattle to think. She took care of the kids while she was there, something she found difficult. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Derek decided to go to DC to work with the NIH, Zola spent some time sleeping in the bed with Meredith. ''(\"[[Where Do We Go From Here]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek realized what he was missing and said he didn't want to miss anymore, he prepared to move back. ''(\"[[When I Grow Up]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day Derek left for his final trip to DC to tie up loose ends, he was in a car accident. Meredith took Zola and Bailey with her to the hospital, where they stayed with a social worker while Meredith had life support turned off and sat with Derek while he died. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, and Meredith moved to San Diego temporarily after Derek died. Meredith was pregnant with a new baby. Around the time she was due, Meredith's water broke on the kitchen floor. She tried to act like everything was all right, but she fell down and went into labor. Zola saw the blood and asked if she should call . This reminded Meredith of the time her mother slit her wrists and bled out in front of her. Her mom then told Meredith not to dial  yet. Despite remembering that event, Meredith told Zola to call , and she was taken to a hospital. The social worker at the hospital asked Zola if she was the \"smart girl who knew how to call \" and Zola nodded. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Ellis was born, Meredith took her three kids and moved back to Seattle. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\nMeredith decided she couldn't keep living in the house Derek built, so it was sold and they moved back to the house where they lived when they first got Zola with Amelia and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]]. ''(\"[[You're My Home]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Meredith was attacked by a patient, Arizona and Alex brought Zola, Bailey, and Ellis in to see her. However, the three of them were too scared by her appearance and the visit was brief. After she had recovered, the family was happily reunited at home. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was nominated for a Harper Avery, Zola was supposed to go with her to Boston for the ceremony. However, Zola knew her mother didn't like flying, so she wasn't surprised when Meredith decided not to go. Instead, she spent the day with Maggie learning some anatomy. They later watched from the gallery as Meredith watched the feed of the awards and learned she had won. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nZola was asked to be a flower girl at [[Jo and Alex's Wedding]]. They arrived at the wedding to find that most of the guests weren't there because the GPS link on the wedding website sent them to the wrong place. While waiting for the ceremony to begin, Zola and Sofia, who was also a flower girl, played together. After a series of mishaps, including the wedding planner having an allergic reaction to shrimp and being sent to the hospital, the wedding party and guests boarded a ferry, where Alex and Jo were married by Meredith and Zola performed her duties as flower girl. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith came home with new outfits, Zola requested a fashion show. Meredith agreed to show off one outfit because it was late and they needed to get to bed. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Zola's school was having a bake sale, she asked Meredith to make chocolate cookies, not chocolate chip. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\n\nOn Dia De Los Muertos, Zola and her friend, [[Angela]], dressed up and had their faces painted for a parade at their school. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n\nZola attended her brother's fifth birthday party. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Thatcher died, he left presents for Ellis, Bailey, and Zola in his closet. Meredith took those present to her kids and told them about their grandpa. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nZola appeared in one of Meredith's dreams. In the dream her grandmother [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]] told Zola something to tell to her mother, then told her to write it down quickly. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\n\nWhile getting water in the middle of the night, Zola caught [[Andrew DeLuca]] trying to sneak out of the house after a night with Meredith. Later, Meredith sat Zola and her siblings down with ice cream and told them that Andrew was at the house because the two of them had been spending more time together. When Zola asked if Andrew was Meredith's boyfriend, Meredith said yes. Zola was fine with their relationship but requested that Andrew not bring his guitar\ualike the last time he stayed over. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nDuring breakfast, Amelia talked to Meredith about Andrew, and Zola asked if they were talking about Meredith's boyfriend. Amelia said that they were and was surprised that Meredith had told Zola about Andrew. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\n\nJust before Meredith decided to turn herself in to the police for committing insurance fraud, she sat Zola, Bailey, and Ellis down and told them that she would be gone for some time. Zola asked how long Meredith would be gone, and she said just for a little while. Meredith didn't give them details but assured them that Alex, Maggie, and Amelia would be there for them. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nZola came to Meredith one morning saying she felt sick. She had a headache that persisted through breakfast, so Meredith took her to the hospital and demanded that [[Tom Koracick|Tom]] get her a CT immediately, reporting to him Zola's medical history. Tom did the CT, which showed that she just needed a shunt revision, commonly required when children grow. He took her in for surgery, which went smoothly. After her surgery, Zola was awake and recovering. ''(\"[[Breathe Again]]\")''\n\n\nAt Halloween, Zola wore her butterfly costume again. When Andrew tried to help her put the wings on, she got upset with him and said he's not her dad. She later told Andrew that her father had fixed her wings before he died and she didn't want people to forget him. Andrew assured her that that would never happen. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n\nZola came to Meredith one day, saying that she'd finished her science project and she wanted to show Alex. Meredith then had to explain to her that Alex wasn't coming back to Seattle. ''(\"[[Leave a Light On]]\")''\n\n\nZola helped hook up Meredith's computer to the television so she and Meredith could watch [[Richard Webber|Richard]]'s PATH pen presentation together. They watched the presentation, but quickly realized something was wrong. He presented, but wasn't making any sense. Meredith asked Zola to get her phone for her. Shortly afterward, the stream was disconnected. ''(\"[[Love of My Life]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, Zola stayed home with her brother and sister, Amelia, [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]], and her new cousin, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] while her mom treated COVID patients at the hospital and eventually became sick with COVID- herself and had to be admitted. When Amelia realized she'd missed Link's birthday, she convinced the kids to watch a movie by saying it was Link's birthday wish, giving them some free time. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nPrior to her mom getting sick, Zola attended her brother's birthday party that year where he stuck his face right in the cake and then licked the icing off his fingers and made a big production of it. This made Zola, Ellis, Meredith, Amelia, Link, and Maggie laugh. Zola laughed so hard she peed her pants which just made everyone laugh even harder. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith ended up in a coma on a ventilator due to COVID-, Zola overheard Amelia talking about Meredith being sick and became worried that her mom was going to die. Amelia and Maggie later sat down with her and explained to her what was happening. She was worried, but simply said they shouldn't tell Bailey and Ellis unless they had to, because they were too young to understand. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\nShortly after Andrew died, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis had a dance party in the backyard while the grieving adults supervised and tried to figure out how to tell the kids, who had loved Andrew. Zola also later talked to Amelia about living forever and if they'd choose it or not. Zola said if she could create a medicine that would make someone live forever, she'd give it to her mom. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nLater, Eric and Maureen Lincoln bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nZola increasingly struggled with her mom being sick, especially after the death of George Floyd. She knew Meredith would be angry as well, but told Maggie she didn't want to go to any protests without her mom. One day, after learning she signed out of her math class early, Maggie talked to Zola about her struggles and encouraged her to scream to express how she was feeling. Later, Winston had the idea to sneak Zola into Meredith's hospital room in the hopes it would encourage her to wake up. After putting Zola in PPE, they walked her through to Meredith's room. She stood by Meredith's bedside and spoke to her until she woke up, then hugged her happily. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her pulmonary studies showed a remarkable improvement in her lung capacity and her labs came out clear, Meredith was discharged from the hospital. Instead of leaving to a fanfare, she had Jackson slip her out the back and drop her off at home, where her kids greeted her happily. Because she hadn't told anyone she was coming, the kids' welcome home poster was unfinished, but she appreciated it anyway and asked her kids to tell her everything that had happened while she was gone. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn August of , Zola attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. However, at the wedding, Maggie's father and Winston's grandmother opposed the wedding, wanting to wait until more people could attend, so the wedding was postponed. In April , a new wedding was planned and they all attended. Zola helped her mother spread flower petals on the beach in preparation for the wedding and then she walked down the aisle with her mother and siblings to spread more flower petals at the start of the ceremony. During the reception Zola, along with both of her siblings, held engagement rings for Link as he proposed to Amelia on the beach after the ceremony. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nAfter working with Addison on a surgery and talking to her about Derek, Meredith invited Addison to her house to meet her kids. They were happy to meet her and asked if she was a friend of their dad's. She said that she was and they immediately got along. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith got stuck in Minnesota when snow caused her flight to be canceled, Amelia was left to cook the meal alone as well as care for all four children by herself. When Link came to drop off Scout and learned this, he decided to stay and help. When he discovered that the oven wasn't on and the turkey was not cooking, he helped her change the meal plan. The kids happily ate the replacement meal when Link said he'd pardoned the turkey. While they ate, Zola asked what an AVM was and Amelia explained. Bailey then asked what sex was, shocking the adults.\n\nAfter dinner, Link and all four kids had a dance party. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nWhen Cormac came to check on Farouk one day, he asked Megan how she was and suggested she go take a break or a nap. Megan told Cormac that if Farouk died, she would die with him. She had survived so much in her life and had no desire to survive Farouk's death. When a heart became available in Tacoma for Farouk, Teddy, Owen, and Cormac went to retrieve it. While they were gone, Winston took Farouk to the OR so he would be ready when the donor heart arrived. Evelyn came to the hospital to sit with Megan while she waited. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nAs Christmas approached, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis helped their mother decorate a Christmas tree at their house. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nZola enjoyed watching her grandmother's surgical tapes, even watching some of them multiple times. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith traveled to Minnesota to finish up the report on Hamilton's surgery and then spend the weekend with Nick, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis spent the weekend with Maggie and Winston. When Ellis hid during a game of hide and seek, she inadvertently discovered a box of Ellis Sr.'s things, including a letter she had written to Maggie many years prior. Zola admitted to Winston that she felt bad for wondering if her birth mother thought about her, because she didn't want Meredith to be sad about it. Winston told her it was normal to wonder where you came from. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith returned home from her trip to Minnesota to present Hamilton's case to the staff at the Mayo, Nick came with her. They brought pizza to her house and he met her three children. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen both Meredith and Zola got sick, they spent the day at home together. Zola was happy when she saw that Meredith was ignoring her work, but questioned why she was avoiding Nick and Hamilton at the end of the day. Meredith explained that she'd been offered a job in Minnesota, one that would require them to move. Zola assured her that she, Bailey, and Ellis would follow her anywhere. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith held a dinner party at her house so that everyone could get to know Nick better, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis attended the party. While they waited for dinner to be ready, they played in the backyard with Amelia and Kai and then played hide and seek. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nZola was excited about the planned move to Minnesota and helped Meredith look at houses there where they could live. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\n\nZola had written a paper about her hero, Ellis Grey, and was a finalist for their merit program. She presented it with her mom, aunts, Winston, and Nick in the audience. During her speech, she started to struggle, saying that because Early Onset Alzheimer's was genetic, her mom and aunt would get it and die and then she'd be alone. When Meredith saw her struggling, she went on stage and comforted her. ''(\"[[Wasn't Expecting That]]\")''\n\nWhen Zola had another panic attack before school, Meredith instead took her to the hospital and told Zola to sit in her office and do homework. Zola left the office and ended up in a lab with Nick, who was impressed with how quickly she figured out the surgical training exercises. She also quickly solved Kai's puzzles, which were extremely difficult even for adults. At the end of the day, Meredith was told she was extremely gifted and this was likely the cause of some of her struggles. ''(\"[[Let's Talk About Sex]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith searched for a school that would meet all of Zola's needs, they celebrated Halloween. Zola dressed as one of the Incredibles. After trick or treating, she went to a sleepover with friends, but she called Meredith part of the way through to pick her up, saying she had started to panic. Meredith assured her that things would get better once they found her the right school. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\nMeredith and Zola went around the country touring schools. In Boston, Zola shadowed at Brookline STEAM Academy. She told Meredith she hated it when they first arrived, but at the end of the day, when Meredith pushed, she admitted that she loved it. Meredith decided they'd be moving to Boston. ''(\"[[When I Get to the Border]]\")''\n\nWith the move incoming, the whole family started preparing for the move. When a lightning storm hit, Maggie and Winston stayed at the house with the kids packing things while Meredith worked. They told the kids to stay inside, despite Zola noting the low odds of them being struck by lightning. Later, the kids were scared when lightning struck the house, starting a fire. They quickly evacuated and were reunited with Meredith outside as they watched the firefighters of [[SFD Station |Station ] try to put out the fire. Meredith assured them that what was most important was that they were all safe. ''(\"[[Thunderstruck]]\")''\n\n\n\nParents\nZola quickly bonded with Derek after he and Meredith decided to try to adopt her. Meredith bonded with her as well, but more slowly.\n\nDerek occasionally struggled with being a white man raising a black daughter. He tried to set up a playdate between Zola and Bailey's much older son, [[William George Bailey Jones|Tuck]], though Bailey shot that idea down. She suggested to him that the reason people were staring wasn't that he's white and Zola's black but because he didn't know how to do Zola's hair and it didn't look good. She showed him how to do Zola's hair properly. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek later learned about [[Maggie Pierce]], he encouraged Meredith to try to bond with her, saying Zola needed more black people in the family because he was running out of ways to braid Zola's hair and Bailey wouldn't show him anymore. ''(\"[[Don't Let's Start]]\")''\n\nAfter baby Bailey was born, Zola's parents worked to make sure she knew she hadn't been replaced by her brother. In order to give Meredith more time for her work, Derek decided to step back from his work and stay home with the kids more. ''(\"[[Map of You]]\")''\n\nSiblings\nAfter her brother Bailey was born, Meredith said Zola wanted to take him to daycare to show him off. ''(\"[[Seal Our Fate]]\")'' Zola has been shown to be very protective of her younger siblings and asked her aunts not to tell them bad news about their mom's condition when she was sick with COVID- unless they absolutely had to.

Because of his large size, they were worried they wouldn't be able to handle his case. He had to be brought in by several firefighters. In the ER, they did x-rays and other tests to try to determine the cause of his pain. They also lifted his abdomen and found a severe skin infection over the skin that had been obscured. When they went to take him to get tests, they found that the gurney wouldn't fit through a doorway. They were going to try moving him, but he stood up and tried to walk himself, even though he hadn't walked in a year. He took several steps, but his ankle gave out and he fell to the ground. His ankle was broken. They needed to run a CT, but he was too heavy, so they had to rely on labs.\n\nHis wife told him he'd been laid off five years prior. He'd tried to find work, but after two years, he hadn't found anything and eating made him feel better and that's when he started to gain the weight.\n\nHe had a deep tissue infection, so they needed to operate to remove the infection. It was a very risky surgery, so Derek told them to refer him to a bariatric center. However, Webber convinced him to see Bobby as a patient, not as a potential lawsuit. He agreed to let them operate. When Bobby was told he needed surgery, he tried to decline, knowing he would die, but thinking it might be better if he dies before his kid is born because growing up with him for a dad would be no life for a kid.\n\nAfter talking to Bobby's wife about him, Alex went to Bobby and convinced him to do the work, to let them operate and then change his lifestyle so he could be the father his kid deserves.\n\nThey took him into surgery, where they found a perforated colon. They were able to save him, but he was told he needed to make serious lifestyle changes or he would still not make it.\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Melissa Corso]].\n\n\nHe and his wife are expecting a baby together.\n\n\nHe'd been laid off from his job five years prior. After two years of job searching, he gave up trying to find another job.\n\n\n*He weighed  pounds.\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corso, Bobby}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

When admitted to hospital, she held his hand as much as she could.\n\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Amanda stays with George.]]\nAmanda was admitted to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] after [[George O'Malley|a man]] pushed her out of the way from a bus. The man was dragged by the bus and by the time the bus driver had stopped, his face was unrecognisable. Paramedics brought the John Doe and Amanda to the hospital.\n\nAlthough she had ignored him at the bus stop because he was average-looking, as he began to crash and the doctors attempted to save him, she refused to leave him alone, but was removed from the room after she vomited. Later her arm was stitched up by [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] and then Mark and she gave [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] tips on how to be the woman in a relationship.\n\nFor the rest of the day, she stayed as close to the John Doe as possible and up until just before his surgery, she held his hand. When [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] told her she had to leave because they were taking him to surgery, she cried and walked away to the waiting room. Meredith noted that he ''\"...made a good friend there. Guess that's what happens when you take a bus for someone.\"'' ''(\"[[Now or Never]]\")''\n\n\nAfter everyone discovered it was George, she continued to wait by his bedside and apologize. She attended his funeral and cried harder than his mother. After the funeral, she suffered from insomnia. She saw George at night and at bus stops. She came into the hospital, where Meredith prescribed her anti-anxiety drugs to help her sleep. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\nEvery day, she went to Seattle Grace and sat at the benches outside. More than a month after his death, [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] saw Amanda sitting on the bench and called her out for wasting the life George saved and she finally left. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\n\nAmanda is a single girl and shortly before George O'Malley saved her life, she had been looking for guys at the bus stop but ignored George because she thought he was only average-looking.\n\n\n*Kaley Cuoco was originally cast to play Amanda but due to commitments with ''The Big Bang Theory'', she was not available and [[Shannon Lucio]] was chosen instead.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nAmanda.png|[[Now or Never]]\nxAmanda.png|[[Good Mourning]]\nxAmanda.png|[[Goodbye]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Amanda (Now or Never) Appearances}}\n[[de:Amanda]]\n[[fr:Amanda]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

During his interview, he said that he had to keep his phone on him in case he got a call from [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], his first choice. However, when they sent him a rejection during the interview, he quickly changed his mind and sung the praises of Grey Sloan Memorial and Seattle. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nVik attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a roller coaster derailed at a fair, Vik and Taryn tended to [[Dean Parson]], who was injured while pushing kids out of the way. They noticed free fluid in his abdomen and he was taken to surgery, despite Amelia ordering a CT. When Taryn informed Amelia of this, Amelia brought the CT into the OR to do the scan. They found a bleed in his brain and Amelia did a craniotomy. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Vik came into the OR to replace Taryn, he was instead sent out to find her and Jo. He did so and stayed with them until Alex and Meredith arrived and told them they could leave. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nVik worked on David Roman, who came into the ER after trying to cut off his hand because he believed he was sinning by masturbating often. Vik made a couple jokes at his expense. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\n\nVik decided to sneak into the presentations for the surgical contest. While he was there, he took a cookie from Arizona's tin before Bailey discovered he was there and pulled him out. Despite this, he later lied and said he hadn't had any of the cookies in order to enter a contest to get to scrub in on a Whipple. He later went to a patient who needed a central line and started to freak out due to the weed. He ended up backing into a cart and falling, which caused him to get stabbed in the arm with a scalpel. When Richard learned Vik had lied about the cookie, he fired Vik for endangering a patient. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Vik got fired for endangering patients while high, he hired his brother, [[Sanjay Roy|Sanjay]] to represent him as he sued Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital for wrongful termination. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\nVik agreed to drop the suit and return to work if he got paid for the weeks he missed plus a formal apology from Bailey. Bailey initially resisted, but at a subsequent meeting, Bailey told him he was lucky to have the experience of learning from the doctors at Grey Sloan. She agreed to hire him back with a one-year probationary period. If he didn't screw that up, she'd make him an amazing surgeon. He accepted the apology. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")''\n\n\nAfter his return, as promised, he had to stay by Bailey's side. When [[Matthew Taylor]] came in after a car accident, he helped operate on him to remove his spleen. When he learned that April was also in a car accident and it wasn't looking good, he was upset because he said he liked April. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Lila (All of Me)|Lila's]] mother collapsed at her wedding, Vik met them at the ER to help treat her. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Barry Clemens]] came into the ER with abdominal pain, Vik ended up on the case. When an x-ray showed a large object in Barry's rectum, Vik bet that it was a shampoo bottle. He was also surprised to learn that it didn't mean that Barry was gay as the male pleasure spot is inside the rectum. Later, in Barry's surgery, Vik spotted a bleeder. Despite being told by Richard to wait, Vik cauterized it, which caused the bottle of hair spray to bounce around the OR, injuring Vik and was possibly the reason Barry died in surgery. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Alex was named interim chief, Vik had to follow him around. Vik helped clear the ER of family and the police. When [[Tad]] came in with a nosebleed, Vik parked him in a bed and said he'd come back to pack it. When he returned five hours later, Tad was still bleeding and coughed up blood. Tom stepped up and helped him treat Tad, but it was too late and Tad died. When Koracick told Vik to call time of death since Tad was his patient, Vik refused and left the room saying that he was just an intern and Tad's death wasn't on him. Alex came to the locker room later and fired Vik, citing his lie about having taken care of Tad and his inability to take responsibility for his neglience. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nAfter April had a day with several cases that made her question God and her faith, she went to the bar, where Vik came to sit next to her. The two ended up leaving together. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\nThey continued to sleep together, but with no contact during daylight. Despite this, he fell asleep at her place more than once. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nHe took advantage of their relationship to get better opportunities at work. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\n\nHe was a surgical intern at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] until he got fired because he attempted to treat patients while high. He was hired back when he hired his lawyer brother to represent him in a wrongful termination lawsuit, although he was to work under Bailey's close supervision.

Once they arrived, several doctors came out to assess Ivan. Ivan kept insisting that it looked worse than it was and that Gigi hadn't meant any harm. When Animal Control was delayed, Winston had the idea to spray Gigi with alcohol, which would irritate her eyes and get her to release her jaw so they could free him. Bailey did that and then Winston, Jordan, and Link unwrapped Gigi from Ivan's body. Then they got him onto a gurney and took him inside.\n\nIn the ER, he had reduced oxygen and a chest x-ray showed opacity in his chest. Richard believed it was a hemothorax and wanted to insert a chest tube, but Bailey said no and insisted on a CT, which showed that Ivan actually had a diaphragmatic rupture and the opacity was his abdominal organs, which had been compressed into his chest cavity. They took him into surgery, where they moved his organs back into his abdomen. When he started coding and went into DIC, they were forced to stop the surgery, pack him, and move him to the ICU.\n\nOn the way to the ICU, he coded again, and Bailey did chest compressions until they got him into his room, where they defibrillated.

She married [[Sam Bennett]] twice, with whom she has a daughter, [[Maya Bennett|Maya]], and is expecting another child. She is the best friend to Addison Montgomery and a founding partner of the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]].\n\n\n\nIn High School, Naomi was extremely overweight and had to endure many jokes and nicknames about her weight.\n\nWhile attending Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Naomi met [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], [[Mark Sloan]], and [[Sam Bennett]]. Eventually, Naomi married Sam and had a daughter, [[Maya Bennett|Maya]].\n\n\nWilliam White and Naomi were at dinner when he explained that he wanted to create a leading medical practice, and wanted Naomi to run it. She initially declined the offer, but William told her that he had been researching and found that she was one of the best fertility specialists, and she built one of the first whole wellness medical practices. She said she wasn't interested.\n\nLater, William met her at the practice and invited her to lunch, where Naomi discussed how the practice was her \"baby\" and that the people working there were her family. William admired that, but he said that he would be back in two weeks to make an official offer to her.<ref>[[What You Do for Love]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nNaomi later confided in Addison that she was offered Charlotte King's job to run Pacific Wellcare Center. Addison was surprised and said that Oceanside was Naomi's practice, but she said that it wasn't hers anymore because of the recent events that happened and that she was considering the offer.<ref>[[Yours, Mine & Ours]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile travelling around the world doing work for the William White Foundation, Naomi felt a new purpose in her life. Each time, it became harder for her to take a break from that work and return to the practice and its debates and the sometimes morally questionable decisions that were made there. When [[Gabriel Fife]] returned from D.C. in an attempt to pursue her to move back there with him, she began to contemplate starting over. Though she initially turned him down, citing her obligations to the practice and her family, now also including [[Betsey Parker]], Sam pointed out that she was merely making up excuses not to be loved. Letting go of all her obligations, Naomi then rushed to the airport to chase Fife. She came too late to board the plane but was surprised when Fife showed up. He had gotten off the plane as he had strongly suspected she would show up. He then pulled out a ring and proposed. She happily accepted and told him they were moving to New York City rather than D.C. so that she could help out Maya, who had been accepted into Columbia University.\n\n\nNaomi returned to Los Angeles for Addison and Jake's wedding and was Addison's maid of honor.\n\nAfter speaking with Sam at the reception, they ended up having sex, which resulted in Naomi becoming pregnant. When she visited Addison again, Addison did an ultrasound and Naomi admitted that she and Fife weren't together anymore. Addison did the math and figured out that Naomi had gotten pregnant at her wedding and Naomi confessed that she had slept with Sam, though she refused to tell Sam about the pregnancy.\n\nAfter Naomi went back to work, Sam interrupted Naomi's meeting and professed his love for her. Naomi then tells him that she was going to have a baby, and they kissed.<ref>[[In Which We Say Goodbye]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nNaomi has a very sunny personality and is often the person people go to, to confide in. She is very smart and confident in her field. She believes in faith and is a great person to hang out with. She also eats chocolate when she is stressed, sad, or even mad.\n\n\n\n[[Sam Bennett]]\nSam and Naomi dated in college and after college, they married almost immediately. They had a daughter and after many years of happiness, Sam woke up one morning and decided he wanted a divorce. Naomi worked alongside her ex-husband, [[Sam Bennett|Sam]], with whom she had a relatively friendly, but often strained, relationship, for many years before she left [[Los Angeles]] to be with [[Gabriel Fife]].\n\nShe later returned to [[Los Angeles]] for [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison's]] wedding, at which she had a one-night stand with Sam, which resulted in a pregnancy.\n\nThree months later, Naomi returned to L.A. where Sam, oblivious to the fact that Naomi was pregnant, declared his love for her again. Naomi revealed her pregnancy to him and the two reunited and re-married.<ref>[[In Which We Say Goodbye]], x (PP)</ref>\ua\n\n[[Dell Parker]]\nDell Parker, the office receptionist, had a crush on Naomi, and often showed it by getting her coffee, bringing her home-baked chocolate cake, and generally complimenting and adoring her. Naomi didn't take this crush seriously, calling him a \"kid,\" but Dell decided to fight for her and kissed her. He admitted he didn't have it all together, but he told her he was a man, not a kid. Only seconds later, Sam also kissed Naomi, encouraging Dell to fight for her even harder.\n\n[[Archer Montgomery]]\nFollowing the separation, and the brief fling with Sam, she began seeing other people, until she inadvertently slept with [[Archer Montgomery]], to Addison's dismay. Addison told her that Archer would only hurt her. Unfortunately for Naomi, Addison was right, catching Archer ending a date with another woman and walking in on Archer after he had sex with [[Charlotte King]]. Afterward, he left, leaving Naomi devastated.<ref>[[Wait and See]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAfter a long time apart, they had another one night stand when his mother died.<ref>[[Home Again]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n[[William White]]\nNaomi initially met William when he was convincing her to run a practice that he owned. She declined multiple times, but he met her at the practice and invited her to lunch, where she still declined his offer.<ref>[[What You Do for Love]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nNaomi began dating him, but he later died. It began as a flirtation before she had to write a speech about him.\n\n[[Gabriel Fife]]\nThey first met when he was hired at her new job. They were antagonistic at first. She became engaged to Gabriel Fife and was raising Dell's daughter Betsey with him until they separated at some point after they left [[Los Angeles]].\n\nOthers\nNaomi had her first date since college, which didn't go too well because all she could talk about was her job.<ref>[[In Which Charlotte Goes Down the Rabbit Hole]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n[[Maya Bennett]]\nMaya is Naomi and Sam's daughter. Naomi wanted her to get an abortion after learning that Maya was pregnant. However, when Maya chose not to, Naomi was upset at her and retreated into her work. She ignored Maya's decision to get married to her boyfriend. She later followed Maya to New York to help her adjust to college.\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nNaomi and Addison have been friends since medical school. They consider each other best friends, but they hadn't spoken after Addison's divorce with Derek until Addison's trip to LA. After Addison joined the practice, their friendship grew stronger again. The friendship hit a rough patch during Addison's and Sam's relationship, but they were able to overcome this over time and got back to being great friends.\n\n\nDr. Naomi Bennett is a [[Board Certification|board-certified]] [[Board Certification#American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology|reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist]], as well as a founding partner of the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. Although Dr. Bennett's primary area of expertise is in fertility, she is also board certified in obstetrics and gynecology. She is a member of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, and the [[Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]].\n\nThe owner of [[Pacific Wellcare Center]], [[William White]] visited Naomi and asked her to lunch, with the intention of offering her a job as the new director of Pacific Wellcare. Naomi refused initially, but William started making points about what he could offer, such as leadership of the practice, which Naomi feels she no longer has at [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. She eventually takes the job, and in the process, Charlotte King is fired.\n\nWilliam's reasons for hiring her were because she has a heart, where he can obtain the best people in their field for his practice, Naomi is the reason they will stay.\n\n\n*She is Catholic.\n*She loves cake, particularly cheesecake.\n*Naomi hates pilates.\n*She does the crossword puzzle in the newspaper in pen because she rarely makes mistakes in them.<ref>[[In Which Sam Receives an Unexpected Visitor]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Despite having two [[Board Certification|board certifications]] in [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] and [[Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility|REI]], she has never been referred to as \"double-board certified\".

But the carousel never stops turning. You can't get off.|'''Ellis Grey'''}}\n\n'''Ellis Grey''' was the mother of [[Meredith Grey]] and the ex-wife of [[Thatcher Grey]]. She was also the birth mother of [[Maggie Pierce]]. During her time, she was a world-famous surgeon who was twice honored with the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. She was later diagnosed with [[Medical Glossary#A|Alzheimer's]].\n\n\n\nEllis was born on August , . Her mother was the \"quintessential housewife\", everything had to be perfect from her pleats to her A-line skirt. Her father had numerous affairs with all of his secretaries, which her mother detested but never said a word. Ellis swore never to become someone's doormat as a result. At some point in her life, she met [[Thatcher Grey]]. They married, and welcomed [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] into their lives in early , when Ellis was .  \n\n\nWhen she was pregnant with Meredith, she refused to acknowledge it at any point. When she went into labor, she came to Thatcher in awe, laughing and smiling, finally admitting that they were having a baby. On his deathbed, he said he'd never seen her so happy and carefree before. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nStarting in , when he first came to the hospital, Ellis, along with [[Richard Webber]], treated [[Phillip Nichols]], who ultimately ended up being the first patient in Seattle to be diagnosed with GRID, now known as AIDS. They operated on him even without knowing how AIDS was transmitted. They later stood by his bedside as he died and later toasted his death at [[Emerald City Bar]], where Ellis convinced Richard to toast with alcohol instead of soda. ''(\"[[The Time Warp]]\")''\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ellis had finished med school and started her [[Resident|surgical residency]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], where she was often looked down on because she was one of the few and first female surgeons. Due to her large professional drive and her wanting to prove herself, she worked long hours and didn't spend much time with her family.\n\n[[File:xRichardLeavesEllis.png|thumb|px|Ellis is left alone after Richard chooses Adele.]]\n\nShe bonded with her fellow resident [[Richard Webber|Richard]], who was also being looked down on because of his skin color. They soon started off an affair and began planning a life together. In June , the two of them made a deal to tell their spouses about their affair and leave them, as they didn't want to continue cheating. Right after making the deal, Richard overheard that Ellis was put on the shortlist for the Harper Avery Award for the Grey Method, being the first resident to ever make it onto that list. That night, Ellis told Thatcher, but Richard chose to be with his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]] because he was hopelessly jealous of Ellis's professional success and didn't want to feel like that his entire life. \n\n[[File:xEllisSlitWrists.png|thumb|px|Ellis slit her wrists.]]\n\nDevastated over the fact that Richard left her, Ellis slit her wrists in front of Meredith on June , . Ellis told Meredith not to be scared of the blood and forbade her to call . Eventually, Ellis passed out, and Meredith called . She was transported to the ER and her life was saved, thanks to Meredith. Eventually, Meredith learned that Ellis, being the fantastic surgeon that she was, would have known that the way she slit her wrists would not have killed her, making it clear to her that it was not a suicide attempt, but rather a cry for Richard's attention.\n\n\nWhile being treated, Ellis was discovered to be pregnant with Richard's child, which is why she decided to move to Boston. She stopped drinking wine and wrote down what she ate in her journals, indicating Ellis did want her baby to be healthy. Ellis took her daughter with her and they hid in their apartment. Ellis cried a lot, but Meredith knew not to ask any questions. Eventually, Ellis's water broke and she gave birth to [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] on November , , placing her for adoption. She was sure she wanted to sign away all her rights to the baby, because she needed to start over after Richard left her.\n\nEllis chose [[Bill Pierce|Bill]] and [[Diane Pierce]] to raise Maggie. She described them as kind, loving, hard-working people. They offered to give Ellis occasional updates on Maggie's life, but Ellis declined. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\nAfter Maggie was living with her parents, Ellis and Meredith didn't have to hide anymore, so they moved across town to a nice house. Meredith started first grade and Ellis started her fellowship at [[Massachusetts General Hospital|Mass Gen]], continuing her career.\n\n\nSometime after her daughter turned eight, Ellis won her second Harper Avery Award, which was for the Ellis Grey Procedure. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")'' The procedure was developed with her best friend, [[Marie Cerone]], but Ellis omitted Marie's name from its publishing due to the fact that she was blacklisted from ever winning a Harper Avery Award. This ended the friendship between the two of them. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her diagnosis, Ellis wrote a letter to Maggie as she was forced to face her own mortality. In the letter, she described her decision not to see Maggie as one she was proud of. Her one regret was that Meredith and Maggie didn't meet. She also said she knew that Maggie would be better off with Bill and Diane. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\nBy the time Meredith started her internship, Ellis was living at the [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]]. Her case was advanced, and she most often thought she was still completing her residency. When she talked to Meredith, she sometimes thought she was a friend of hers from college.\n\nAfter her disease progressed to the point where she could no longer handle her own affairs, they had her sign everything over to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]]. ''(\"[[Shake Your Groove Thing]]\")''\n\n\nEllis was brought to the hospital with cramping pain and diarrhea. Because of her Alzheimer's, she was confused and aggressive. She believed that [[George O'Malley|George]] was Thatcher and [[Preston Burke|Burke]] was Richard. Scans confirmed diverticulitis, but also revealed a liver mass. They biopsied the mass, but it was found to be benign. ''(\"[[Make Me Lose Control]]\")''\n\nThey removed the mass and three days later, she was stable and recovering well. She disappeared from her hospital bed and was found around the hospital wearing scrubs and thinking she was still a doctor. They got her to come back to her room, but she disappeared again, this time going to a scrub room to prepare for a surgery she believed she'd be doing. Because of her multiple escapes, she had to be put in restraints. ''(\"[[Deny, Deny, Deny]]\")''\n\nOnce she had recovered, she was discharged back to Roseridge. ''(\"[[Bring the Pain]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out that Ellis had Alzheimer's, Richard began to visit her at Roseridge. He then asked Derek to come check on Ellis and see if she was eligible for an Alzheimer's research trial. She was and Richard convinced Meredith to agree. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\n\nRichard started visiting Ellis after her Alzheimer's was revealed to him. They shared stories of their residency, a time she remembered well. Meredith saw them together and after thinking about it, told Richard he should keep visiting her as it made her happy. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nThe nursing home called Meredith because Ellis had been refusing to eat. Ellis said she didn't have time because she was working. When Richard showed up with food for her, she immediately started eating it. Meredith later had to break the news to Ellis that Richard wouldn't be visiting her anymore because he'd decided to commit himself back to his marriage. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nWhile reliving the first time Richard left her, she had to be reminded that it had happened thirty years prior. ''(\"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\")''\n\n\nOne morning, Ellis woke up in her nursing home completely lucid. She remembered everything except the last five years and the fact that she had Alzheimer's. [[Ms. Henry]] thought it was best that Meredith tell her about the Alzheimer's. Ellis apologized to Meredith for the fight they'd had and tried to figure out why she was in a home. Meredith told her she had Alzheimer's and that she lived in a residential facility. Ellis started to cry and then collapsed and had to be rushed to the hospital. They ran tests to determine the cause of her arrhythmias. Because she was in the Alzheimer's research trial, she asked for a consult with the neurosurgeon who got her into the trial. When she met with Derek, she figured out that Meredith was seeing him. Ellis was diagnosed with a heart condition that could be treated with meds, but Burke decided to do surgery because Meredith said she's often not compliant with medication. She tried to refuse the surgery, but since Meredith was her medical proxy, it wasn't Ellis's decision to make. Meredith said she wouldn't let Ellis refuse the surgery because she said killing her mother wouldn't be another thing that happened to her. During her last lucid moments, she reminisced with Richard about the life they could have had together. Meredith came back and told Ellis that she still hoped they'd find a cure and the two of them would have another chance to get to know each other, but by then, she wasn't lucid anymore. ''(\"[[Wishin' and Hopin']]\")''\n\n\nEllis became agitated and aggressive, so she was given lorazepam to calm her down. Later that day, she coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith's Near-Death Experience\nWhen Meredith drowned in [[Elliott Bay]], she saw her mother in a sort of afterlife, saying she didn't belong there. She said that Meredith was anything but ordinary before telling her to run. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\nAshes\nShe was later cremated, put into a beautiful urn, and for a time was \"hanging out in the back of Meredith's closet.\" ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\nBecause Meredith thought that Ellis' ashes were haunting her, she took them to work and washed them down a surgical sink at the hospital with [[Richard Webber|Richard]], who saw it as a fitting tribute for her final resting place to be so closely associated with the hospital which she dedicated her life to. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\nDay of the Dead\nEllis was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\nMeredith's Dream\nEllis appeared to Meredith in a dream, first giving constructive criticism to Maggie about her article and then telling Zola an idea for Meredith and having her write it down. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\nMeredith's Next Dream\nEllis appeared to Meredith in another dream years later, asking Meredith what she was going to do next after surviving the unbelievable. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nTaunting Meredith\nEllis appeared in another of Meredith's dreams, taunting her about her surgical skills. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\n\nIn the alternate universe, Ellis never developed Alzheimer's, Richard chose her instead of Adele, and they raised Meredith together. Ellis is also Chief of Surgery and Chief of Staff at Seattle Grace. ''(\"[[If/Then]]\")''\n\n\nShe was extremely overbearing, intense, arrogant, driven, determined, and hardworking.\n\n\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\n[[File:xEllisRichardFlashback.jpg|thumb|right|px|Richard leaves Ellis for Adele.]]\nDuring her residency, she had an affair with former [[Seattle Grace Hospital|SGH]] Chief of [[Surgery]], [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]], when they were both residents. As residents, the two doctors had a defining moment in both their careers and their relationship when they took care of one of the first patients diagnosed with G.R.I.D. (Gay-related immune deficiency, an early name for AIDS).\n\nLate in their relationship, Ellis became pregnant by Richard. She gave [[Maggie Pierce|the baby]] up for adoption at birth.\n\nEllis decided to slit her wrists in front of Meredith and forbade her to call an ambulance. When her mother passed out Meredith rang an ambulance and her mother lived. Years later, with the help of her psychiatrist, Meredith realized that her mother wasn't trying to commit suicide, she cut her wrists in the hopes that Richard would find out and take her back. However, Richard never heard about the incident and she was too stubborn to ask.\n\n[[Thatcher Grey]]\nShe was married to [[Thatcher Grey]], who left the family when Meredith was young, partly as a result of Ellis's affair. Ellis and Richard planned to leave their respective partners and get married but eventually, Richard chose Adele over Ellis, although he did still have feelings for her.\n\n\nShe describes her mother as the quintessential housewife. She made sure everything was perfect, but that didn't stop her father from sleeping with all his secretaries. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\n[[Marie Cerone]]\nEllis and Marie were great friends for years until they had a falling out. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nMeredith learned that Ellis and Marie had worked together on what won Ellis's second Harper Avery, the Ellis Grey Procedure, but Ellis had taken all the credit. Many years later, Marie wanted Meredith to publicly make it known that the work was not just Ellis's. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")''\n\n\n[[Elizabeth Fallon]]\nLiz Fallon was Ellis's scrub nurse for  years. When Liz was dying of cancer, Meredith went to see her. During the visit Liz made a comment about Ellis's perfect memory and Meredith couldn't stop laughing, so Liz asked what Ellis was diagnosed with. Shocked, Meredith ended up telling Liz about Ellis's Alzheimer's. Liz revealed that while she'd been Ellis's scrub nurse, she never met Meredith. When Meredith mentioned meeting Liz, Ellis remembered her fondly, that she was a great scrub nurse, asking how she was. ''(\"[[No Man's Land]]\")''\n\nIt is unclear when those  years occurred as Liz Fallon worked at Seattle Grace and Ellis left Seattle after her residency and later worked at Mass Gen, The Mayo Clinic and for the U.N. It has been strongly implied that she never returned to work at Seattle Grace.\n\n\n[[File:Ellissaysgoodbye.jpg|thumb|left|px|Ellis tells Meredith to be extraordinary.]]\nEllis completed her [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She was the only female in her residency class. During her residency, along with [[Richard Webber]], she treated and identified the hospital's first GRID (now known as AIDS) patient. During her final year of residency, Ellis created an audacious laparoscopic technique to treat gallbladders and subsequently named it, audaciously, \"The Grey Method\" when it was published in The American Journal of Medicine. She listed herself as the first author, and it put her on the short list for her first Harper Avery nomination. The nomination itself was groundbreaking as no resident ever had been nominated.\n\nShe later developed the \"Ellis Grey Procedure,\" where she worked very closely with her colleague and then-best friend, [[Marie Cerone]]. According to Marie, she and Ellis developed the procedure together. It was a laparoscopic biliary reconstruction. The procedure was nominated for and later won a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], Ellis' second and final win. Marie, however, did not receive any credit for her contribution because when the time came to publishing the paper, Ellis left Marie's name off of it and listed only herself. Ellis did this due to the fact that Marie was blacklisted from ever being eligible to win a Harper Avery. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")''\n\nYears later, and following Harper Avery's own death, Ellis' daughter, Meredith announced during a public presentation of her own research that the procedure, which she referred to as the \"Grey Method,\" would now be known as the \"Grey-Cerone Method\" to acknowledge Marie's contributions. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")'' \n\nAfter her divorce with Thatcher and break-up with Richard, Ellis moved with Meredith to pursue a [[Fellow|fellowship]] position at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She then won the Harper Avery and dedicated the win to all the female surgeons in the world that would come after her. Ellis continued to be a pioneer in surgery as her distinguished career included tenures at [[Boston General]], the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota and for the U.N., and won another Harper Avery award.\n\nShe has also documented a significant aspect of her surgical training, in the form of videos, which were watched while the group were still interns, and in her [[Ellis Grey's Journals|journals]], writing about her relationship with Richard and her surgical training, referencing staff at Seattle Grace, such as [[Margaret Campbell]], and which Cristina greatly enjoys, for both medicine and romance. According to her journals, the decision of whether or not Ellis would get the first solo surgery was the greatest and most terrifying moment in her life.\n\nEllis wrote at least one book, as Richard supposed she took time off to write another one.

However, when a paperwork snafu held Dr. Safavi up at the airport, Frances struggled to get off the plane. Owen brought a blood donation kit to the airplane, but Frances refused to have her blood drawn on the plane because she feared something would go wrong. She still struggled with getting off the plane, so Owen set up a video call with Gus's mom, who talked to her and explained why Gus needed her blood so badly. Frances was then able to allow Owen to carry her to the car while she was covered with a blanket.

''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-op, Ivy's indices were good and she was recovering well. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLater, Ivy spiked a fever. Cristina took her to the OR for a biopsy, which revealed that she was rejecting her donor heart. They treated it with anti-rejection medication and put Ivy back on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well.

She, too, was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. The doctors inserted a pacemaker. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks after her pacemaker was inserted, Frankie was doing well, even walking around the hospital. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nWhile playing Hide and Seek with [[Braden Morris]], Frankie collapsed in a hallway. When she was found, her pulse was weak and she wasn't breathing well. She was taken into surgery to insert an LVAD and then she was put on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nFrankie's LVAD failed to reverse the heart damage, which left her in desperate need of a heart. One became available, but when they transplanted it, they discovered that it had been damaged during retrieval and couldn't keep her alive. When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting in Frankie\us room while the doctors talked to his parents, Link started to cough up pink fluid just as Frankie had. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nLink was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and declined quickly. They attempted to put him on a Berlin Heart, but he was clotting too much. They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLink's heart pump worked well, keeping him stable as he waited for a heart transplant.

Sabine was relieved that it wasn't something in their house or something she had done.

Despite this, she continued to live her life as a boy into adulthood, when she finally decided she wanted to live her life as her true self and be happy.\n\n\nRosalind went with her brother, Ben, after their father died to spread his ashes at a place where they frequently camped together, at his request.\n\n\nAfter his ashes were spread, Rosalind and Ben raced back up a hill. At the top of the hill, Rosalind was winded and eventually collapsed. She was rushed to the ER, where she refused to cooperate with the doctors, insisting that she was fine despite evidence to the contrary. A test revealed an enlarged spleen, which had to be removed, so [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] scheduled surgery to do that, but Meredith was also concerned about Rosalind's hormones levels because she appeared male, but had the hormone levels of a young woman. She eventually admitted that she was starting to take hormones to live life as a woman.\n\nWhile waiting for her surgery, Rosalind started to cough up blood from a bleeding esophagus, which was caused by the off-shelf hormones she'd been taking. She was rushed into surgery to repair the bleeding and remove her spleen. After her surgery, her brother continued to reject her as a woman, asking why she didn't tell him sooner, as they've been close since they were kids. She tried to explain, but Ben stormed out.\n\n[[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] brought [[Jackson Avery]] in for a plastics consult. Jackson introduced himself and asked for her name, saying he didn't figure she was sticking with Curtis. She told him she had chosen Rosalind and Jackson asked if he could call her that and then explained to her the steps for a healthy transition, saying the off-shelf hormones were done and anything she puts into her body is approved and regulated by the hospital from now on. And he also told her it was time to start seeing a therapist again. ''(\"[[The Great Pretender]]\")''\n\n\nWhen an earthquake struck Seattle, Ben was initially reluctant to call his sister because they still hadn't spoken after she came out to him. However, after spending the day working with [[Jackson Avery]], Ben called Rosalind, who had a bookshelf fall at her home, but was okay. ''(\"[[I Feel the Earth Move]]\")''\n\n\nAt the start of the COVID- pandemic, Rosalind came to live at her brother's house to watch their sons while Ben and Bailey both quarantined due to their work. Both boys enjoyed this change and wanted Rosalind to continue to stay with them. Rosalind brought them down to the hospital one evening to clap for the healthcare workers at the hospital along with the firefighters of station . ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")'' ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")'' \n\nWhen Bailey's mother died, Rosalind was there when Ben broke the news to Tuck. She helped Ben to understand that him lashing out at Ben wasn't personal and was merely an artifact of his grief. She encouraged Ben to help him process his grief and talk about his feelings, unlike how he had dealt with his grief when his own mother died when he was a little older than Tuck. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd, protests cropped around the country, including many in Seattle. Joey and Tuck asked Ben if they could join the protests, saying they wanted to march for themselves and for Rosalind. Rosalind said she'd take the lead from Ben. Ben finally agreed and they marched along the rest of Station . ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station )|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n\nRosalind attended the party Ben and Bailey threw at the station for Pru. ''(\"[[Crawl Out Through the Fallout]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Ben Warren]]\nRosalind is close to her brother, Ben. They shared a room for most of their lives, even into adulthood. Their relationship was strained when Rosalind came out to Ben as transgender. However, they have since rekindled their relationship and Rosalind even lived with Ben for a while. \n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nRosalind gets along well with her sister-in-law, Miranda, who in turn says that Rosalind is a sweetheart.

''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\nHe was examined the next day by [[Callie Torres]] and he told her he didn't sleep well overnight because his wife was nervous about her own surgery and kept him up. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Rob was in surgery, Jen had a seizure and an MRI revealed an aneurysm, for which they scheduled surgery. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\nThe next day, when she was supposed to have her surgery, it was instead postponed. At the end of the day, Jen begged not to be forced to wait another day, so Derek took her into surgery late at night. He clipped the aneurysm, but Jen was unstable after surgery and he had to be brought back in. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\nJen had difficulty breathing. Derek then consulted with Addison on the case. Addison suggested that the baby could be the problem. They did a doppler and found that the baby was anemic and Jen was mirroring. After running more tests, which showed that the baby was in heart failure, Addison said it was likely due to the blood Jen had gotten during her first surgery being incompatible with the baby. Addison said ideally, she'd do an in utero blood transfusion, but this wasn't ideal. She instead suggested delivering the baby to save Jen's life. Jen declined and said she wanted to wait two weeks to give him a better chance. They asked for another option, so Derek mentioned the transfusion, despite Addison saying it was too risky. Jen insisted that she wanted it. Addison did the transfusion successfully. ''(\"[[Ex-Life]]\")''\n\nJen had to be taken back into surgery in order to stop the mini-strokes she was having. Before her surgery, Rob privately asked that if it came down to a choice between Jen or the baby, to choose Jen. Her surgery was successful, but Jen developed pre-eclampsia. Her patch blew and she had to be rushed back into surgery. In that surgery, Jen died after Derek removed huge portions of her brain to try to save her. Right before she was pronounced dead, Addison delivered her son. Rob was devastated to hear that Jen had died. ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe was married to [[Jen Harmon]] until her death. He proposed to her in a supermarket aisle because that's where he first saw her. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\nWhen Jen died, Rob was devastated. ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\n\nRob and Jen's son was delivered during her final surgery.

While out in the hallway to get tests, he met up with [[Jackson Prescott]], who asked him what he did wrong. William lied and said it was a traffic violation and then offered his organs when Jackson said he needed a new liver and intestine. He later spoke to Meredith about her allowing him to die. Right before he went unconscious, he begged Meredith just to let him die, so she refused to be the second physician's signature to authorize his surgery. When he woke up after his surgery, he asked why Derek just didn't let him die. Derek told him that he didn't get a choice of how to die, just like the women he killed. Later that night, Meredith, knowing that he was a match for Jackson Prescott and that Jackson had had a failed transplant, went to him and told him that they'd taken his skull cap off, leaving his brain vulnerable. Once Meredith left the room, he started to bash his head into the top of his hospital bed. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\")''\n[[File:WilliamDunnDying.jpg|thumb|left|px|William attempts to die.]]\nWilliam started seizing and Meredith paged Bailey instead of Derek. She told Bailey that William was a match for Jackson. Bailey told her to keep her patient alive, because they're doctors, not executioners. When his condition started to worsen and he had trouble breathing, Meredith reminded him he could stop at any time and she'd page Derek. Cristina eventually came in to examine him and he begged her to help him, saying he didn't want to die. She paged Derek and William was rushed to surgery.\n\nHis surgery was interrupted by [[Miranda Bailey]] who, after hearing that Dunn's organs were a match for Jackson, asked Derek to put down the scalpel and let Dunn die. Shepherd allowed her to choose if he lived or died. Realizing the nature of what she was asking, she couldn't let him die, and told Derek to continue and swiftly left.\n[[File:Dunn'sexecution.jpg|thumb|left|px|Dunn's execution.]]\nAfter the surgery, William told Meredith he had been playing her the whole time. She said he was scared because death is scary. He then asked if she could attend his execution so he could at least see one friendly face in the crowd.\n\n\nMeredith attended William's execution at [[Caldwell Correctional Facility]].

My whole life and I think I need to see everything that's not in a hospital. I need to travel and explore and hike and breathe, and breathe...and breathe. Breathe real air. So deep, I want to breathe it all in. Away from the monitors, and the blood, and the sterile gowns, away from saving other people's lives. I want my own. It's time I live my own. You changed my life, Dr. Webber. You taught me how to take my past and find my path. Thank you.|'''Stephanie Edwards''' to '''[[Richard Webber]]'''}}\n\n'''Stephanie Edwards''' was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] until she quit to explore and travel after an explosion in the hospital caused her significant burns.\n\n\n\nStephanie was born with Sickle-Cell Disease. At the age of five, she was put in a clinical trial at [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|St. Jude]] that used bone marrow transplants to treat the disease. The treatment was very effective for her and [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Old Time and Rock and Roll|Dr. Keith Wagner]], who ran the study, called Stephanie one of the most successful stories from the trial. Her memory of the trial is resisting and being told it was for her own good. There were even times when they had to strap her down to get her to accept the treatment.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\n\nStephanie started her internship at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] shortly after the [[Flight|plane crash]]. She, along with the other interns, quickly learned to fear [[Meredith Grey]], dubbing her Medusa.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working on the case of [[Graham Cunningham]], Cristina allowed Stephanie the opportunity to do a procedure, even saying that Stephanie was better than Shane. When Bailey stepped in, Cristina backed off, but then ultimately decided to let Stephanie close, over Bailey's objections.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n\nWhile competing with Leah while they were both on [[Cristina Yang|Cristina's]] service, they both were indefinitely banned from the OR when their fighting led to Leah hooking up a [[Mrs. Crossley|patient's]] oxygen to her IV, a potentially fatal mistake.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n\nWhen it seemed like the hospital was going to be sold, Stephanie started looking at programs at other hospitals because she wanted to be the best and to be the best, she had to learn at the best program.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Heather died, the other interns were given time off. Derek told them to think of happy Heather stories for her mother, but they realized they didn't have any as they were not very close to her. They went to Meredith and she told them a story about George stealing jello for all of them, a story she had shared with George's mother when he died. They used alcohol from Alex to get drunk and bond, but when Heather's mother arrived, they still didn't have a story to tell her, so they stole Meredith's George story, as well as using a question Stephanie had asked Jo and changing it to involve Heather. Using their newfound bond, the four of them went out to the pile as a group to help.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the interns began all sleeping at Alex's house and studying. Jo was waiting for Alex to proposition her so they could have sex and Alex was waiting because he thought she was still grieving, so he said they could stay there as long as they wanted. Jo went to the others and said that they needed to leave. <ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\n\nThe day before Halloween, Stephanie had LASIK eye surgery. She came back to work right away rather than taking the two days off that were recommended. She spent the day running into things. At the end of the day, Jackson told her that he had planned to take the day off with her and take care of her. She asked if they could do it the next day, but he said they'd do it now and took her home.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\n\nStephanie worked with Meredith as she started her portal vein trial. After siding with Alex over Meredith in a surgery, Meredith didn't want to work with Stephanie anymore.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\nStephanie operated with Meredith when she put the first printed portal vein in a sheep. The surgery was successful, but the sheep later died.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith hired a bioengineer to work on the portal vein trial with her, Stephanie was assigned to watch him as he read all the research materials and not allow him to touch the printer. When he doodled something that Stephanie found interesting, she asked him how it would work. Stephanie went to Meredith to ask for permission for [[Eric Block]] to use the printer, but Meredith denied permission. However, Meredith later came back to the lab to find them using the printer. Meredith said that she really wanted to work to get her trial off the ground.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\n\nStephanie was confused when April invited her to her and Matthew's wedding, as she expected to be Jackson's guest. However, Jackson was not invited because of his past with April, and inviting Stephanie was April's way of getting Jackson there. Stephanie believed that Jackson and April weren't really over each other because if they were, they would be congratulating each other. Despite this, Jackson assured her that there was nothing going on with them and that they could go to the wedding. <ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nApril told Jackson that she wanted him to be there, so Stephanie and Jackson attended the wedding. However, Jackson stood up at the wedding, and confessed his love for April, effectively ending his relationship with Stephanie.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\nStephanie walked out of the hospital that night. Three weeks later, Leah and Jo were surprised to see her back finally, though she claimed she wasn't in hiding. She avoided interacting with Jackson. However, when her patient, [[Robert Fischer]], expressed desire to undo the changes he'd made to his body to look like a cat, she went to Jackson and asked him to fix Robert's face pro bono.\n\nShe talked to Leah about how hard it was to be around Jackson and how she knew that dating him was a bad idea, but she did it anyway. Leah told Stephanie that it was Jackson's fault because he was her boss and he chose to date her and then he chose to toss her aside like Arizona had done with her and Cristina had done with Shane. She said it was awful and that someone should do something about it.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen the non-fraternization policy was introduced, Jo immediately assumed that Stephanie had filed the claim that led to the policy being enacted although it was really Leah Murphy.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAfter hitting both Arizona and Jackson with gurneys in the same day, Stephanie had to go to HR to fill out an accident report. Jackson was in there at the same time filling out his own paperwork about the incident. Jackson told her that he didn't plan what he did at the wedding. He apologized for it and said he didn't know how to make it better. Stephanie said he couldn't. She got looks of pity, something she'd never had before. But she was done feeling bad about it. To her, he just existed and she didn't care about him at all.<ref>[[Throwing it All Away]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of who had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAt Richard's birthday party, Owen asked him to be the director of the residency program because he noticed how well he'd been mentoring the residents.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Shane was worried that he was sick, Stephanie took over the conduit patients for the day in exchange for him taking her weekend calls for a month and being her swap monkey for two months.<ref>[[You Be Illin']], x</ref>\n\nWhen Stephanie got bored watching Bailey look through options, she pulled swap monkey on Shane and sent him to work with her while she printed sample conduits for Cristina's trial. However, when Shane ended up in surgery instead, Stephanie tried to call swap monkey to switch back. She tried again to swap to go back to Bailey after surgery and ended up chasing Shane down the hall.<ref>[[I'm Winning]], x</ref>\n\nDerek, warned that he wasn't teaching enough, took all the residents to work on a case with him that he had rescheduled several times. As the OR wasn't available until  AM, he then took them to the ER to work on the incoming patients, including having them work on a patient who was already dead so they could work with real brain tissue. When a man came in with scissors puncturing his forehead, they took him into an OR for a controlled extraction. Then they went back to the case of [[Nova Jenkins]]. Each of the residents took a turn to step up to the microscope and ask a question so they could learn.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nStephanie worked with Bailey on the case of [[Braden Morris]], who was born with SCID, which left him vulnerable to illness. His parents consented to them using de-activated HIV as a vector to deliver an enzyme to his body, but before the procedure could be done, his mother withdrew consent. Despite this, Bailey proceeded with the procedure, desperate to prove that her research would help people.<ref>[[Change of Heart]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Braden's t-cell count jumped overnight, Stephanie confronted Bailey about it and Bailey confirmed to her that she had done the treatment without consent.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Bailey came clean to the parents, Bailey and Stephanie were both involved in legal meetings. When the parents announced their intent to sue and get Bailey's medical license revoked as well as charging her with assault and battery, Stephanie took the blame, saying that she didn't tell Bailey that the parents had revoked consent and Bailey was covering for her. They dropped the charges and Stephanie was suspended for a week.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n\nPer Eliza Minnick's instructions, Stephanie went to counseling, but she returned to work after only a few sessions with Richard's support. On her first day back, she and [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] treated [[Keith]], who was brought in along with [[Alison Goodman]] after the car they were in drove off a cliff. Since both were partially undressed, the doctors assumed them to be a couple who were making out. Eliza punished Stephanie for quitting counseling and left her to monitor Keith, who had a liver lac. When they were alone, Keith begged Stephanie to take him to go see Alison. She agreed to his request, while the other doctors found out through Alison that Keith is a stranger who got in her car and tried to rape her. [[Hannah Brody|Intern Hannah]] came across Stephanie and informed her that a patient had been raped, oblivious to the fact that Keith was said, rapist. As soon as she was gone, Keith pressed Stephanie against a wall and threatened her with a scalpel. He demanded that she take him out of the hospital without anyone seeing. They came across Ben, but Stephanie convinced him she was just helping her patient get back on his feet.\n\nAs they entered the stairwell, Keith dragged her through a door as he heard security approaching. They ended up near a lab and as Keith wanted to enter the stairwell again, they found out the doors wouldn't open because of a lockdown initiated by Bailey. To make matters worse, they were trapped with [[Erin Miller]], a child who had been wandering the hospital all day. Figuring that a fire would override the lockdown, Keith gathered supplies to start a fire while Stephanie protected Erin. As Keith was busy holding a burning towel up to the sprinklers, Stephanie seized the opportunity and sprayed Keith with hand alcohol. Burning fibers fell down and lit Keith on fire. Stephanie shut herself and Erin into the nearest room, but quickly realized that Keith's burning body fell just a few inches from the oxygen tanks in the adjacent room. Stephanie quickly went to drag him away, but the tanks burst right before she could stop it. <ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref>\n\nStephanie recovered from the blast in the burning lab as Erin was calling her name. Erin's leg was trapped under a machine. Stephanie created a path through the flames towards Erin. She used lab supplies to tie off the blood supply to the wound and clamped the vessel. She helped Erin get up. When their path was blocked by flames, Stephanie wet a blanket and her hair at the sink, picked up Erin, and jumped through the flames with the blanket wrapped around them. They entered the stairwell and discovered the floors beneath them were on fire already. They slowly went up, with Stephanie supporting Erin. Upon reaching the door to the roof, Stephanie discovered her key card was gone. Since they were trapped by the ascending fire, Stephanie sat down with Erin and wrapped her in the blanket to give her the best chance of surviving and accepted her own fate. However, as Stephanie glanced down at floors engulfed in flames below her, she spotted her badge on the floor through the smoke. She went to retrieve it, and they accessed the roof. No one on the ground heard her cries for help and Erin suddenly coded. Stephanie started CPR and was still doing so when Ben and the firefighters finally found them.\n\nShe and Erin were taken to the ER since the OR floor was inaccessible due to the damage. She yelled at Eliza to get out of her face and stayed with Erin when Richard and Bailey operated right there. With Erin finally stable and her leg saved, Stephanie's body finally shut down. She was taken to the burn unit for the severe burns on her arms. Richard came to visit her. While telling her that she was gonna be all right, but it would be a while until she could perform surgery, Stephanie, who was still traumatized by the whole incident, said that due to the fact she had spent her whole life in hospitals, she thought she should go anywhere that was not the inside of a hospital and wanted to travel, explore, hike, and breathe away from the monitors, blood, and sterile gowns. She concluded that she was done saving other people's lives and she wanted to go out and live her own life, away from the hospital. She thanked Richard for changing her life and teaching her how to take her past and find her path and that now she has found it. She quit and then told Andrew to turn up the morphine to stop the pain. Richard stayed and accompanied her while Andrew turned up the morphine as Stephanie was calming down.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\nThe day after the fire, she was airlifted to a burn unit in Texas to continue her recovery. Bailey later revealed to the owner of the hospital, Harper Avery that her bravery during the incident has been all over the news. <ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\n\n\nHer grandmother used to say that everyone is their own kind of crazy and that the secret to finding love is to find the person whose crazy complements your own.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\n[[April Kepner|April]] set her up as [[Jackson Avery|Jackson's]] date to [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey's]] wedding.\uaThey missed the ceremony, so\ua[[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] suggested he just take her home. She misinterpreted, letting him know she did not want to sleep with her boss.\uaThey both agreed that sleeping together would be a mistake, but\uaended up having sex\uaright there in the car anyway.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nThey initially kept things quiet because Stephanie didn't want anyone thinking she was sleeping with her boss to get ahead.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\nThey began seeing each other.\ua[[Jackson Avery|Jackson]]\uastated it was just sex, whereas Stephanie believed it was more serious than that because she stated that she would follow him if\uahe were to move and get a job somewhere else.\n\nWhen Jackson's mother came to town to see him, he sent Stephanie away so that his mother wouldn't interrogate her.<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\nWhen his new role as board director started to interfere with their relationship, as he began to forget dates, she asked him why he'd been standing her up and demanded to be treated better. He kissed her and she stopped talking.<ref>[[Do You Believe in Magic]], x</ref>\n\nThe night of the fundraising gala, Stephanie was mad at Jackson because he didn't invite her to go with him because he believed that she didn't want to go. After working closely with Shane on a group of junkies while covering the ER, Shane kissed her, which Jackson saw. He fled back to the gala, but she followed him. They fought and Stephanie explained what had happened, so they made up.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson's mother came back to [[Seattle]] to visit Richard, Stephanie met her when she burst into the on-call room where Jackson and Stephanie were making out, giving his mother a bad impression of her. While they worked on a patient with an enlarged penis together, Catherine continued to tease Stephanie. Later, at the bar, Stephanie talked to Catherine about what had happened.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nStephanie went to April's wedding with Jackson. During the ceremony, Jackson stood up and confess his love for April, thus ending his relationship with Stephanie.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n[[Kyle Diaz]]\nKyle heavily flirted with\uaStephanie\uaduring his hospitalization.<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref>\n\nShe agreed to text him during his tour and said they might be able to go out when he got back. They ended up exchanging dirty texts.<ref>[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Kyle came back into town, he asked Stephanie to go out with him. She tried to decline, worried that what they had was all texts, but he showed up at the hospital and she agreed to go with him when he said he wanted to take her somewhere special. She went with him to a recording studio, where they started to kiss and then undress.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], x</ref>\n\nThey continued to see each other, though without labeling their relationship. When Kyle developed a tremor in his other hand, Stephanie told him to go to the hospital, where she stayed by his side as he waited for surgery and waited in the waiting room while he was in surgery. After his surgery, she came to visit him before he woke up and left a note ending things between them.<ref>[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]], x</ref>\n\nHe came back to the ER with meningitis.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref> While he was there, he refused to see Stephanie or having her involved in his case. He later died in surgery.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nJo and Stephanie met on the first day of their internship and became friends. Their only huge argument was when Jo accused Stephanie of lying about being sick as a child and Stephanie eventually forgave Jo.\n\n\nShe was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. While on [[Cristina Yang|Cristina Yang's]] service, she\uagot reprimanded for\uaaccidentally almost killing a patient and\uawas banned from the O.R. until further notice, a ban which has since expired. She's often on [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia Shepherd's]] service, after which she was recruited for [[Nicole Herman|Nicole Herman's]] brain surgery, who had a practically inoperable tumor.<ref>[[Staring at the End]], x</ref> The surgery was successful, inspiring Stephanie to become a neurosurgeon. She worked closely together for Amelia in the following years. When Amelia took a drink and wasn't allowed to work, Stephanie, as a fifth-year resident, kept her service going. She later quit following the hospital explosion, saying she wanted to explore and live her life.\n\n\n*Edwards proclaimed that [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital|Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's]] [[General Surgery|surgical program]] was the [[Resident|residency-match]] to get.\n*She was captain of her high school cheer team for three years.\n*She went to college on a cheerleading scholarship.\n*Stephanie had laser eye surgery because \"glasses are annoying.\" She returned to work early and, because her eyes had not healed up yet, she strained them and spent the day struggling to see.\ua\n*Stephanie dressed up as a clown for\ua[[Thriller|Halloween]].\n*She has a thing for karaoke.\n*Stephanie sheds hair easily and is known to leave her many bras lying around.\n*She uses lavender-scented shampoo.\n*During her [[Resident|residency]], Edwards has shown an aptitude for several [[Specialties|specialties]] including [[Neurosurgery|neuro]], [[General Surgery|general]], [[Fetal Surgery|fetal]], and [[Urology|urology]].

He developed a romantic relationship with [[Meredith Grey]]. He was the younger brother of [[Carina DeLuca]].\n\n\n\nAndrew was born and raised in Italy. His father, also a surgeon, used to take him and his sister Carina out fishing. While in a manic episode, his father operated on seven people in a row without food or sleep and lost four of his patients. Because of his connections, he got away with it, but Andrew's mother left him over it. She then took a young Andrew with her and moved to the United States, while his father and Carina stayed in Italy.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref> At some point, his mother went back to visit his sister in Italy. While she was there, he received a call from Carina that their mother had gotten sick and that he needed to get there as soon as possible. When he arrived, he learned his mother had died even before the call, but Carina couldn't handle telling him that over the phone as she wanted to be able to hug him after delivering the bad news.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nRight after high school, Andrew worked as an EMT. He said he loved it and it's what made him decide to go to medical school. His second call out was an MVC. He arrived to find a woman in the front seat bleeding from her neck. He was trying to stop the bleeding, but she was wailing, holding her dead toddler in her arms. That's when he decided not to go into peds.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\nWhile living on the East Coast, he met [[Sam Bello]] and they had a tumultuous, on-and-off-again relationship. When they broke up, she wouldn't return his calls. In an attempt to get her attention, he kidnapped her dog, so she broke into his apartment to get it back. He then moved across the country to the West Coast without telling her goodbye, so she blocked him on all social media and they didn't hear from each other for years.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn his way to his first day as an intern, Andrew came across the tunnel collapse. When [[Joan Paulson]] was extracted, he rode in with her in the ambulance. When they ran out of splints, he used his tie to stabilize her wrist. After Joan was taken into the hospital, he asked if he needed to fill out paperwork, but Owen, not knowing Andrew is an intern, said that he could do it later if he was okay jumping in and continuing to help.\n\nAndrew was forced to admit that he was only an intern when Joan's neck dislocated and he didn't know how to help Stephanie fix it.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the doctors realized they'd need to get [[Keith Gardner]] to an OR quickly so he wouldn't bleed to death, Andrew, along with the other interns, was posted along the path to clear the way. He then rounded out his first day by rounding on [[Joan Paulson]], who was by then stable and expected to make a full recovery.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nBecause the other interns believed he had posed as an attending on purpose, they didn't want to live with him or be friends with him, so when [[Arizona Robbins]] posted about having a room available to rent, he jumped at the chance. She was initially suspicious, but said they could work it out, and they eventually became friends shortly after.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew attended [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] anatomy class.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Jade Bell collapsed and came to the hospital, Andrew wanted to page neuro after they stitched up her head. Later, when she collapsed in the hospital, Andrew was quick to take a door off its hinges to use as a backboard.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\n\nSeeing that the interns weren't well-trained in delivering bad news to patient families, [[Owen Hunt]] insisted that they all be trained. He taught them the four Ls (Location, language, body language, and leave) and informed them that they'd be telling the families of the people who died in the ER that day.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Andrew was helping Jo get into bed after a night of drinking, Alex walked in and saw Andrew on top of her. Assuming that Andrew was sexually assaulting her, Alex violently physically assaulted Andrew, leading to the former temporarily injuring his hand and the latter sustaining several critical injuries.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew decided to press charges, Alex and his attorney thought it was for a misdemeanor, but quickly learned that the state had upped the charge to felony assault. Alex pled not guilty.\n\nLater, Alex went to the District Attorney's office to take a plea deal, but Andrew unexpectedly walked in and tried to drop all charges against Alex. When he was told that since the case belonged to the state, he could not do that, he threatened to sabotage the case, which the attorney said was \"a slam dunk.\" Andrew walked out before Alex could understand why he decided to drop the charges. The two eventually had a conversation outside of the hospital in which Andrew says that he did it to protect Jo, and expressed frustration that Alex never apologized when he had the chance.\n\n\nAndrew grew concerned over Amelia when he witnessed her diving into [[Beau Martinez|Beau Martinez']] case and ignoring Owen and Megan. He tried to voice those concerns to Jo at Joe's, but she thought he wanted to talk about the two of them dating. He then left the bar and went home, where he found his sister about to have sex with Arizona.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref> After arguing in Italian, Andrew decided he would sleep at the hospital. Carina, knowing that Andrew worked for a female chief of surgery, asked him to introduce her to Bailey and got permission from her to conduct research for her study involving scanning the female orgasm using an MRI at Grey Sloan. Andrew tried to talk Amelia out of operating on Beau given the fact that it could cause more harm, but she persisted.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Carina show Amelia her tumor.]]\nDuring the surgery, Amelia made Andrew get Jackson, forcing him to help despite his refusal to participate in the risky surgery earlier. Afterwards, Jackson told them they got lucky when the surgery turned out successful. Later, when Andrew went to talk to Carina about conducting her research at the hospital he worked at, they found that the current study subject had a brain tumor in her frontal lobe. It was Amelia's.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew has to keep Amelia's tumor a secret while she and Tom plan its removal.]]\nFor a week, Amelia told Andrew to keep her tumor a secret, which he felt uncomfortable about doing. Amelia called her old teacher, [[Tom Koracick]], to come and perform the surgery. While Amelia had another scan, she directed Andrew to gather all of her recent case files for her to go over in case any mistakes were made on her part. Later, Andrew tried to tell Maggie about the tumor by talking to her about their failed relationship in a room with Amelia's brain scans shown throughout the room, hoping Maggie would notice, but she did not. Later, Amelia told her herself.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nDuring Amelia's surgery, Andrew assisted Koracick with the removal of the tumor. Prior to the surgery, Andrew, Amelia, and Tom did the superhero pose together. He tried to ask questions about the procedure, which Amelia had suggested to make Koracick work faster, but he was ignored by Koracick, who was singing to music while operating and told Andrew to either sing or shut up. The surgery was successful and during her recovery, Andrew used early ambulation on Amelia.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew checks on Amelia as she recovers.]]\nKoracick tried to order Andrew to stop as he witnessed her struggle, but Andrew continued, saying that this was Amelia's treatment and that she had ordered him to do it no matter what and to ignore Koracick if he told him to stop. Koracick told Andrew that if anything happened, it was his fault. After Amelia recovered, she asked Andrew to run more scans, because she felt that there was something wrong. To ease her concerns, Andrew brought Amelia the removed tumor and showed it to her. He told her that the reason why she felt something was wrong was because for a long time, there was in fact something wrong, but now there wasn't anymore and that, for her, could feel wrong. She realized he was right and hugged him.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew joins the other men to hang out on Jackson's boat.]]\nJackson invited Andrew to come hang with him and the other men on his newly purchased boat. He asked Andrew to pick up food since they would be grilling. Andrew met them on the boat with several big fish. Jackson organized a fish filleting contest, which Andrew turned out to be good, as he had learned it from his father when he took him and Carina fishing. When Jackson brought up his new apartment, Andrew said he would be looking for a place soon with Sofia moving back to Seattle. Owen then invited him to come live with him for a while. Soon after, the attendings were paged for the intern mixer, leaving Andrew to clean up their mess. Afterwards, he went to the hospital and found Arizona. He told her he would be staying with Owen, after which they saw Carina and Owen kiss. He couldn't believe she was sleeping with another friend of his and opted against moving in with Owen. Later, he came across the new batch of interns and learned that his ex-girlfriend [[Sam Bello]] was one of them.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nGiven their tumultuous history, Andrew ignored her at work. When she confronted him about it, he reminded her of their history and said they only hurt each other when they get together. He thought she followed him to Seattle, but she denied that. Sam had to get burn supplies but she didn't know where to get them, so Ben made Andrew show her. They diverted and ended up having sex in the skills lab. They were caught by Bailey and Webber. When Carina found out, she reminded Andrew that he and Sam were not healthy together. He later ran into her in an on-call room. She went to leave, but he stopped her and asked her to swear she hadn't followed him to Seattle. She told him they were bad for each other. However, they ended up making out again.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nThey had sex everywhere in the hospital all the time, so everybody knew. When the hospital was hacked, Richard taught Andrew some old-school tricks to treat his patients without modern technology.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> Sam started to spiral when the hackers turned up the heat in the hospital. Richard asked Andrew to keep her away from patients. Andrew tried to recuse himself, so Richard revealed he knew about their sexual relationship. He offered to have sex to calm her down, but she told him he was not a person who calmed her down. She said his distracting her didn't make her feel like the brilliant intern she could be, so she decided no more sex. Later, Amelia invited Andrew to be the new Edwards and she also put Sam on her team when she found out that Sam had written a paper that had impressed Amelia.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nShe had them do viability research on five proposed projects for the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. While left alone in the lab, he became distracted by her tongue as she was eating chips, so he retaliated by playing their song. She told him to stop seducing her and quickly left. The next day, they continued and Sam took off her scrub top because reading about neuroscience made her overheat, a fact he remembered well. Amelia then came in and told them to stop the viability studies and instead look into ways to remove gliomas without cutting, as she was looking to cure [[Kimmie Park]]. They found nothing, but Amelia herself came up with the idea to use ultrasound ablation, something that had never been done before in brains. They submitted it as a proposal for the Contest, but it didn't make it to round . They resorted to drinking at Joe's to deal with the disappointment.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Alex decided to continue the research, but their approach only led to frying tissue. [[Tom Koracick]] joined the project and commented on Sam being hot. Tom wondered why Amelia was in such a rush to get results. Unaware that Amelia was keeping Tom away from Kimmie, Andrew showed Tom the scans and introduced him to Kimmie. They later adjusted to using multiple beams to come at the tumor from different angles, which still wasn't perfect but seemed to be the right direction to further explore.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working in the ER, Andrew slipped on a sliced-off ear and hit his head. Amelia had his head scanned and diagnosed a grade  concussion, meaning he had to rest with limited stimuli in a patient room. He was only concerned that Sam saw him fall. His peace and quiet was disturbed when Carina and Arizona came to discuss their maternal mortality project in his room. After encouragement from Amelia, Sam went to his room. Before she could confess her love, he told her they were young before, but now they weren't. They were there together and she was never just sex to him. They confessed their mutual love and decided to try to make it work. She climbed into bed with him and they snuggled there, which was witnessed by Amelia as she walked by.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nApril fetched Andrew to help her out on trauma certification day. At one point, she made him pretend to be dying. Sam had to work on reviving him and they started arguing. April had been spiraling, so intern Casey sent her on a wild goose chase with fake pages as she was the thing that was endangering his patients the most. In an attempt to keep her calm, Andrew brought up that he heard she cheated on her trauma certification, too. She said she did and then lost a patient mere months later because she didn't know what to do. She then fully lost control of herself. She said you can do everything right and people still die and frantically started to perform CPR on a dummy. Andrew checked if she was okay. Distraught, she called off the exercise and went inside.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the time came to test their perfected ultrasound ablation project on [[Noah Brosniak]], the team was very nervous as they were unsure if it would work as they hoped. To calm Amelia down, Andrew initiated the superhero pose. The procedure took a long time because heat built up inside Noah's skull with nowhere to disperse, so they had to wait regularly to let it all cool down. After finishing, Amelia went to throw up and Andrew checked on her. While waiting for Noah to wake up, Andrew and Sam went to sleep in an on-call room. Upon waking up, they realized they had spent their night together again and she wondered about his place. She looked around and discovered a box of his stuff. She realized he was living there. He said he was in between places and she invited him to come live with her.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew thinks Carina called ICE on Sam.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew comforts Sam as she faces deportation.]]\nHe did move in with her. As they arrived at the hospital together, Carina mocked them for playing house, but he bounced back that he was in a monogamous relationship that had lasted longer than any of hers. Later, Taryn came to get Andrew for Meredith. He was told that ICE was looking for Sam to deport her back to El Salvador despite her not having been there since she was one year old and not knowing anyone there. She was there under DACA, but she was caught running a red light, which was apparently reason enough for her to be deported. Meredith suggested a greencard marriage. Andrew was open to the idea, but Sam remembered it wouldn't get her legal status, so they thought about other options. Andrew thought Carina had called ICE on Sam and went to confront her, but she said she would never do that to him or Sam. Andrew returned to the OR where they making plans for Sam and suggested they run away to Canada, but Meredith said ICE was treating her as if she snuck into the country illegally and that they couldn't let her become what they were trying to make her be.\n\nMeredith came up with the idea to send Sam to Switzerland to work under [[Cristina Yang]] as Sam's level of medical training would transfer and provided her with a fake application dated back a year. Sam accepted. They said goodbye as the cab arrived at the hospital. He wanted to follow her to Switzerland as soon as he could, but she didn't want him to throw his life away just because she had to. She then confessed she had in fact followed him to Seattle. She told him they didn't work even if they did. After a last kiss, she left for the airport. Maggie came out to comfort Andrew, but he ignored her and went back inside.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was one of the doctors who ate weed cookies. Arizona took him and Maggie into a skills lab so they could wait for the weed to wear off. He lied down on the ground and hallucinated Sam lying with him. After he spent the better part of the day smiling at the hallucination, he tried to reach out, but his hand went right through her. He started sobbing. Maggie took pity on him and took him back to her house. He got comfortable on the couch and she covered him up with a blanket.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref> He stayed at the house and called in sick to work. He just played some guitar, sang songs he made up, and neglected to shower. He slept while Maggie cooked for them. Meredith tried to get Arizona to talk some sense into him, but Arizona got Carina to do it. Carina accompanied Meredith to her house and yelled at him about his behavior, which would make their father ashamed.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref> On his first day back, he was acting tough with the interns, so Maggie invited him on her case to cheer him up. He assisted her and Arizona as they performed a spina bifida surgery on an exteriorized uterus.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Nicole Herman]] returned to the hospital with headaches, Andrew assisted Amelia to find the cause. Amelia was afraid she would have to tell Nicole about her own tumor if Nicole's tumor had grown back. Since the scans were clear, Andrew performed a spinal tap, which led them to diagnose a spinal fluid leak. They only needed to place a shunt to fix that.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew got drunk at Jo and Alex's wedding with the interns. While the guests were waiting for the officiant, the wedding planner tried to fill up the time with a toast. She passed the mic to Andrew, who talked about how he viewed Jo and Alex as family since blood had been spilled between them. He talked about how have to celebrate true love before it's ripped from your claws. Meredith noticed he was spiraling and cut in to take him for a walk. She told him she knew what it was like to lose your love, but he was young and handsome, so he would find love again. She reminded him to look forward. He then leaned in and kissed her. She stopped it and said she was not seducing him. He thought he would be fired, but she was just flattered. They then found Alex and Jo trapped in a shed and freed them.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew is among the guests for Jo and Alex's impromptu ferry wedding.]]\nThe ceremony was called off because of all the things that had gone wrong, including the wedding planner having an allergic reaction, so all guests boarded the ferry back to the city. Meredith officiated an impromptu wedding for the couple on the ferry.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew slept off his hangover on Maggie and Jackson's couch. He wanted to call in sick, but Jackson made him walk to work with them. While walking, Andrew remembered he had kissed Meredith and he felt horrified. He noticed a car speeding towards the crosswalk and he pulled Maggie and Jackson out of harm's way. The car did hit [[Nisha]]. Andrew called an ambulance and Jackson thanked him for saving their lives. At the hospital, he went to Meredith and apologized for kissing her. He promised it wouldn't happen again, but unbeknownst to him, she had been having sex dreams about him. In the OR, Vik made a bottle of hair product stuck inside a man's rectum explode by cauterizing a bleeding in the area around it. The bottle shot around the OR and hit Vik, whose sleeve caught on fire. Andrew reacted quickly and extinguished the flames. Vik thanked him for saving his life. Andrew and Richard failed to resuscitate the patient.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> The high of saving three lives in one day got Andrew out the slump he'd been in since Sam's departure and he wanted to get back at saving lives. His renewed lust for life led him to buy a motorcycle from a patient after he had had an accident with it. After testing it out, he offered Richard to take a ride.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew's motorcycle attracts attention from the sisters.]]\nHis motorcycle attracted attention from Maggie, Meredith, and Amelia. Maggie tried to set him up with Amelia in an attempt to get her to leave Owen before Teddy could drop her pregnancy bomb on them, but Amelia wasn't interested. Andrew was surprised she would do that given his history with Maggie, but she said their history was ancient. Meredith then caught his eye, as she had been lingering in his mind since the kiss. That night, Andrew took Link and Richard to Joe's bar.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nCarina informed Andrew she would be returning to Italy because there was something going on with their father. She only told him he was not dying, but didn't elaborate further. They came across Meredith, who was dressed up for a date, and Andrew was stunned by her beauty. Andrew, Maggie, and Bailey treated [[Natalie Forrester]], who was rapidly declining. [[Evan Forrester]] tried to keep her impending death from their son [[Max Forrester|Max]], but he had noticed that she wasn't doing well. Andrew took him to the helipad to distract him. Andrew shared with him the story of his mother's death to illustrate that the truth can be scary, but Max only took away from it that his father was lying to him about his mother's death. Max then ran off. Andrew chased after him. While he was looking for Max around the hospital, he came across Carina and told her she was a good sister.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref> Andrew and Maggie joined Station 's search efforts and he was impressed with their work. When the rescue was over, he gave a firefighter's number to Vic, who had been quite hostile towards him for tagging along against protocol.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Owen was out for the day, Richard took charge in the ER and presented Andrew with the opportunity to watch over the interns there. Richard checked in on them stitching up several lacerations and pointed out that Levi needed some pointers, which Andrew then provided. Richard told him he should have noticed that himself and told him to take initiative. Later, a patient needed to be intubated. Levi went to get Richard, but Andrew had done it himself without accepting any help from Taryn by the time he arrived. Richard reminded him they were a teaching hospital. Andrew thought Richard had a problem with him, but Richard said it was the contrary. He needed doctors who not only give the best care but also teach others to do the same, and he saw potential for that in Andrew. After work, Andrew, Link, and Richard went to Joe's again to play guitar and sing.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was supposed to operate on [[Flor Medina]] with Meredith and Alex, but when he discovered that Flor had a little crush on him and preferred he didn't operate on her, he decided to sit the surgery out. He told Meredith he really wanted to work with her, but she said there would be more chances for that in the future. Andrew checked in on Flor after the surgery and sat with her. She asked about some of his favorite things and if he had a girlfriend. He told her he did not have one.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Link both express interest in Meredith.]]\nAfterwards, he ran into Meredith and complimented her on the flower tucked behind her ear. They exchanged some banter about his post-op \"date\" with Flor and he asked about her date, which had been set up by [[Cece Colvin]]. She told him she had scared the guy off. The elevator then arrived and both Andrew and Link held the doors open for her. Confused by their sudden chivalry, she decided to take the stairs.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was put on Cece's case as she started to deteriorate. A patient who got injured in the windstorm proved a perfect match for her. They went to tell Cece and Andrew told her she was only getting this organ because the storm was preventing UNOS from sending the organ anywhere else. He stressed that she was in a bad condition and the chances were real that she would not make it off the table. Nevertheless, Cece accepted the organs and urged Meredith to squeeze all the joy she could out of the life she had been given. Afterwards, Andrew overheard that Meredith accepted Link's invitation for drinks that night. Andrew then found Meredith in the scan room and apologized for having been so blunt with Cece. She called him brave for doing that. He then told her that she had been on his mind since the kiss and that he wanted her to know he was one of her options. He said he was a senior resident, so it wouldn't be an abuse of power, and added that Maggie didn't mind, either. She could make up all the excuses, but he said there was something undeniable between them. They almost kissed, but Meredith said she didn't trust herself. She promised to think about what he had said and left. They later ended up on an elevator together on their way to the OR for Cece. A power outage had the elevator trapped between floors and left them stuck together.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith bond while stuck in an elevator.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Link both ask Meredith out on a date.]]\nNeither of them had a signal. He likened their situation to being in the TARDIS, where time and space and the rules don't apply, but she said the rules still applied. They sat down and she asked him about moving to Italy, promising it would stay between them. In Italian, he shared the story of why his mother and father split up. He then tried to lift her up to the trap door, but she couldn't reach it. She dropped back into his arms and their lips nearly touched. He asked why them kissing would be so bad. She repeated she was his superior and that she was trying to learn from her past mistakes. In Italian, he told her about how badly he wanted to kiss her. She revealed she had taken Italian in college and had therefor understood every word. As they leaned in and nearly kissed, the elevator started working again. The doors opened and she rushed to the OR. She lost Cece in the OR and ran into Andrew after getting off the elevator. He joked she didn't seem to learn from her mistakes as she still used the elevator. She commented on his cocky behavior and he asked her out on a date. Link then came up to ask her the same question. She felt haunted by Cece's ghost and went home to her children without giving an answer to either of them.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nWhenever they operated together, Andrew would observe Meredith closely and try to seduce her. On another case, Andrew had to step up to perform an emergent subtotal colectomy when Owen was accidentally paralyzed by the anesthesiologist. Alex later checked in and told him he had done a great job. On a high, Andrew sent Meredith a text to come celebrate his flying solo with him, but she was getting to know Link at her son's birthday party and ignored him.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew again tried his luck on Christmas Eve and asked Meredith out for a drink, but she was heading home to put her kids to bed so Santa could come. She did, however, invite him to join her to Jo and Alex's NYE party. After they checked on [[Natasha Deon]] and witnessed Meredith talk to Link, Andrew asked her when she was going to stop stringing Link along and giving him false hope. Meredith wasn't sure it was false hope. Andrew was growing tired of wasting time not being with her. He thought she wasn't brave enough to choose him and asked if the NYE party was a date or if she'd ignore him there. She confirmed it was a date. However, she chose to stay with Natasha and [[Garrett Boland|Garrett]] and stood up both Andrew and Link.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew confronts Meredith with her behavior towards him.]]\nHe was angry with her and she apologized but said she had a patient. He told her she also had a phone and that she was just rude to treat him like a doormat. While doing another surgery on Natasha, Levi came out as gay and said he had found someone who made him happy. Andrew said life's too short not to share it with someone who lights up your world, not so subtly hinting at Meredith that he wanted to be with her. On Valentine's Day, Natasha's condition had become dire, but Meredith urged Garrett not to give up. Andrew later questioned how she could tell Garrett that if she herself kept running away from love. He used to think she was so beyond him, but he had changed his mind about that. He called her a kid hiding behind excuses like her job and her family. Meredith then turned around and asked Link out on a date. Andrew was later present when Meredith officiated a wedding between a dying Natasha and Garrett. Afterwards, Andrew took Meredith up the roof for a spontaneous date with champagne. They made a toast to Garrett and Natasha. She decided not to go on her date with Link and shared her first real kiss with Andrew.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith refused to let Andrew take her on a real date until she had cleared it with Maggie, so he resorted to buying her coffee and staring at her longingly at work. She took him aside and told him to quit the staring as it was distracting her. At the end of the day, Meredith paged Andrew to a lounge. She had been given Maggie's blessing and decided she would take him out as she didn't want to sit on the back of his motorcycle. He agreed to the plan but only if it could be his treat. They shared a kiss and left holding hands.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew assisted Meredith while she was breaking the hospital's longest surgery record. He distracted her when she needed him to by telling a story of the time when, as a kid, he believed that he had broken the record of most rollercoaster rides in one day. After the surgery, Andrew found her sleeping on a gurney in a hallway. He transferred her to a bed in an empty room and left her to sleep.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith kiss before heading into the party.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and Andrew realized they caused the \"fire.\"]]\nOn the day of Catherine's party, Meredith informed Chief Karev of their relationship. They went to the party together, but as they had her house to themselves, they didn't plan on staying long. However, Meredith got sucked into Amelia's drama with Owen, preventing them from leaving soon. As Amelia was planning to come sleep at the house, Meredith and Andrew resorted to making out in the guest room. He got a call from Carina, but he declined it to keep on kissing his girlfriend. They were caught by Richard, who awkwardly left. They went back downstairs to the party and, in an attempt to act normal, took over from the catering staff. They put a tray of egg rolls in the oven. The tray was made out of plastic and caused the entire apartment to fill with smoke. Everyone was evacuated. While out on the street, they decided to go to Andrew's place to avoid any further distractions. However, as they arrived there, so did Carina and Vincenzo, their father. He greeted his son and Andrew introduced Meredith to him.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nThe siblings caught up and Andrew found out that his father had come here to pitch medical research. He seemed stable to him while Carina insisted he was bipolar. He briefly visited Meredith in her lab for a kiss and then joined his family for the research pitch to Alex. Vincenzo was looking for funding for external gestational research, which he had already gotten to the stage of animal trials. After  days, a healthy sheep was born. Alex asked for some time to consider. Andrew and Vincenzo then got coffee. Vincenzo told him he was hoping they could make up for the time they had lost because his controlling mother had come between them. He assured Andrew that the research would put him on the map so that Meredith wouldn't be beyond him anymore.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew asks Meredith to trust his judgment about his father.]]\nLater, Meredith found Andrew and Carina arguing. Andrew had decided to sign on for the research, while Carina insisted their father wasn't well. She stated she knew their father better than Andrew did and that their father knew how to manipulate Andrew into doing his bidding. Meredith had her doubts, knowing full well how clouded one's judgment can get, but Andrew was sure on the matter and asked her to trust him on it. Alex decided to fund the research. Before helping their father set up in the lab, the siblings met outside. Still on the fence about it herself, Carina hoped Andrew was right about this.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew wakes up in the lab.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Carina and her father have a fight.]]\nAndrew spent all his time on the research and even spent nights in the lab to monitor the lambs. Meredith brought him coffee as a peace offering to apologize for her suspicions about his dad. He appreciated that and invited her to spend a night at his place if were to spend it there himself. She accepted and went to work. That morning, a lamb died and an argument erupted between Carina and Vincenzo, who threw the former off the study. Alex had them write a report on the matter so he could review it. Carina pleaded with Andrew to see their father's illness, but Andrew insisted he was fine. Carina thought the project was too important to let it be ruined by their father. Andrew insisted she didn't have the right degree to diagnose him and that she always butted heads with their father like this. While continuing the work, Andrew told his father to control his tantrums because they didn't help their credibility. They discussed Carina backing out and Vincenzo wanted to reach out to make peace, but Andrew told him that she was occupied with a trauma patient who might lose her baby. Vincenzo went behind everyone's backs and pitched his research as a solution to the couple. He was scolded by Alex, but Vincenzo couldn't understand that it was way too soon for human trials.\n\nAndrew then finally saw the truth, but Vincenzo remained unbothered, stating he was the only one willing to do what it took to save that baby. Andrew realized it was just like that night when he insisted on saving those seven people by himself. Andrew told him that letting the baby die now was merciful compared to letting it die in a bag by the hands of a mad scientist who didn't know what he was doing, but Vincenzo did not agree. Alex then gathered the DeLucas in his office and announced he was pulling the funding. Infuriated and unwilling to let someone take over, Vincenzo packed up his stuff and moved his research back to Italy. Meredith visited Andrew as he was cleaning out the lab and he lashed out at her. She stated she would never tell she had been right. He apologized and said he shouldn't be around people. She told him to let her know if he needed anything and left.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew continued to keep his distance from Meredith. Andrew got put on Alex's service for a total pancreatectomy. The surgery was cancelled because the girl's labs showed a high glycemia. Alex told Andrew he was sorry about the cancellation. Suspecting Meredith had pulled strings to cheer him up, Andrew yelled that he didn't need any favors from him. Later, the doctors discovered that the girl had sabotaged her surgery by drinking juice. They found out she didn't want the surgery because then she would have to go back to school, where she was bullied. Andrew pushed the mother too hard to convince her daughter to get the surgery, so Alex threw him off the case. Andrew then went to talk to the girl behind Alex's back and shared how he had survived being bullied himself. Alex then performed the surgery without Andrew to punish him for disobeying him. Later, Andrew yelled at Alex for being unprofessional, but Alex told him that he was the unprofessional. He should have talked to Nora first before going at her mother like he did. Alex understood parents can do a number on their kids, but Andrew let it interfere with his job and his relationship today. Alex also told him not to bite people's hand when they reach out, because then they stop doing so. That night, Meredith visited him at home and told him she was past the time of wondering if her boyfriend was ignoring her. Andrew understood and said it hurt him that he was unable to help his father, so he needed some time to hurt and he didn't want to drag her down with him. Now he was ready to let her back in. He cooked them dinner and they enjoyed each other's company.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nRichard scheduled a solo lap appy for Andrew. Andrew examined the patient, who complimented him on his looks in front of Richard. She then asked Andrew to check out her Instagram. Richard told him it was part of the job so Andrew complied and listened to the patient talk about crossfit. In surgery, Richard asked about the long-term plan. Andrew thought he was talking about his relationship with Meredith and said they hadn't discussed it yet. He said he respected where Meredith came from and that she was amazing to him. Richard then said he meant Andrew's career. Andrew said he was attracted to general surgery. The surgery had to be converted to an open procedure when they came across dead bowel. Richard wanted to take over, but Andrew knew the steps of an ileocecectomy and pulled it off. Once Andrew was done, Richard complimented Andrew and said he'd put in a good word with the head of general surgery. That night, Meredith and Andrew had dinner at his place again and he talked her through his day.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nAs their relationship progressed, they also had sex at Meredith's house, but she wouldn't allow him to sleep over yet. One night, when he was sneaking out, he ran into Zola as she was getting some water from the kitchen. He returned to Meredith to tell her about it. She hated that her plan on how to tell them was now ruined, but he was just glad she had been planning to do so. She then checked if the coast was clear before sending him out again. Later at work, Meredith told him Zola appeared to be fine and she asked if he liked kids. He did, citing his  first cousins whom he all adored. Later, Meredith and Andrew had to deliver a baby of a woman who didn't know she was pregnant. Meredith later watched Andrew hold the baby in the woman's room, which convinced her to tell her kids about him.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile working in the clinic, Andrew encountered [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabriella]] and her father [[Luis Rivera]]. Luis had come to the U.S. on a visa and applied for asylum. He sent for his family once he had an apartment, but they were detained and separated at the border. Gabby had just arrived in Seattle with severe abdominal pain, having received little medical care while in detention. She was diagnosed with an obstruction and required surgery, for which Luis couldn't pay. Andrew took him to fill out forms to apply for state coverage, but it was denied because he made too much money cleaning offices. Meredith, who had joined the case, promised that she had a plan, which turned out to be filling out Ellis's name on the paperwork so they could benefit from her insurance. She knew it was wrong, but insisted that she was trying to remedy something even more wrong. However, in surgery, it was discovered that the obstruction was caused by a lymphoma, meaning the case wouldn't be over with just the one surgery. Andrew stood by as Meredith and Richard decided to make Gabby sicker on paper and keep her hospitalized for  days so that a new state policy would kick in, which was regardless of income. Throughout the day, Andrew had been quiet, so Meredith assumed he disapproved of her actions. However, he was actually in awe of her. He told her he could have been Gabby when he had come here from Italy and he loved that she didn't look away from the situation like so many people do. He had been quiet because he was afraid he'd tell her that he loved her if he opened his mouth. Taken aback, she told him she was glad they had cleared that up and quickly left.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew spent the night in a chair next to Gabby's bed. She woke him up by throwing her stuffed animals at him. Later, when she admitted to being scared of the MRI, he took her there to take a scan of one of her stuffed animals to show her how it worked. Alex walked in as he was doing so and hinted to a career in peds. Later, Andrew met Jo and Meredith outside of the conference room where Bailey and Catherine had been holed up all day. Meredith asked him to look after Jo while she went off to look for Alex. Jo brought up his love confession to Meredith, but he was soon paged to the room by Bailey.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew takes the fall for Meredith.]]\nInside, he was informed that the insurance company had discovered the insurance fraud. Andrew took the fall for Meredith. Before he was arrested, he was allowed to go inform Meredith, who was stuck inside the pressurized hyperbaric chamber, of what he had done. He told her he had lied to her about Gabby having insurance and he apologized for using her daughter's name. He said what he did wasn't fair to her or her kids, who needed her. Meredith realized what he was doing and begged him not to, but his mind was made up and he was taken away by Catherine.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was arrested and escorted out of the hospital. Meredith later visited him in jail and told him his move was stupid, stating he would lose his license. He said he was called into a room and asked for details and he couldn't bring himself to turn her in. She told him that he needed to develop some instincts for self-preservation if they were going to be together. She wanted to clean up her own messes and live in her truth, because what she was trying to remedy was so much more wrong than what she did. Meredith then told him she was going to turn herself in to get it out. She admitted she felt terrified. She stated she loved him, too, and then walked out to go turn herself in.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith came clean and the charges against Andrew were dismissed. He sat in her corner during her meeting, where she confessed to not really regretting her actions, instead blaming the system, which landed her with court-ordered community service to pick up trash on the streets. He then returned to work with a cocky attitude to Bailey, knowing she was in need of help. He was put on the case of [[Jai Prishna]]. He convinced Jai's wife Mari not to give up hope just yet despite Jai living his worst nightmare of being hooked to machines. He promised to tell her when it was time to give up hope, but a week later, Jai recovered without deficits. After a few weeks of community service, Meredith ate ice cream with Andrew and told him that word of her community service got out at Zola's school, but she didn't care because she and her kids were healthy and she had found some sense of accomplishment in the work. As he joked about robbing a store to get some roadside vacation himself, her happiness disappeared when she found out that the medical board was pursuing action against her license.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was dropping Meredith off for her community service when she found out that her medical license hearing was in three months. With the other residents, Andrew partook in Bailey's skills lab on the axillary-bifemoral bypass for [[Wade Foltz]], where he pointed out she was using different grafts than Meredith. He finished first in the skills lab but while Bailey had promised that the first one to finish would get to do the anastomosis, she chose Taryn instead, who had finished mere seconds after him. She did allow him to scrub in with them. When there was a bleeding from Taryn's suture line, Bailey had Andrew step in to fix it. Wade was fine in post-op. Andrew confronted Bailey with her choosing Taryn while he should have been the one to do that part of the surgery. He suggested she had sidelined him because of his relationship with Meredith. She warned him not to question her methods, as Taryn needed to experience the adrenaline and fear that makes you a surgeon, and told him not to make this personal. She suggested he started thinking about his career and let go of certain loyalties. After work at Meredith's, he was told by Meredith that she was going to write an article about the brokenness of the medical system after all the problems she had seen while on community service.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nWhile dropping Meredith off again, she told him she had gotten in touch with a website that was interested in publishing her article on the medical system. She listed some ideas she had, all of which would rub the medical community the wrong way. She didn't care since they were already in a fight anyway. At work, Andrew had to take responsibility and face Bailey's anger when Levi let a catheter guide wire slip into a patient under his supervision. They managed to save the patient in the cath lab. Afterwards, Andrew had Levi tell the patient's family but he had to take over as Levi was being too elaborate with needless details. At home, he told Meredith about it while having Link and Amelia over. The pair came to share the news that she was pregnant. Andrew congratulated them.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nMuch to her surprise, the website had pulled all of Meredith's ideas into one article that trashed Grey Sloan instead of the medical system itself. Andrew noticed the residents were panicking about the effect that would have on their future careers but they tried to shut him out because of his involvement with Meredith. He went to see Bailey and told him there were also some scheduling conflicts, which the Chief Resident couldn't resolve since she quit over the article. Bailey then appointed him Chief Resident and told him to go fix the mess his girlfriend had made. Andrew let Meredith know how mad Bailey was. In the evening, he came across Meredith in the hospital and learned she had tried to explain the situation to Bailey, which didn't go well, and that she got a summons to court since her supervisor had informed the judge that she had walked out on work crew. Andrew hated that she made a choice that could land her in jail and was actively adding to the threat of her losing her license. He wanted her to lay low, do her hours, and return to work to change the system from within. She pointed out nothing she wrote was a lie and refused to sit on her mountain of privilege and let other people fight their own battles. She grew upset and told him that if he really expected her to sit back and let people be hurt and killed by the broken system, he didn't know her at all.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nTom put Andrew on his service to get him to make Meredith make things right with Grey Sloan. He suggested withholding sex but Andrew said that wouldn't work on her. Meredith then appeared with a sick Zola and asked Tom to do a head CT. The CT revealed her shunt needed to be revised. Since she was supposed to appear before the judge that day, Andrew told Meredith he would keep an eye out for Zola so she could go, which angered her. He also offered to sit with Meredith during the surgery but she also hated that he was offering to skip out on surgeries in his residency just to be her human tissue. The surgery went well and Meredith had him to stay with Zola in post-op. In the evening, she ran into him when she went out to look for Jello for her daughter. Andrew had anticipated that request and handed her a cup. Meredith's lawyer then came up and informed them that she would have to make up the hours she skipped out on community service in jail.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, while Meredith was in jail, Andrew came to pick up the kids to drive them to school. He wanted to help Zola out with her costume wings but she rejected his help, telling him he was not her father. While working together with Jackson, Jackson inquired about Meredith. Andrew admitted he didn't really know how she was doing as her eight allowed minutes of phone time mostly went to him telling her about her kids. He explained he was helping out and told him about Zola's reaction. Jackson said that with kids, there's almost always a reason for such behavior. During rounds, Maggie came to drop off Zola with him as she had a surgery and Zola was refusing to go to daycare. Zola read her book while Andrew rounded on his patients but eventually discovered that she has disappeared from her chair. He found her in the gallery and asked her if he did anything wrong that morning. She didn't like it when people touched her wings because her dad fixed them before he died. She admitted she was scared she was going to forget him. Andrew assured her that wouldn't happen as Derek was such a legend that people would keep talking about him, which is how Andrew himself learned a lot about him. He told her the story of how her father had saved [[Isaac (Season )|Isaac]], which made Zola warm up to him again. They went trick-or-treating together. While they were sorting out the candy, Meredith came home from jail. He shortly greeted her while she hugged her kids, whom he took back to sorting the candy while Meredith spoke to her sisters.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew accompanied Meredith, her sisters, and Alex to the hotel for her hearing before the medical commission. Andrew was called to testify and questioned about when he had found out about the fraud. He said he hadn't until Richard did. The panel knew about his and Meredith's relationship through documentation from HR. Andrew assured them that the relationship was consensual and that Meredith hadn't forced him to keep the fraud quiet. He was also questioned about paperwork that detailed his being mistreated by attendings, including Meredith, after being assaulted by Alex. Andrew said that was ancient history and apologized to Meredith for hurting her case but she told him it was okay. During a short recess, Andrew and Meredith sat down and she told him their relationship wouldn't survive if she were to lose her license while he would still get to cut. Andrew followed the hearing, which ended with Meredith getting to keep her license. Andrew briefly hugged her but then disappeared as she turned to her other colleagues. He visited her at home and asked to talk. She apologized to him for what she had said but he knew she had meant it. He told her he stood up for her in court and the hospital and went to jail for her because he loved her. The whole experience made him realize that she didn't see him as her partner. When she talked about Derek in that hearing, he finally understood a feeling he had been having for a while, which was that she loved Derek but respected him, too. Meredith said she respected Andrew as well but he knew some part of her wasn't sure if he would ever be on her level. He told her to take some time to figure out what she wanted and whether he was part of that or not.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nOn her first day back, Andrew was surprised to see her. She told him she had wanted to tell him Bailey had re-hired her but he had been too busy dumping her. He said he didn't dump her but she said it was all the same to her. Together with all the other residents, they started rounds, during which they met [[Cormac Hayes]], the new Head of Pediatric Surgery. While scrubbing in, Andrew told Link and Nico about his inadvertent dumping of Meredith. They pointed out he wasn't her equal and might never be but, given their own relationships, they knew that that didn't mean she didn't respect him. They advised him to go find Meredith and undo what he did. He eventually found her but after watching her for a bit, he just walked off without talking to her.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nDespite multiple traumas coming in due to the car crash at Joe's bar, Tom tasked Andrew with babysitting [[Elliott Calhoun]] in the ICU. While doing that, Andrew texted Meredith asking if they could talk later. Elliott's heart then started beating again. Andrew went to find Teddy, who told him to prep Elliott and then she'd join him to take Elliott off ECMO. That went well and Elliott's wife thanked Andrew for saving her husband, though Andrew acknowledged it wasn't actually his doing. Andrew then visited Maggie at home to let her know that Elliott had made it through. She was relieved to hear that. Andrew then asked her for advice on how to deal with issues with Meredith as he meant some of the things of he had said but he realized that asking her to take time was wrong. Maggie only said he had hurt a woman who had been hurt more than enough for a lifetime. Andrew then stood there as she was served with a lawsuit over Sabi's death.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith came to find Andrew at work and told him she missed him. He reminded her he hadn't broken up with her so she didn't have to miss him. He then told her that [[Suzanne Britland]], his post-op appy patient was inexplicably running fevers. She told him she'd think about it but advised him to take it up to Bailey. They did scans that confirmed Andrew didn't make a mistake during his surgery but didn't give them any pointers as to why Suzanne had also suddenly developed a cardiac tamponade. As they were clueless, Bailey instructed Andrew to create a war room and gather all the people who could help them. Meredith found him there and had him talk her through the entire case.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThey reconciled while working together closely and Andrew spent the night at her place. Whilst making out with her in the morning, Andrew was paged because Suzanne had been transferred to the CCU. He told her he had used her name to lure [[Lauren Riley]], a diagnostics genius from San Francisco, to help them on the case. Andrew wanted to talk about the status of their relationship but Meredith wanted him to get to Suzanne first. Andrew pressured the residents to work on the case and visited Suzanne, who had found Meredith's hospital from hell article. After Andrew explained the situation, Lauren Riley arrived and explained her method of starting over from the beginning. Outside, Lauren asked Andrew to get Meredith. He claimed she was in surgery but Maggie pointed out she was standing nearby. Meredith's puzzled reaction made Lauren realize that she had been lied to. Andrew begged her to stay, which worked. He watched closely as Maggie, on her first day back, operated on Suzanne. After the surgery, Lauren recommended withdrawing all medication to see if certain symptoms had been masked. She and Andrew presented their idea to Suzanne whilst underlining that Lauren was the best at what she does, with Lauren sharing a story of her own three sisters to ease Hadley and Suzanne's concerns about the hospital. Suzanne then consented. Outside the room, Lauren confessed to Andrew that she was an only child and had lied with ease to get Suzanne to consent.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nAs Suzanne's condition worsened over the next three days, Andrew began to question the approach but Lauren insisted. Determined to end Suzanne's suffering, Andrew rudely interrupted a conversation between Meredith and Cormac to ask her about a certain patient from the past with some similar symptoms to Suzanne's. Cormac pointed out his rudeness and left. Both Carina and Meredith noticed how fast Andrew was talking as he explained his query. Concerned, they asked when he had slept last, which he refused to answer to. Lauren then came to inform him the pericardial biopsy came back negative for carcinomatosis. Meredith questioned their progress but Lauren said every diagnosis ruled out was progress. Meredith then pointed out that Andrew was fried and appeared obsessed. Lauren said he knew the case inside out and she was relying on his being obsessed. Suzanne began bleeding from her mouth and Andrew saw that all her blood cell counts had gone down. While performing a bone marrow biopsy, Lauren asked Andrew if he was still sleeping with Meredith. She had observed the way they argued, which made her figure it out. He confessed that he wasn't sure but Lauren said it explained her concern over his wellbeing. Soon after, Bailey called Andrew into her office to inform him that Meredith was taking over Suzanne's case, with the first step being putting her back on her meds. Andrew began objecting, stating he hadn't made any mistakes, but Bailey cut him off before he could say something he would regret later. Just as Lauren was packing up her stuff, with all of her progress being undone, the results of the biopsy came back, which made Lauren diagnose Still's disease. They rushed to her room and injected steroids into Suzanne's IV without informing Meredith of what they were doing. Meredith asked Andrew for a word outside but he ignored her and left.\n\nIt turned out they were right and Suzanne soon felt better. Meredith told Andrew to go into her room so they could thank him, but he snapped that she could go in and take the credit for her patient. He said he saved Suzanne's life no thanks to her. Meredith pointed out his career would have been over if he had been wrong after what he pulled. He asked if she would have given permission. She admitted she would have asked some questions because she didn't think he was in the right state of mind to make life-or-death decision. Andrew insisted it was the right decision. As she said he wasn't acting like himself, he yelled that she was a hypocrite as she never followed rules herself. Having overheard his outburst, Cormac stepped in to stand up for Meredith. Andrew went on to say how he had saved Suzanne's life against all odds. Meredith pointed out he was sounding like his father and told him to get some sleep. Andrew then said he didn't need any of this nor Meredith, so they were done. He walked off to go watch Suzanne being reunited with her kids.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAs a blizzard raged over Seattle, Andrew overheard that one of Cormac's patients couldn't get their liver transplant because the liver couldn't be transferred from Seattle Pres to Grey Sloan. Andrew said he would personally get the liver. Meredith tried to talk him out of it, pointing out people were freezing to death, but he brushed it off, saying he was used to the cold. He expected her to bring up his father again and left, going out into the cold to retrieve the liver. He eventually returned with the liver, which he delivered straight to the OR, with frostbitten fingers. Against his wishes, Andrew was brought to a treatment room where Jackson started working on his hands while Andrew and Carina argued over his careless behavior. Andrew wanted to go treat patients but Jackson pointed out he would lose his hands and career if he didn't stay for treatment. Jackson did his best and said the next twelve hours were critical. Carina and Meredith came to his room. Meredith said the child made it. He aggressively said she would be dead if Meredith had had things her way. Carina said they were worried about him. Carina said this was just like when their father started showing symptoms, at the same age as Andrew was now. Andrew's response was throwing Meredith out of his room.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nAt odds with Meredith yet again, Andrew had to sit through mandatory therapy with [[Cynthia Cole]], who had to sign off on him before he could operate again. During the session, he insisted he didn't need to be there and denied having experienced any symptoms of mania. He claimed he had just had a stressful couple of weeks but that his behavior had only saved patients' lives. After the session, he went to the ER and fixed the overflow. With Richard having given up his service, he thought that he could help out, but Bailey still forbade him from treating patients. After work, Andrew ran into Jo at the bar and offered her a drink. He suggested that since they were both single now, they could have sex. She threw her drink in his face and told him to get help.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew examined a teenage patient who came into the clinic under the name [[Erin Banks|Cindy Wright]] with her aunt [[Opal]]. He began to suspect that the \"aunt\" was really a human trafficker due to her always answering questions for the girl and never leaving her side. He brought his concerns to Dr. Bailey who doubted him due to his deteriorating mental health but she still visited the patient herself. She didn't find any cause for concern and took Andrew off the case, telling him to meet her in her office the next morning. However, Andrew was not convinced and took \"Cindy\" up to the surgical floor, where family members are not allowed.\n\nEventually, Andrew and the unsuspecting patient made their way to the waiting room, where a crowd formed as he stood between Opal and Cindy to keep them apart. He frantically asked for security to detain Opal but Dr. Bailey stopped them and Carina begged for him to stop his behavior. He called for everyone to follow protocol and make a human chain around Opal, but instead they exchanged sad looks and formed the chain around him. Opal and Cindy rushed together and comforted each other as Andrew stood on a chair and yelled that Opal was selling people and their affection was a trauma bond, not love. Dr. Bailey tells Andrew to go with security or he will be banned from the hospital, causing him to break down as he realized that no one supported his belief. He went with them and quit his job instead of accepting the suspension that Bailey gave him. Meredith followed him into a stairwell after seeing Dr. Bailey chase after him. He told Meredith that the more he tries to accomplish the impossible and change people's lives, the more he's judged and called crazy. She comforted him and begged for him to take the suspension instead of quitting. They made an agreement that he would as long as Dr. Bailey would call the national trafficking hotline to have them investigate Opal.\n\nShortly afterward, Opal forcefully escorted Cindy out of the emergency room undetected. She thought Cindy said something to Andrew, but Cindy insisted she didn't. Unaware of the pair being gone, Dr. Bailey called the hotline and they told her not to scare Opal off. However, since she had already left, all Dr. Bailey and Meredith could do was hope that Andrew wasn't right.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nDespite being placed on leave, Andrew returned unofficially to help diagnose Richard after his public meltdown at a conference. Andrew barely slept during the weeks he researched possible causes with Meredith. He prevented Catherine from her attempt to take Richard home and rushed into the OR when Dr. Bailey was preparing to conduct Richard's nerve biopsy. She tried to kick him out of the room but he knocked over her instrument tray and convinced her to test Richard's blood for cobalt poisoning because of a past hip replacement that could be deteriorating. Andrew's diagnosis was correct and he was allowed to scrub in (but not touch Richard) after Meredith reminded Dr. Bailey that the major save was because of him.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Andrew entered a severe depressive state. Despite this, he managed to visit Cindy when she came back to the hospital in a worse condition, this time without Opal. He was right about her being a victim of human trafficking and he was the only one she would trust. Andrew comforted her and stayed with her, eventually learning that her real name is Erin Banks. The doctors called the police and informed them. Andrew's depressive episode continued and Richard, Meredith, Bailey, and Carina staged an intervention with the support of his psychiatrist. After being defensive for a moment, he broke down and said his one goal in life was to not end up like his father. He admitted he was not okay but did not know what to do and the group got him to agree to going on medication to help manage his condition.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> He worked on his mental health after the intervention and his relationships with the group improved, eventually getting involved with Meredith's COVID- treatment and supporting Dr. Bailey after her mother's death.\n\nOpal returned to the hospital during the pandemic to check on an accomplice of hers who had been arrested and brought to the hospital after a botched trafficking scheme. Unaware of who she was, Levi noticed her and examined her when she claimed she had been mugged. He brought a police officer to take her statement on the mugging so she made up a story. She left shortly afterward due to the risk of being at Grey-Sloan. Andrew spotted her in the parking lot and enlisted the help of Carina in following Opal so he would not lose her again.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nWhile trailing Opal through Seattle,  Andrew was stabbed by an unknown assailant. Opal and the attacker were arrested as Andrew was rushed to Grey-Sloan, where he was treated in surgery by Hunt, Altman, and [[Reza Khan|Khan]]. During this time, Andrew was on the beach with Meredith in her dream sequence, where they were able to share some moments together. He told her that he didn't regret following Opal because we go through life ignoring atrocities all the time, but it makes sense to fight for people. Back in the real world, he woke up and Carina told him that the traffickers were arrested so he saved a lot of kids but she was still mad at him. Though the initial surgery was a success, Andrew later suffered a cardiac tamponade and went into DIC, resulting in the need for him to return to surgery. Meanwhile, Meredith and Andrew saw a woman calling to Andrew on the beach: his deceased mother. Andrew said he needed to go and Meredith told him that she would miss him. He ran off to reunite with his mother. At the same time, Khan told Altman, Hunt, and the rest of the surgical team that Andrew\us heart would not restart as he had already been down for forty minutes. They reluctantly stopped and Andrew flatlined. Khan asked if anyone was going to call time of death but was met only with silence and heartbroken looks. He called time of death as :, and Andrew and his mother walked away on the beach, arm in arm.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew was very confident and easygoing. He had a strong emotional and soft side, especially when it came to romantic relationships. Sometimes he could make very irrational decisions.\n\n\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nAfter not being able to save one of the twins, Andrew ended up at the bar getting drunk with Maggie. She kissed him, and they ended up sleeping together.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref> The next day, she avoided him and then told him that it wouldn't be happening again. Despite this, they began kissing and had sex again.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie and Andrew at Joe's bar]]After they had sex, Maggie had the repeated, urgent need to urinate, so she came back to the hospital. Because OB was understaffed, Andrew came in to examine her. She believed he may have given her an STI. After her exam, she and Andrew talked about how he didn't automatically assume that she gave him something, so she shouldn't automatically assume he gave her something and he said that she could get the test results later, but if she wanted to know anything about his history, she could ask or she could just trust him.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew touched her affectionately while working on a case, Maggie told him he couldn't do that anymore. They needed to keep it professional at work. She admitted to having feelings for him and asked if he could keep it professional at work. He said he could.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen an ambulance exploded in the ER, Maggie repeatedly paged Andrew. He found her and told her she needed to stop paging him so much, but she admitted she was worried about him, believing he'd been in the blast.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after they went public, Andrew became uncomfortable with the way things changed when people knew he was seeing an attending and he started to avoid her. When she confronted him, he ended things with her.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Sam Bello]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Sam and Andrew at a hospital party]]While the details of Andrew and Sam's relationship are unknown, it is known that they had a very complicated, on-and-off relationship for years. The first time they broke up, he stayed on his sister Carina's couch for weeks. He seemed to dislike having Sam in Seattle and tried his best to ignore and avoid her. After she assured him that she didn't come to Seattle for him, they ended up having sex in an on-call room, despite knowing their relationship wasn't good for either of them.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref> [[Jo Wilson]] and [[Alex Karev]] discuss that Andrew and Sam continued to do this every day.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> \n\nThey eventually moved in together as their relationship grew more serious. However, when Sam was discovered by ICE and was in risk of deportation, she decided to continue her medical career in Switzerland under [[Cristina Yang]] and left the country.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref> After Andrew and Sam broke up, Andrew went to Meredith Grey's house and stayed on the couch, not able to get over Sam. At Jo and Alex's wedding, he got drunk out of misery, leading him to kiss Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew drunkenly kissed Meredith, and she rejected his advances, though she said she was flattered. The next day, Andrew remembered what he did and apologized to Meredith, who, unbeknownst to Andrew, was having sex dreams about him. Andrew soon realized he had feelings for Meredith and tried to keep them in tact while she began dating other people with the help of her matchmaker patient. However, during the superstorm, when Andrew saw that Meredith might start dating [[Atticus Lincoln]], he confessed his feelings for her. Meredith told him she had to think about it, but that same day, they got trapped in the elevator, where they learn more about each other, such as that they both speak Italian. They almost kissed until the elevator began working again.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith and Andrew at Catherine's party]]Now that Meredith was fully aware of Andrew's feelings for her, Andrew began to pursue Meredith in competition with her other suitor, Link. Though Meredith initially tried to resist her interest in Andrew by setting up a date with Link, she eventually chose Andrew to be with, and they shared their first kiss on the hospital roof on Valentine's Day. After getting Maggie's approval, Meredith allowed Andrew to take her out on a date, starting their relationship officially.\n\nWhen operating with Richard on a woman's appendectomy, Andrew told him that, while he and Meredith hadn't had any serious conversations about their future yet, she makes him so happy, earning him Richard's approval on the relationship. After Zola caught Andrew trying to sneak out of Meredith's room in the middle of the night, Meredith asked Andrew if he even liked kids, to which he responded that he has sixteen cousins and that her kids might like him more than her. That night, Meredith told her kids about her relationship with Andrew, which they warmly welcomed.\n\nAfter watching Meredith commit insurance fraud for Gabby Rivera's case, Andrew didn't say anything, but looked like he disapproved as they operated on Gabby. Later that day, Meredith told him that she could not apologize for her actions, as she did them to save a family. Andrew told Meredith that she had it all wrong; he was silent because he was in awe of what she did and that he was worried he would accidentally blurt out that he loves her. Though Meredith didn't say it back at first, she eventually told him she loves him too after he took the fall for the insurance fraud and landed himself in jail.\n\nAfter Meredith's trial, he told her that he saw the way she talked about Derek, and said that she didn't just love Derek, she respected him. Meredith said he couldn't compare the two, but Andrew told her to take some time.\n\nWhen Andrew drove himself sleepless from a patient, Suzanne, Carina voiced her concerns to Meredith that he might have the same mania as their father. Meredith took over Suzanne's case and didn't agree with Andrew's course of treatment. However, his treatment led to the discovery of Suzanne having Still's disease. Andrew was angry with Meredith, since if they had followed her idea, they'd never have diagnosed Suzanne. During their fight, Meredith told him he was acting like his father. This only angered Andrew further, and he ended up breaking up with Meredith completely.\n\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nAt a young age, he and his mother moved to the United States while his sister, Carina, stayed behind in Italy with their father. Carina came to Seattle to do research about the female orgasm and discovered Amelia's brain tumor. While in Seattle, Carina also served as OB/GYN when needed.\n\n[[Vincenzo DeLuca]]\nAndrew and his father have a complicated relationship. Vincenzo took him and his sister out on fishing trips, took him on trips on the back of his motorcycle, and taught him how to play soccer and the names of the stars. However, Vincenzo also killed four people while operating in a manic state and never took responsibility for it as he got away with it because of his connections.\n\nAfter Catherine's party, just as Andrew was about to show Meredith his apartment, Carina returned to America with Vincenzo, who was here to propose research for an external womb to the hospital. While Carina didn't trust their father's mental state, Andrew signed on to work on the project after Vincenzo told him this would put him on the map. However, Vincenzo's manic symptoms started to show when the project started failing, leading him to offer the incomplete research to a hospital patient. Andrew had an emotional confrontation with Vincenzo, the project was shut down, and Vincenzo returned to Italy.\n\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nOne evening, Jo was drunk and Andrew took her home. Jo confessed that she couldn't marry Alex because she was already married. When Alex came home, he saw Andrew on top of Jo and thought Andrew was attempting to assault her. Andrew tried to defend himself, but Alex repeatedly punched Andrew. Shortly afterward, Alex was arrested for the assault while Andrew was treated at the hospital. In the aftermath of Alex's arrest, Andrew and Jo bonded because they weren't allowed to speak to others about the trial. When Jo learned that she had to testify, she worried that she would have to talk about her husband. Not wanting to put her through that trouble, Andrew told the DA he'd refuse to cooperate, forcing them to drop the charges against Alex.\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nHe got off to a bad start with Alex, who mistakenly believed Andrew hated kids because he didn't want to work in peds.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref> He was later attacked by Alex at Alex and Jo's apartment because Alex saw him on top of Jo when she was drunk.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> While Alex awaited trial for assault, the two avoided each other. The night before Alex's trial, he decided to take a plea deal to get two years, but before he could do so, Andrew came in and told the DA he wanted to drop the charges. When the DA said it wasn't his case to drop, Andrew said he'd say that it was all a misunderstanding that got out of hand, tanking the DA's case.<ref>[[Jukebox Hero]], x</ref> Alex later apologized to Andrew for what happened, which is what Andrew wanted in the first place.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref> When they had to work together, Alex asked if they were cool and Andrew assured him that they were.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew was an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\nHe was chosen as the new [[Resident#Chief Resident|Chief Resident]] after there was a walkout of doctors in support of [[Meredith Grey]]. He decided to go to medical school after working as an EMT after high school. After a year as a surgical intern, he passed his intern exam and became a [[Resident|resident]]. Subsequently, he has been described by his superiors as one of the star residents of the hospital.\n\n\n*He played the guitar.\n*He said he had a lot of trouble getting to the second date because his first dates usually ended in sex and then women seemed to assume he had moved on.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n*Andrew didn't know baseball.\n*Andrew was Italian and spoke Italian, like [[Giacomo Gianniotti]] himself.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n*Andrew's given name is Andrea.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n*During his hospitalization for his assault, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] said his mother knew her and that she was probably at work. This is contradicted by later events that tell us his mother [[Lucia DeLuca]] has been dead since he was young. [[Krista Vernoff]] said it could be amended to be his stepmother.  \n*His favorite type of food was barbecue.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n*His favorite color was blue.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n*The Beatles were his favorite band.

They were leaves on trees. And I didn\ut even know I was missing the leaves. I didn't even know that leaves existed, and then...leaves! You are glasses.|'''Erica Hahn''' to '''[[Callie Torres]]'''}}\n\n'''Erica Hahn''' is a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] who briefly worked at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and dated another employee, [[Callie Torres]]. She previously worked at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] and attended [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]] where she started a fierce rivalry with [[Preston Burke]].\n\n\n\nWhen Erica was a child, she had continuous headaches, she went to the doctors and was told she needed glasses. It made no sense to her but on the car journey home, she shrieked because the little green blobs she had been seeing all her life were actually leaves, and she didn't even know she was missing them.\n\n\nWhen [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]] needed a heart transplant, Burke and Alex came to Seattle Presbyterian, where there were two donors, but their donor flatlined and went to Erica's donor, trying to get the heart for Denny. When Burke called Izzie to see if Denny is on top of the transplant list, Izzie lied and said he was getting worse, but needed the labs to prove it and cut Denny's LVAD wire.<ref>[[ Seconds]], x</ref> When Burke was shot, Erica was brought in to perform the heart transplant procedure.<ref>[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Harold O'Malley]] had a leaking aortic valve, and George originally wanted Burke to perform the procedure since he thought Burke was the best.<ref>[[Staring at the Sun]], x</ref> However, after becoming suspicious about Burke's hand, he wanted Erica to do the procedure. Despite this, his parents chose to have Burke do the procedure.<ref>[[From a Whisper to a Scream]], x</ref>\n\n\nErica returned to Seattle Grace once again to perform a heart transplant on a father with his brain dead daughter's heart, as Burke wasn't around to do it anymore. After performing the heart transplant, she accused Cristina of having slept her way to the top. Cristina in return called Hahn unprofessional and inappropriate. Erica smirked and then revealed she had just agreed to become the new Head of Cardiothorcic Surgery at Seattle Grace Hospital.<ref>[[Haunt You Every Day]], x</ref>\n\nOn her first day, Erica acquired the nickname \ucThe New Burke\" and met the handsome duo Derek and Mark, who had a gentlemen's evening planned with the Chief. When her patient, who turned out to be allergic to general anesthetia, required a risky open heart surgery, Richard called her in to talk through the surgery that Cristina had suggested to work around the patient's allergy. Hahn figured out the other male attendings didn't have to do this prior to a risky surgery and she called out Richard for being sexist, including the fact that female attendings weren't invited to his gentlemen's evening. She left to go prep for the surgery and denied Cristina the chance to scrub in, choosing Izzie over her. The surgery went well, and Erica then joined the three male attendings at the gentlemen's evening, to which Richard had invited her.<ref>[[Kung Fu Fighting]], x</ref>\n\nAfter some time at the hospital, Hahn changed the schedule in order not to have Cristina on her service and took Meredith off Mark's service. She took the case of the woman whom Cristina saved in the ER and then threw Cristina off the case so Meredith could operate with her. She took Mark's OR to do the surgery. Unbeknownst to Erica, her confident behavior and her surgical skill and finesse sparked Mark's interest.<ref>[[Physical Attraction... Chemical Reaction]], x</ref>\n\nCristina continued to try to impress Erica, but she only grew more annoyed with Cristina's desperate attempts and took a liking to Izzie. Out of necessity, she did page Cristina once to get scans. Throughout the day, she noticed all the attention Mark got because of his looks, but Erica herself remained uninterested.<ref>[[Forever Young]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of the ambulance crash, Hahn had a busy day dividing her time between her patient and a wounded paramedic. She happily let Cristina off her service per Bailey's request and replaced her with Izzie. Erica scrubbed in with Mark, who continued to flirt with her and asked her to meet for drinks, but she preferred to focus on the patient and ignored his moves on her.<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref>\n\nDue to being busy, Hahn failed to check the grafts of one of her patients, which resulted in a complication. Erica really beat herself up over it and Mark remarked she was as unkind to herself as she was to others. While trying to fix the complication, Erica kept on reminding herself that her patient had four children and she did everything she could, managing to save the patient. At the end of the day, she sat down with Callie and Mark and asked to get that drink together after all. Callie realized she needed a friend and joined them. Erica didn't even mind if Mark would be flirting with her, and they took off for Joe's.<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref>\n\n\nThat night out sparked a friendship between Erica and Callie. They really had fun and Erica outdrank Callie and beat her at darts, which made them agree to be on a first-name basis. They bonded over generally not being a people person, but Erica resented Mark, calling him a crass ape of a man when he tried to flirt with her again. However, at the end of the day, she ran into Mark and revealed to him that he was too pretty. They probably would be together if they weren't colleagues, but Erica was convinced she needed to let who she is outside of the hospital. She and Callie then left together to go drink at Joe's.<ref>[[Lay Your Hands on Me]], x</ref>\n\nThey went out together multiple times after that and hung out together frequently, building a true friendship. One time it got so late that they came into the hospital the next morning straight from the bar. Erica was operating on one patient and had Cristina deliver her hourly updates on another, all the while Cristina was trying to win a surgical contest. Hahn offered her to observe as she put in a new valve and Cristina abandoned the contest in favor of her education. That evening, Cristina came home to Callie and Erica drinking at their apartment. Cristina mentioned she was honored to have Hahn visit, but Hahn made it clear she was disturbing the conversation, making Cristina hide herself in her bedroom.<ref>[[Where the Wild Things Are]], x</ref> Their love was sparked in an elevator when Hahn kissed Callie after trying to prove Mark would be intimidated by their relationship in bed.\n\n\nErica and Callie got into a fight about what to do with Izzie Stevens after Erica found out Izzie stole the heart for Denny from one of Erica's patients. She wanted to report Izzie, but Callie was against it. Erica left the hospital parking lot and quit her job abruptly.<ref>[[Rise Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nErica Hahn presents herself as a confident woman, generally focused on her work and not afraid to speak her mind when she sees it right.\n\nDespite her tough approach with her colleagues, Hahn generally has a very good bedside manner and looks out for her patients' welfare to a great extent.\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Erica and Callie kiss.]]\nWhen Dr. Hahn took up a permanent position at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], one of the first things she said to Cristina was \"I date men\" (believing that Cristina got ahead by sleeping with her superiors). [[Mark Sloan]] continually flirted with her but although they were friends, she insisted that he only wanted her because he couldn't have her, though admitting that they might have had a chance if they didn't work together.\n\nAfter making a friend of Callie Torres and getting more involved personally, onlookers became suspicious of a bit more to their relationship. Addison Montgomery plants the seed in Callie's head that the two might be lovers, but when confronted, they both laugh it off, though the idea lingers. Following Mark Sloan's persistent, (if only half-joking) suggestions of starting a threesome, Erica asks Mark whether the idea of her and Callie in a relationship would be intimidating to him, and kisses her in the elevator to prove it. A conflicted Callie can't get Erica out of her head, and the two finally confront their feelings and uneasiness about the \"new territory\", and begin to date. Though both share feelings for each other, Callie and Erica react to the blossoming relationship in different ways. While Callie is unsure what the relationship means for her and her sexuality (still enjoying her sex life with men), after a few nights spent with Callie, Erica realizes that she must be gay, though she admits to relationships with men in the past. For Callie, Erica's revelation makes her nervous and sends her running to Sloan for sex, twice in one day, where she finds the chemistry just as good. Though Callie's bisexuality is not necessarily a failure to commit, Erica is hurt by what she sees as a \"grey area\" in the relationship where she would rather have straight answers. She claims \"you can't be kind of a lesbian\" and walks away from Callie and Seattle Grace, having lost her only personal ally.\n\n\nEarly in her time at Seattle Grace, when word was being passed of a \"Gentleman's evening\" planned by the Chief of Surgery to which only the male attendings were invited, Dr. Hahn grilled Dr. Webber on the lack of professionalism of such an event, likening it to the not-so-distant era of racial discrimination. Later in the evening, she crashed their party and beat them at monopoly. Though generally slow to make friends, Erica befriended [[Callie Torres|Callie]], seeing in her a strong woman and also another loner. At roughly the same time, she became friends with [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] when Addison came to visit (although she still had a slight dislike for Mark).\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nShe had a rough relationship with [[Cristina Yang]], consistently denying her the privilege of sucking up, and making her fight her way to stay on the cardio program. Her first day at Seattle Grace, Erica made it clear that personal and professional life would be separate things, telling Cristina \"if you had the chops in the operating room, you wouldn't need to impress in the bedroom\", referencing Cristina's tendency to have relationships with her former teachers. This harsh attitude didn't go unnoticed. Miranda Bailey, noting Hahn's attitude towards Cristina,\uaadvised her to focus on a new surgical specialty (an act of 'reverse psychology' in that by suggesting that she\uachoose something else, Cristina would be more determined to\uastick with cardio and resist Hahn's hostility).\ua\uaDuring her brief visit, Addison witnessed some of Hahn's hostility and asked why she was so closed to Cristina. Hahn then admitted to her that Cristina reminded her of herself when she was younger. [[Richard Webber]] noticed this tendency of Hahn to shut Cristina out, particularly after Cristina was able to perform a life-saving procedure without assistance despite Hahn having taught her virtually nothing. After the surgery Richard confronted Erica, saying that Cristina's work in the OR should have given her reason to celebrate as it showed she was doing her job effectively. However as this clearly was not the case in this instance, he backed Cristina up and insisted that if she wished to remain in the hospital\uashe would have to improve her teaching methods and not destroy the spirits of her residents. As a\uaresult, Erica made an effort to reevaluate her professional technique. Outside the hospital Hahn was equally hostile to Cristina; while Hahn and Meredith helped Callie and Cristina move into their new apartment, Hahn remained as unpleasant toward Cristina as ever.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nAlthough originally taking a liking to her, Erica disliked [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] strongly after discovering that Izzie had been the root of the cause behind one of her patient's losing out on an important heart transplant, due to Izzie's relationship with Denny Duquette. Though generally emotionally detached, Dr. Hahn is indignant at the unfair treatment to her patient, a good man with kids whose chance was taken away. She was not able to recover from the seemingly personal nature of this attack, to which neither the Chief, the hospital, nor Callie would see her side or come to her defense, one of many causes of her eventual break with the hospital.\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nAlongside Yang, she also maintained a tough edge with\ua[[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]], refusing to operate on [[William George Bailey Jones|Bailey's son]] while she was in the room and calling her a \"blithering idiot\" while in the company of her interns.<ref>[[Forever Young]], x</ref> Bailey was put in charge of producing a team of surgeons to remove an abdominal\ualeiomyosarcoma from a -year-old girl, which has been declared inoperable. The family agreed\uato the surgery only if Hahn was part of the team.\uaFrom the onset, she was overwhelmingly negative, knocking back all suggestions and having no faith that the patient could possibly survive. The surgery was successful and Miranda told Hahn that she deserved no credit for the outcome due to her attitude.\n\nOther residents\nIn comparison to Cristina and Izzie, who both expressed interest in pursuing cardiothoracic surgery as their speciality, Hahn's relationship with the other resident was less clear. However, she did request Meredith to be on her service on the basis of her mother's reputation and on one occasion to replace Cristina. She seemed to\uabe on relatively stable terms\uawith George and Alex even giving the latter a compliment during a complicated surgery on a baby who was born with his heart outside his chest.<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nWhile they respected each other as professionals, Erica and Richard clashed on occasion during her tenure at Seattle Grace. On her first day as head of cardio, Richard called her out on the fact that she had agreed to perform awake heart surgery on a patient who was allergic to anesthesia without consulting him first. Erica was taken aback by this and asked if Burke had been required to do the same. Her hostility was further informed by the fact that Richard had organized a 'gentleman's evening' with Derek and Mark, which Erica considered sexist and comparable to racial discrimination. In the end, the surgery went ahead and Erica attended the evening. In addition to Izzie Stevens, Richard Webber was a catalyst in her abrupt departure from Seattle Grace. Having learned that Izzie was not reported for the Denny Duquette incident, Erica expressed her outrage to Richard, who retaliated angrily, saying that the event did not go unreported. It was reported to ''him'' and he \"dealt with it\" and that Izzie was punished and the matter was closed. Furious, Erica stormed out of the office and left the hospital shortly after realizing that nobody would back her up in any action she planned to take.\n\n\nDr. Hahn is a long-time rival of [[Preston Burke|Dr. Preston Burke]] in the field of cardiothoracic surgery, dating back to their days at [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]], where she graduated second after Burke. She was a cardiothoracic attending surgeon at Seattle Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nAccording to Cristina, Hahn is known amongst her peers for her septal sparing technique, which is employed when performing Ross procedures (known also by the technical term pulmonary autograph).\n\nDr. Stewart from [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] said Erica was the best cardiovascular surgeon he's ever had.\n\nShe and Burke fought over a donor heart, which Burke ultimately won because of faulty information from Izzie pertaining to Denny's condition, and she was contacted for a consult on Harold O'Malley's valve replacement.\n\nShe was considered for the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], but she lost to [[Preston Burke]].<ref>[[The Becoming]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:Ericaleaves.jpg|thumb|right|px|Erica leaves [[Seattle Grace Hospital|SGH]].]]\n\nHahn joined the staff of Seattle Grace Hospital after performing a heart transplant at the request of Chief Richard Webber. As such, she became [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Seattle Grace and appropriately dubbed \"The New Burke\". She left the hospital following the revelation that Izzie was not ever truly punished for what happened with [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]].\n\n\n*She did sunrise yoga with [[Callie Torres|Callie]].<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n*She claims to have never lost a dart game.\n*She needed to wear glasses as a kid.\n**The fact that she does not wear them as an adult may mean that she wears contact lenses, or, like [[Stephanie Edwards]], had laser eye surgery.\n\n*Unlike other the cardiothoracic surgeons in the show, Hahn's departure in [[Rise Up]] was revealed in the [[These Ties That Bind|episode after]].\n*She has the least amount of appearances of any main character, with only  episodes and is also the only main character to not be part of the main cast during an entire season because she was promoted during season four and left during season five.\n**She is also one of the few main characters to appear in every episode during her tenure as a main character.\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nEricaHahn.png\nEricaHahn.png\nEricaHahn.png\nEricaHahn.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Erica-centric or otherwise very informative about her life.\n*[[Kung Fu Fighting]]\n*[[The Becoming]]\n*[[Rise Up]]\n\n\n:'''Erica:''' This is like needing glasses.\n:'''[[Callie Torres|Callie]]:''' I\uve blinded you?\n:'''Erica:''' When I was a kid, I would get these headaches, and I went to the doctor, and they said that I needed glasses.

Before medical school, they even went traveling in [[Europe]] together. They had a huge fight in Amsterdam that changed their friendship forever.\n\n\nSadie came to Seattle to be an intern at Seattle Grace, hoping that Meredith Grey would help her get through her internship. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\n\nOn her first day, Sadie joined the interns practicing procedures on each other. She encouraged them to use fewer pain meds in order to avoid detection. She cut her own shoulder and offered to let them stitch it up. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering the interns. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\n\nSadie agreed to let one of the other interns cut out her appendix on the condition she could do the same for one of them. Lexie agreed and started to operate with an epidural. When they got to the appendix, they saw that it was inflamed, meaning it wasn't routine. Sadie also had severe hemorrhaging. They called Meredith and Cristina in, who finished the surgery with the help of Bailey, needing to remove a portion of her cecum to stop the bleeding. After the surgery, Sadie was put on probation with all the other interns. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nSadie examined [[Holly Anderson]] in the ER and failed to notice signs of a basilar skull fracture, which ultimately led to her death. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhile working on the case of [[Jackson Prescott]], Sadie noticed a black spot on his duodenum, meaning the organs weren't suitable for transplant. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[William Dunn]] started coding, Sadie tried to get Meredith to help him, but Meredith ordered Sadie to leave and find something else to do. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Mark broke his penis, the interns watched his surgery and gossiped about who had done it. Sadie saw how uncomfortable Lexie was, so she confessed despite knowing it was Lexie. She also guarded the door so Lexie could be with Mark after his surgery. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nLeo, Sadie, and Megan all had to work with Izzie in the clinic for a day. When they did procedures on patients, she also had them perform them on her. Sadie ended up mislabeling a patient's blood sample with the sample taken from Izzie.''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. Sadie incorrectly draped her patient and had to start over. She later cheated by listening in when Lexie \"diagnosed\" Mark. She also pointed the ultrasound wand at [[Jen Harmon|Jen Harmon's]] baby's butt instead of his heart. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nHer mistakes drew suspicion from George, who worried about her knowledge lagging behind where it should be. He offered to help her catch up, but she said she didn't need a tutor. George told her she could go to the Chief herself or he could. Rather than be known as a cheater, Sadie quit and left the hospital. Before leaving, she tried to convince Meredith to come with her and start travelling again to be free, but Meredith declined. It's possible that Sadie decided to travel on her own.\ua''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]] suspected that Sadie was flirting with her but she was never sure. Callie found her to be attractive. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhen traveling around Europe with [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], they had a fight in Amsterdam. They made up, but never were as close as before. When Cristina and Meredith were fighting, Sadie advised Meredith to apologize to prevent it from happening again with someone else. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\nHer arrival in [[Seattle]] caused some friction between herself and [[Cristina Yang]], as Yang is jealous of their close relationship. She formed a friendship with [[Lexie Grey]], after deciding that she \"maybe isn't such a priss\" and looking for allies. She proved her friendship to Lexie when she pretended to be the one to \"''break''\" [[Mark Sloan|Mark's]] penis, when the interns laughed at Lexie.\n\n\n[[File:Sadiecutsherself.jpg|thumb|left|px|Interns perform a surgery on Sadie.]]\nShe delayed her residency by working in a morgue before starting her internship at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]]. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nKnowing that she is not \"book smart,\" she came to Seattle Grace hoping Meredith could help her get through her internship.\n\nSadie began a friendship with fellow intern Lexie Grey, despite Meredith's warning that Lexie was naive, sheltered, and the kind of girl who grew up with \"parents and rules and smiley face posters on her wall.\" Joining the group of Seattle Grace surgical interns starving for a chance to practice their skills, Sadie volunteered herself for an appendectomy, so the other interns could practice and learn how to perform the procedure, provided she was given a chance afterwards at performing another procedure herself. Sadie's life was seriously endangered when the surgery went wrong, though fortunately Meredith and Cristina managed to save her. She was put on probation, along with the other interns, and rebuked by Meredith for her poor judgment, though later she told Lexie that she is not sorry. To try to let Lexie off her punishment, Sadie told the chief that the appendectomy was her idea and her own fault, but the chief said that the decision was up to him, telling her that the only reason she was still at the hospital was because of her father.\n\nSadie participated in [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie's]] game/competition for the interns, though her limited knowledge caused her to make serious mistakes in many of the tasks, such as draping a patient completely wrong for a [[Medical Glossary#W|whipple]] and using the doppler at \"the fetus's ass\" to find a heartbeat on an ultrasound. [[George O'Malley|George]] noticed that Sadie was falling behind and asked her to talk to the chief, finally giving her an ultimatum - talk to the chief, or he will. As a result, Sadie quit, with George hinting to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] that she may have cheated her way into the surgical program. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\n*Sadie and Meredith have given each other nicknames; \"die\" and \"death\" respectively, playing off of their names (Sa'''die''' and Mere'''death''').\n*[[Lexie Grey]] mentions she is  in\ua\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\".\n*Her father must be either wealthy or someone with a lot of influence\uasince [[Richard Webber]] stated that she was only still at the hospital because of her father.<ref>[[All By Myself]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nSadieHarris.png|[[These Ties That Bind]]\nSadieHarris.png|[[In the Midnight Hour]]\nSadieHarris.png|[[All By Myself]]\nSadieHarris.png|[[Wish You Were Here]]\nSadieHarris.png|[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\nSadieHarris.png|[[Stairway to Heaven]]\nSadieHarris.png|[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\nSadieHarris.png|[[Before and After]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Sadie Harris Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Sadie Harris]]\n[[fr:Sadie Harris]]\n[[es:Sadie Harris]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harris, Sadie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Because she'd been detained at the border with her mother, her father didn't know how long she'd been in pain and the detention center only gave her an antacid to treat her. She had an intestinal blockage, which they were unable to resolve with an enema. She was then taken into surgery, where they took a biopsy while they resolved her blockage. The biopsy diagnosed her with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Because her father was uninsured, but made too much money to qualify for Medicaid for Gabby, Meredith used [[Ellis Shepherd|her daughter's]] name and insurance on the paperwork to get it covered. When Richard found out about it, he was upset that she'd committed insurance fraud, but knew of a program that would kick in after  days if they could keep Gabby in the hospital the whole time, so they had to get creative about ways to justify her continuous time in the hospital. In the meantime, they encouraged Luis to go back to work to occupy his time and offered him a cot so he could sleep in Gabby's room with her.

Amelia and Meredith were both familiar with their work. They met Meredith and Amelia when they came to Minnesota to hear David Hamilton's pitch for them to work together to cure Parkinson's Disease. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nKai continued to work with Amelia after Amelia returned to Seattle, using video calls to share research. Kai then asked if Amelia could return to Minnesota soon to help them work out some kinks. Amelia said she would. Kai then helped Amelia get some relief from the heat by having her imagine being somewhere very cold. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nTheir research continued when Amelia and Meredith returned to Minnesota, along with newly-recruited Tom Koracick. In order to get approval for the next step, they first had to prove to the FDA that the cells would survive, so they began running trials to figure out a way to keep the cells from dying with the help of some gel brains provided by Tom. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nOn Thanksgiving, they sent Amelia a video, taken the night before, of a mechanized injector that allowed them to inject the cells without them clumping. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nWhen David fell, he put pressure on the team to work more quickly to meet the FDA's requirements to get compassionate release so he could get treated soon. Kai, [[Gavin Hawj|Gavin]], and Amelia ran trial after trial all day, trying various things to improve cell viability. When several trials failed, Kai took a fifteen minute break and got some chips. They and Amelia talked about the project while walking around. Amelia asked if Kai had ever worked on something for years that ultimately didn't go anywhere. They said no, but they had done months. Afteward, they rented a house in Hawaii for the summer, learned to surf and grow their own pineapple, then came back and started again. Finally, Amelia had the idea to cool the needle they were using to inject the cells to keep them cool. They tried various temperatures and one gave them % cell viability, enough to satisfy the FDA and allow for compassionate use. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\nThe FDA gave them a small window to do the surgery. Knowing that doing it in Minnesota would draw too much attention, Kai and David flew to Seattle to do the surgery at Grey Sloan instead. However, Kai determined that David had a low-grade fever, forcing them to cancel his surgery. The fever turned out to be due to a perforated bowel, so he had surgery on that instead. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nDavid's surgery went well, but both Meredith and Kai admonished him for not admitting to the pain sooner, as it jeopardized all their work. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nWhen Hamilton was sufficiently healed from his abdominal surgery, they prepared to do the experimental treatment. On the day of, Kai said all the cells were within the temperature range. Once everything was ready, Hamilton was taken to the OR. Hamilton had wanted the surgery to be private, but Meredith told him it was a teaching hospital, so she wanted to open the surgery up to all hospital staff to watch, which many of them did. As they did the final preparations, Kai awkwardly explained what they'd done to the residents. Then they proceeded with the surgery. There was a brief hiccup when Amelia was paged for another surgery, but Tom went in her place, allowing her to continue. The rest of the surgery went forward without incident. After it was over, Kai wondered how Amelia could have even considered leaving the OR until they realized that Amelia loves so deeply and fiercely. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\nWith the surgery a success, Kai and Amelia worked together to complete their report. They decided they needed to make Hamilton's bowel obstruction seem less like his own fault, so they carefully worded that section of the report. Once they were finished, Kai invited Amelia to a show, where they performed with their band. At the end of the night, Amelia went home with Kai and they had sex. The next morning, Kai told Amelia she could stay, but Amelia said she had to leave because she's a mom and she missed her son whenever she was in Minnesota. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen David surprised Meredith with a job offer after she presented his case to the staff at the Mayo Clinic, Kai encouraged her to consider it, saying that David was really a kind, supportive guy. Kai knew him before they changed their name and pronouns and he never once mixed up and said they were brave and that he was proud of them. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nKai and David came to Seattle on Richard's request to test his skills to see if he needed to retire. Before the testing started, Kai talked to Amelia, who said that Richard needed to pass the test. The testing began and took several hours. The testing was interrupted when Richard got a call from Levi Schmitt and left to help him treat his mother, causing Kai to question his judgment, as he hadn't said a word to them before leaving. While Richard spoke to [[Jamarah Blake]] and [[MaryAnn Suchan]] about the residency program, they taped Levi Schmitt speaking about his own experience with the team. Richard then returned to the testing room and completed his tests. Kai told him he'd passed. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nKai attended the party at Meredith's house for everyone to get to know Nick. At the party, they ended up playing hide and seek with Meredith's children. Later in the party, they talked to Amelia outside and said they never want children and meeting Scout at the party made him real in a way he hadn't been before. They said they didn't want to lead Amelia on, as they'd been led on before. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nNot long after the party, the article Kai, Amelia, and Meredith wrote about David's case was published. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nKai came to Seattle to surprise Amelia. Because Amelia was working, Kai decided to get some work done in a lab. While they were there, they learned that [[Zola Grey Shepherd]] had mastered several difficult puzzles. They told Meredith Zola was extremely gifted. ''(\"[[Let's Talk About Sex]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nKai and Amelia began flirting with each other shortly after their first meeting. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nFinally, one night, they each attempted to be the last person out of the lab. Kai said they were typically the last one to leave, but agreed to leave first so Amelia could win some points with Hamilton. Before they left, Kai asked about Amelia's family, whom Tom had mentioned. Amelia told Kai about her son and his dad, but then said she was single. Kai said they were also single. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nAfter a major breakthrough in their research, they asked Amelia to go get dinner, but Amelia had to catch a flight back to Seattle. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\nWhen Kai and David came to Seattle for David's surgery, Kai and Amelia kissed outside the hospital after Amelia used guided meditation to help Kai calm down. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nAfter Owen's surgery, Kai met Amelia at Joe's, where Amelia explained that her life was messy. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nOnce Hamilton's surgery was successfully completed, Kai and Amelia worked together to finish their report. They finished and then Kai invited Amelia to their band's performance. After the performance, Amelia went home with Kai and they had sex. The next morning, Kai told Amelia she didn't have to leave, but Amelia insisted that she did because she was a mom who missed her son. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\nAt Meredith's party, Kai ended things between them after meeting Scout, because they never wanted children and didn't want to lead Amelia on any longer. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\nAfter the breakup, they texted that they missed Amelia. Later, they came to the hospital and told Amelia they couldn't sleep and the two of them kissed. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nTheir mother wanted them to go to medical school. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\nThey have a sister with children. Their grandmother constantly nags them about having children.

When she was evacuated to the US for medical treatment, he wasn't able to go with her because she couldn't get a visa for him. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n\nAfter seeing Megan's distress at not being able to be with Farouk, Nathan went to Iraq himself and had Farouk fake an illness so he could take Farouk to the US under the guise of participating in a medical trial. When he arrived, they tried to delay his entry while waiting on paperwork, but Meredith convinced them that his condition was critical enough not to wait, so he was taken to the hospital and happily reunited with his mom. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Megan was released from the hospital, she decided to move to the beach with Farouk and Nathan. She sent Nathan and Farouk ahead to set up the [[Megan and Nathan's House|house]]. While they worked, Farouk and Nathan bonded, agreeing that even though they didn't know what they were doing, they were prepared to muddle through together because they both love Megan. Megan later joined them and they went to the beach together and played happily. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n\nMegan and Farouk came to Seattle for Teddy and Owen's wedding. The wedding was initially supposed to take place in a park, but before the priest could finish the ceremony, a couple on a tandem bicycle crashed into him, seriously injuring both him and the couple. After the priest died, Megan stepped in and performed the ceremony at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nFarouk came to the hospital with his mother, who was concerned because he'd been getting short of breath more easily and his ankles were swollen. After an exam and some tests, Cormac diagnosed him with constrictive pericarditis and said he'd probably need surgery to correct it. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Farouk's surgery, Farouk revealed that he'd looked into Winston's surgical reputation and learned good things. He was taken into surgery, which went smoothly. However, when they finished, they discovered his heart had swollen and wouldn't fit in his chest cavity. They injected epinephrine and waited for the swelling to go down. When it did, they were able to close and Farouk was taken to recovery. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nFarouk was still in the hospital on Thanksgiving. He played Monopoly with Megan, Teddy, and Cormac to pass some time. Later in the day, Farouk went into v-fib. Teddy ran the code for thirty minutes before Cormac said there was no saving his heart. He said they needed to put Farouk on ECMO, then they got him put on the transplant list for a new heart. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nWhen a heart became available in Tacoma, Teddy, Owen and Cormac went to retrieve it. While they were gone, Winston took Farouk into the OR so he would be ready when the heart arrived. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhen the heart arrived, Winston examined it and saw that it was bruised from the car accident that occurred on the way to the hospital. He consulted with Maggie, who recommended discarding it and waiting for the next heart. However, Winston decided to go forward with the transplant anyway, believing Farouk didn't have time to wait for another heart. They completed the transplant and the heart began beating strongly in Farouk's chest. They were able to close and move him back to his room.

Because she wasn't in combat areas, when she returned to the US, she was reluctant to take advantage of services meant to help veterans, feeling that it would take them away from soldiers who were injured during their service. However, after her surgery, Owen talked to her and convinced her that she had given what she was able to give, but had still served her country, meaning she was entitled to the same services as those who had served in combat. He also encouraged her to volunteer, working to help other veterans, but told her that she needed to get back on her own feet before she could do that.\n\n\nWhen Melissa returned to the US after serving in Iraq, she found that the job she had lined up was gone and her fianc\ue, as well as the apartment they shared, was gone as well. She was only able to find work at Office Hub, but it didn't pay well enough to afford rent, so she began living out of her car. One day, while she was sleeping, carjackers broke her window and tried to pull her out of the car. She tried to hang on as long as she could and was dragged by the car for a while. But the carjackers punched and kicked her until she couldn't hold on any longer. She was found by a co-worker, [[Keith (Don't Let's Start)|Keith]], on his way into work. He called an ambulance and she was taken to the ER.\n\nAt the hospital, she was taken into a trauma room, where they had to perform an emergency laparotomy as they didn't have time to take her to an OR. Once they had packed her abdomen, she was taken to the OR, where her internal injuries were repaired and her leg fracture was cleaned out. Her tibia repair was scheduled for the following day. When she woke after her first surgery, she was concerned about her car. The police said they found the pieces of it in a chop shop, which was devastating for her as the car was all she had. It held all of her belongings and her clothes, as well as all her savings and her insurance paperwork.\n\nHer tibia repair went well, but afterward, the doctors talked to her about her homelessness and offered to set her up with services for homeless veterans. She declined their offers and asked them not to say anything to her co-workers, who had come to her hospital room to see her.\n\nOwen later came into her room with pamphlets for the programs, pulling rank on her to force her to listen to him before explaining to her why she had the right to them as much as any other veteran.\n\n\n\nMelissa was engaged.

And then I found out that you'd been hired here, and I thought, \"Well, crap.\" And then I realized, well, crap, I have to figure out a way to get back here somehow. And now I'm in an OR with the Maggie Pierce... |'''Leah Murphy''' to '''[[Maggie Pierce]]'''}}\n\n'''Leah Murphy'''\uais a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She was fired during her second year of residency because she wasn't fit to be a surgeon, but later returned to their residency program after working hard to improve herself at another hospital.\n\n\n\nWhen she was , she believed she wanted to be a radiologist. Her mother briefly dated\ua[[Mark Sloan]] and he helped Leah to get in the surgical program at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n\nA couple of months into her internship, Leah started to make out with Alex in a supply closet for the last time before he left for Hopkins. They had had sex a couple of times already, as Alex slept with nearly every intern. Just as he was giving her the goodbye speech he used on every other intern, they were interrupted by Callie, who was crying in the closet as they came in kissing. Leah apologized and quickly got out of the room. While watching the intern appy, the interns talked about how mean [[Meredith Grey|Medusa]] was and Leah questioned if Medusa had always been Medusa. They soon stopped when Owen pointed out that the intercom was on and Meredith had heard everything they said. Along with the others, Leah was shocked as Meredith bumped Jo aside when she froze in the OR.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nDuring one of Derek's boring lectures about inserting a central line, Leah talked to Jo and Stephanie about a patient in the hospital with scrotal lymphedema. During a practice, Leah was shown not to be very good at placing central lines, as she still didn't manage to do it correctly after several failed attempts. The next day, she, Jo, and Stephanie went to look at Brian's giant testicles, about which Leah kind of exaggerated as she described them as \"so big a sheet couldn't cover them\", until Meredith chased them away. Before Derek could start another lecture, they asked him if they could go watch Meredith remove the rare tumor. He thought Meredith wasn't removing a tumor, as she had told him she wasn't going to do it, but he stormed out when Leah told him she and Dr. Brooks were in the OR at that moment.<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jo brought up how mean Alex was to her, Leah asked Jo if he said anything about her. Stephanie told her not to be the sad girl with the hang-up, as it's pathetic. She asked why she'd even start her year with having sex with her boss. \"Because he's stupid hot!\" Leah replied. However, Leah didn't let it go and later approached Jo. She asked if it may be something that she did to make him stop talking to her. She didn't understand, as things were really heating up and suddenly, he stopped returning her texts. He barely talked to her and she couldn't figure out what happened between them. Jo told her what happened is that he's a guy. Leah asked if that meant they were done. Jo simply said that she should be done with him, but Leah still asked if he was done. Jo told her to stop and proposed she started something with Shane as he was nice, but unfortunately, she didn't like nice. Jo pointed out that she picked the right guy then, as Karev was mean. And thoughtless and a douche, Leah added. That day, Leah was on Bailey's service. Bailey planned to get Arizona back to the hospital and acted as if she had ordered Leah to deliver a chart at Arizona's house, though she hadn't ordered Leah anything and used Leah's \"stupidness\" as an excuse to make Arizona come to the hospital for the chart.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nWhile competing with [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] while they were both on [[Cristina Yang|Cristina's]] service, they were both indefinitely banned from the OR when their fighting led to Leah hooking up a [[Mrs. Crossley|patient's]] oxygen to her IV, a potentially fatal mistake.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n\nShe sat with [[Richard Webber]] while Bailey and Meredith operated on [[Adele Webber|Adele]] and he explained to her, everything that they were doing.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah was on Bailey's service, afraid to make another mistake and be thrown off, seeing as she'd already messed up two times. When she and Bailey checked\ua[[Joyce Basche]], a person they had performed a surgery on weeks before, she had a post-operative infection. Soon after, another former patient of theirs came up with the same infection. Leah was in charge of both of their post-op care, and Leah had a cold the day she operated on both of them with Bailey. When\ua[[Seth Lepik]]\uashowed up with the infection, Leah seemed doomed, but as it turned out, she never touched Seth, and the only doctor who touched all three patients was Bailey. Bailey was found as the source of the infection, so Leah was innocent the whole time.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile the hospital was dealing with the mudslide patients, [[Heather Brooks|Heather]] was being treated. When Leah went to scrub in on a surgery, [[Callie Torres|Callie]] offered to give her time if she needed it, but she declined and scrubbed in. She, Stephanie, and Jo later got into a disagreement over whether or not Stephanie liked Heather.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Heather died, the other interns were given time off. Derek told them to think of happy Heather stories for her mother, but they realized they didn't have any as they were not very close to her. They went to Meredith and she told them a story about George stealing jello for all of them, a story she had shared with George's mother when he died. They used alcohol from Alex to get drunk and bond, but when Heather's mother arrived, they still didn't have a story to tell her, so they stole Meredith's George story, as well as using a question Stephanie had asked Jo and changing it to involve Heather. Using their newfound bond, the four of them went out to the pile as a group to help.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the interns began all sleeping at Alex's house and studying. Jo was waiting for Alex to proposition her so they could have sex and Alex was waiting because he thought she was still grieving, so he said they could stay there as long as they wanted. Jo went to the others and said that they needed to leave.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn the night of the\ua[[Puttin' on the Ritz|fundraising gala]], [[Arizona Robbins]]\uaand\ua[[April Kepner]]\uabonded over drinks in the hospital storage closet. Since they were too intoxicated to drive, Leah called them a cab. Shortly thereafter, Leah called to make sure the girls arrived home safely and ended up visiting Arizona at her apartment. The two watched movies and talked all night (though Arizona remembered none of it). Worried about what took place that night, Arizona asked Leah if anything happened between them and Leah told her nothing had.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, the two ended up making out on a different occasion, causing Leah to become somewhat obsessed with Arizona (much like she did with Alex). Arizona rebuffed her obsession and ended things. Leah told Arizona that she respected her so much and the thought of Arizona thinking about her in that way made her feel amazing. That night, Arizona texted Leah asking 'What are you up to?' implying that she wanted her to come over.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nOn the morning of\ua[[Thriller|Halloween]], Leah woke up in Arizona's hotel bed. She got ready to leave, waking up Arizona. Arizona said that she didn't have to leave. Leah said she knew she wasn't supposed to sleep over and apologized, but Arizona said it was okay. Leah thought it wasn't, as she was all about easy. At the hospital, Leah got bit in the neck by a drug addict and was tested for HIV. Arizona helped calm her worry. She told Leah a similar story to reach out to her. Her rapid HIV test was negative.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nWhen talking about April's wedding, Leah said she didn't want to go because she didn't want to see Arizona being beautiful there. Later, she decided she was going to go to the wedding and demand what she felt she deserved, but she immediately figured out that that was a bad idea.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nShe agreed to cover Jo's patients for her while Jo went to April's wedding, but was over her hours, so Shane showed her how to modify her hours so it looked like she worked fewer hours than she had. While Jo was gone, Jimmy had a heart attack. She and Shane took him into surgery by themselves. In surgery, Shane began to panic after things went poorly and started to refer to the patient as \"she,\" so Leah left the OR to find someone. She found Richard and brought him back into the OR so he could attempt to fix the damage Shane had done. By the time Richard got back into the OR, Shane had completely frozen and was just staring into Jimmy's chest cavity. Richard talked to Shane and sent him out of the OR so he could operate.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\nAfterward, she looked for Shane and wasn't able to find him.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter finding Stephanie miserable on the stairs and talking to her about how Jackson treated Stephanie and Arizona treated Leah, Leah decided that someone should do something about it.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\nShe filed a sexual harassment claim, which resulted in a non-fraternization policy being enacted at the hospital.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that Leah had filed the complaint against [[Callie Torres|Callie]], not [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] as previously believed. When Arizona tried to send Leah away when she came to scrub in with her, Leah asked if she really wanted to do that. Arizona operated with Leah and taught her during the surgery.<ref>[[Throwing it All Away]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of who had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAt Richard's birthday party, Owen asked him to be director of the residency program because he noticed how well he'd been mentoring the residents.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Leah contracted the virus that was going around the hospital, Richard encouraged her not to go home. She attempted to power through, even hooking herself up to an IV while operating, but was ultimately sent home when she vomited in the OR behind her mask.<ref>[[You Be Illin']], x</ref>\n\nDerek, warned that he wasn't teaching enough, took all the residents to work on a case with him that he had rescheduled several times. As the OR wasn't available until  AM, he then took them to the ER to work on the incoming patients, including having them work on a patient who was already dead so they could work with real brain tissue. When a man came in with scissors puncturing his forehead, they took him into an OR for a controlled extraction. When Leah was unable to pull them out quickly, Jo took over and pulled them out. Then they went back to the case of [[Nova Jenkins]]. Each of the residents took a turn to step up to the microscope and ask a question so they could learn. When it was Leah's turn, she made a mistake that could have caused permanent damage. However, after surgery, Nova woke up and was responsive. Derek told Leah she got lucky, but next time, she might not get so lucky. He encouraged her to remember the feeling of not knowing rather than the feeling of relief, so she wouldn't make the same mistake again.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working on [[Francesca McNeil]], Leah had to put a stitch in a heart that she had never done before. She did the stitch successfully, but there were other complications and Frankie died in the OR. She spoke to Shane, who assured her that it was nothing that she did.<ref>[[Change of Heart]], x</ref>\n\n\nThe residents were part of the group operating on [[Annie Cooper (We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together)|Annie]] and [[Liz Cooper]]. Leah was selected to do the burr holes, but she was nervous about it because she had previously drilled through a table. In surgery, she was able to do the burr holes without puncturing the dura.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter hearing that a resident was going to be fired, Leah began to stress eat. Richard invited her to work with him that day. When she came up with the idea to use a magnetic sphincter normally used at the bottom of the esophagus in a patient's anus, she scrubbed in on the surgery with Richard. He coached her throughout the surgery. Leah asked to stay on the case and be there for follow-ups, but Richard pulled her aside and told her that her surgical skills were lacking. She was an excellent doctor, but surgery was not the right fit for her. He told her to find where she could be great and offered to put in a good word for her at a research facility.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Leah heard about the [[Mall Explosion|explosion]] at the mall, she came into the hospital even though she had been fired. She worked on several patients, but once things had calmed down and there wasn't anything for her to do, she took off her gown and left the hospital.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter leaving Grey Sloan, Leah worked at Foster Hospital. She spent the time improving her skills and discovering that she wanted to be a cardiothoracic surgeon. In particular, she wanted to study under [[Maggie Pierce]] after reading a paper she'd published. When she learned Maggie was working at Grey Sloan, she worked to get re-hired there.<ref>[[Roar]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah was ultimately re-hired after proving herself. Her return was immediately awkward, with multiple doctors speculating about why she had returned and what would happen. Despite this, Maggie took a shine to her after seeing her technique. When Maggie learned that Leah had previously been fired, she observed Leah more closely in surgery and quizzed her as she worked. Leah knew what she was doing and then told Maggie what she'd done to earn her spot back at the hospital.<ref>[[Roar]], x</ref>\n\nDespite all her hard work, Leah admitted she sometimes still had trouble following Maggie's train of thought, making it difficult to learn from her. Leah presumably told\ua[[Eliza Minnick]], the education consultant hired by Bailey, about this during the meeting with the residents and interns.<ref>[[Why Try to Change Me Now]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a building collapsed, the hospital was flooded with incoming traumas. Leah treated [[Micah (You Haven't Done Nothin')|Micah]], who asked for a priest. When one wasn't available, Leah brought Ben to talk to Micah instead and they were both shocked to learn that Micah, the landlord, knew the building wasn't structurally sound.<ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Jo had been sent home to get some sleep, Leah and Stephanie brought over pizza. Jo tried to send them away, but agreed to let them come in. Stephanie wanted to have a strategy session, to talk about what to do to improve their chances. They then surprised her by telling her Alex wasn't in prison as she thought.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah tended to [[Matty]] when he came into the ER. However, Stephanie took over the case shortly afterward.<ref>[[It Only Gets Much Worse]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah Murphy is the perfect example of a mean girl on the outside, but a sweet and complex girl on the inside. She comes across as somewhat cold and selfish, but in fact she cares a great deal about the people around her. Like her fellow interns, she is very competitive, but she is also very insecure (about her skills and herself in general). Leah also tends to become infatuated with anyone who shows the smallest bit of interest in her (which stems from her insecurities).\n\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShe had a brief sexual relationship with [[Alex Karev]]. Contrary to him, she thought it was more than just sex and got really attached to him. He then broke off their relationship, after which she obsessed about why he stopped contacting her.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nOn the night of the fundraising gala, [[Arizona Robbins]] and [[April Kepner]] bonded over drinks in the hospital storage closet. Since they were too intoxicated to drive, Leah called them a cab.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref> Shortly thereafter, Leah called to make sure the girls arrived home safely and ended up visiting Arizona at her apartment. The two watched movies and talked all night (though Arizona remembered none of it). Worried about what took place that night, Arizona asked Leah if anything happened between them and Leah told her nothing had.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, the two ended up making out on a different occasion, causing Leah to become somewhat obsessed with Arizona (much like she did with Alex). Arizona rebuffed her obsession and ended things. Leah told Arizona that she respected her so much and the thought of Arizona thinking about her in that way made her feel amazing. That night Arizona texted Leah saying 'What are you up to?' implying that she wanted her to come over.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Halloween, Leah woke up next to Arizona in her hotel room. She got ready to leave, waking up Arizona. Arizona said that she didn't have to leave. Leah said she knew she wasn't supposed to sleep over and apologized, but Arizona said it was okay. Leah thought it wasn't, as she was all about easy. At the hospital, Leah got bit in the neck by a drug-addict and was tested for HIV. Arizona helped calm her worry. She told Leah a similar story to reach out to her.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nAfter [[Callie Torres|Callie]] won her malpractice suit and spoke to her father about his marriage to her mother, she came to Arizona's hotel room to ask her to come home. Unbeknownst to Callie, Leah was in the room with Arizona. Once Callie was gone, Arizona lay on the bed and told Leah to get dressed and leave.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\nLess than a week after Arizona had moved back in with Callie, Leah had to scrub in with the two of them. Callie knew that Arizona had been with someone while they were separated, but didn't know who. After Leah freaked out in surgery after making a mistake and was unable to calm down, she turned to Arizona for help, revealing to Callie that it had been her. After the surgery, Arizona asked Leah what she was thinking and she said that Callie hated her and would blame her for what happened between the two of them because she loved Arizona too much to blame her.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah's mother once dated [[Mark Sloan]]. Mark later helped Leah get into the internship program at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nShe also has an uncle who has suffered from debilitating facial pain since having LASIK eye surgery. He was an accountant, but had to give up his practice because he couldn't do math anymore.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah Murphy is a [[General Surgery|surgical]]\ua[[resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\nAs a surgical [[Internship|intern]], Leah's competitive nature\ualed her to be\uacalled a shark by fellow intern [[Stephanie Edwards]]. While on [[Cristina Yang|Cristina Yang's]] service, she\uagot reprimanded for\uaaccidentally almost killing a patient and\uawas banned from the O.R. until further notice. Later, also while on Yang's service, she tried to administer blood instead of fluids to a patient who was a Jehovah's Witness. Leah was caught and thrown off of Yang's service.\n\nSoon after the superstorm, Leah passed her [[United States Medical Licensing Exam#Step |intern exam]] and became a second-year resident.\n\nDuring her second year residency, Leah was fired because even though she had everything it takes to be a good doctor, she was not a good surgeon. Webber offered to pull some strings to get her a position at a research facility where she could put all her talents to use. However, Leah didn't follow up on that offer and got herself into the program at Foster, where she practiced and worked hard to become the best.\n\nDuring her time at Foster, Murphy read a published article by [[Maggie Pierce|Dr. Maggie Pierce]] and it solidified Murphy's interest in [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]]. This led her to apply for a resident-transfer to Grey Sloan Memorial. Webber reviewed her application and accepted the transfer. He admitted that Murphy had proved him wrong and that she was deserving of a second chance.\n\n\n*Cristina originally considered calling her Droopy, and Doc, but later decided to call her Perky.

He originally married [[Ellis Grey]], but they divorced and he later married [[Susan Grey]].\ua\n\n\n\nVery little is known about Thatcher Grey's history. At some point, he met and fell in love with Ellis Grey. After their wedding, they had Meredith Grey. When Meredith was five, Ellis left Thatcher. Some time after their divorce, he met Susan Grey, married her, and had two daughters (Lexie Grey and Molly Grey). He did not try to contact Meredith during the time of their -year estrangement. However, he remarried and when they ended up back at Seattle Grace Hospital when Molly was pregnant, Susan, Thatcher's new wife, encouraged them to bond.\n\n\nAfter the realization that she didn't want to make confessional tapes on her deathbed, Meredith looked up her father's address and went to visit him. She asked him why he didn't try harder to stay with her mother and why he just left. He asked if there was anything she needed but\uaMeredith\uasaid that she didn't want anything from him\uaand left. ''(\"[[Yesterday]]\")''\n\n\nThatcher later came to the hospital with his new wife, Susan, and their younger daughter, Molly, when Molly was pregnant. During his visit, Meredith avoided him, not wanting to see him. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\nWhen Laura was four days old, Thatcher was sent to check on Laura because Susan and Molly both had the flu and couldn't. While he was sitting with her, her stomach became distended and he had to give authorization so they could take her into emergency surgery. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\nThatcher was at the hospital with Laura while she recovered from her surgery, visiting her and updating her mother and grandmother on her condition. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Molly was taken in for an emergency c-section, Thatcher was at [[Harvard Medical School]], visiting Lexie. ''(\"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Ellis died, Susan and Thatcher came to the hospital to check on Meredith, to make sure she was okay. Susan also invited Meredith to dinner. Derek convinced her to move the dinner to her own house and said he'd be there to support her. Cristina also volunteered to interrupt  minutes in with a fake crisis in case she needed to bail. When the power went out during dinner, Thatcher left to go flip the fuse, but stayed in the laundry room, needing a break from the dinner. He and Derek chatted about Meredith. Eventually, Thatcher restored the power and rejoined the dinner. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\n\nThatcher came to the hospital with Susan when she had prolonged acid reflux and persistent hiccups. While Susan was in for a procedure that they hoped would stop the reflux, Meredith and Thatcher talked and bonded. They even speculated that Susan was faking the hiccups in order to get them to talk. Thatcher later took Susan home after her procedure. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nThatcher came back to the hospital when Susan had a fever. They started antibiotics for an infection and while she was getting a central line placed, Meredith and Thatcher had lunch in the cafeteria. Susan later had to be rushed into surgery with a very rare complication. Despite their best efforts, she died in surgery. When Meredith delivered the news to him, he slapped her, saying that Susan had trusted her and she let her down. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Susan's funeral, Thatcher came to the hospital drunk and told Meredith not to come. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Susan's death, Thatcher started drinking heavily. Once, when he was trying to go to the store after drinking, Alex offered to go for him to pick up his scotch to keep him from driving drunk. ''(\"[[Physical Attraction... Chemical Reaction]]\")''\n\nAs a result of his alcoholism, he was admitted to [[Seattle Grace Hospital|SGH]] for drunkenness and having his arm put through a window. Meredith stitched him up and they bonded again. Lexie later told Meredith that it was only because he was drunk and that he has mood swings. She gives an example by saying that one day he wrote her a check for  thousand dollars because she deserved everything life had to offer, but just before that, he had called her an ungrateful bitch. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Thatcher and [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]].]]\n\nAfter alienating everyone, he went into rehab and he soon visited Seattle Grace, twenty-nine days sober. [[Richard Webber]] paged the two Grey sisters to his office to listen to Thatcher. After listening to his apology, Meredith wished him good luck, congratulated him, and left. Lexie hugged him and forgave him. That night, he went to dinner at [[Camparos]] with Lexie and Mark. ''(\"[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]]\")''\n\n\nHe is next seen at the hospital with liver disease that was a result of his alcoholism. He was told he needed a liver transplant to survive. UNOS would not allow him to go on the transplant list as he had only been sober for  days and he needed to be at least sober for  year. Lexie automatically volunteered, as it would only mean her losing some of her liver, but she was not a match. Meredith was a match and after some discussion, both Meredith and Thatcher agreed to the operation and it was successful. ''(\"[[Tainted Obligation]]\")''\n\n\nThatcher came to the Christmas party at [[Meredith's House]]. While he was there, he noticed that [[Richard Webber]] was drinking eggnog and warned Meredith about his drinking, though she wasn't concerned. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n\nThatcher came into the hospital with abdominal pain. After some tests, he was diagnosed with a kidney stone which was so large that Bailey operated to remove it. His surgery went well. ''(\"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\")''\n\n\nAfter hearing from a student about their semester abroad, Thatcher decided to make a trip to Zimbabwe himself after Lexie died. He loved it. He came home when he got sick, figuring he'd get it treated and then go back. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Lexie died, Thatcher stayed sober, but lost touch with Meredith. Richard found out through an AA friend that Thatcher had Acute Myeloid Leukemia and is in hospice care\uawith only a few weeks left to live. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\nMeredith avoided visiting him until she learned that Thatcher might not have even a few more days. She came to his house to visit and they talked awkwardly for a while. He told her about Zimbabwe and apologized to her for his absence after Lexie's death. He did tell her he'd come to Derek's funeral, but didn't talk to her because he knew it would be for him and not for her. After this revelation, conversation came easier. She helped him move to his bed when he had difficulty breathing and she told him about Maggie and her kids. When he expressed his regret that he didn't know them, she told him about them. After she finished, he took his final breath and died. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nAlbeit awkward, Thatcher is a loving father to his second family and although he was intimidated when Meredith came to see him years after his divorce with Ellis, he still cared for her in his own way. Susan constantly encouraged him to renew his relationship with Meredith and after a while, they did. However, Susan died very suddenly at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and Thatcher lashed out at Meredith and blamed her for Susan's death, slapping her in the face. He later forbade Meredith to come to Susan's funeral service.\n\n\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\nThey were married for about seven years before his wife began having an affair with [[Richard Webber]]. Eventually, Ellis's affair and time away from home put too much strain on their marriage, and Ellis left with Meredith.\n\nMeredith was a small child at the time of the divorce, and roughly twenty years would pass before they saw each other again. Thatcher blames Ellis somewhat for his estrangement from Meredith, saying Ellis was \"cold\" and wouldn't let him get to know his daughter.\n\n[[Susan Grey]]\nAfter the disintegration of his first family, Thatcher married his second wife, Susan, and had two more daughters, Lexie and Molly. Susan eventually died, causing Thatcher to develop a serious drinking problem.\n\n[[Danielle]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Thatcher introduces Danielle and Lexie.]]\nThatcher met Danielle at one of his AA meetings. They apparently hit it off and he said that she makes him a better person, though he did not inform Lexie that he was dating again. Danielle also had a drinking problem, but had been sober for a while. Lexie originally referred to her as a \"tatted-up skank\", feeling embarrassed and sad that her father had a new girlfriend and had not confided in her. Later on, Lexie apologized to Danielle, and became more friendly. ''(\"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\")''\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith never knew what it was like to have a father, and even went so far as to tell Thatcher this when he came to the hospital for a liver transplant. She never really forgave Thatcher for not fighting for her when he had the chance, and is very cold towards him. They started to make amends when his wife Susan pushed them to, but after Susan's sudden death, Thatcher slapped Meredith, blaming her for his wife's death. Later, when he stopped drinking and told Meredith, she merely wished him good luck. When Thatcher was close to death, Meredith decided to visit him, and they were able to work out things between them. She kept him company until his death.\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nLexie was the daughter of Thatcher and Susan, and they all had a loving family. Thatcher was extremely proud of Lexie's achievements, and as their younger child Molly said, Lexie was the topic of boasting for Thatcher when she began to study medicine in Harvard. Lexie believed that Thatcher was the best father, telling Meredith that he even went to her th grade graduation, which \"wasn't even real\". Lexie was devastated when she did not have a matching liver to her father, but rather Meredith did, and she begged Meredith to give up a piece of her liver to keep Thatcher alive.\n\n\nThatcher was an English professor. When Ellis thought that George was Thatcher, she screamed at him and told him that she didn't care how his day was or about his grants and his students. Meredith also mentioned to Izzie that during dinner with Susan and her father they had discussed his research. It was stated by Meredith that Thatcher got his first job at a university after Ellis \"pulled a few strings\" when she was offered a job.\n\n\n*Both Ellis and [[Richard Webber]] think that [[George O'Malley|George]] bears a slight resemblance to Thatcher.\n*He snored loudly, a trait which his eldest daughter, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], inherited.<ref>[[Six Days, Part ]], x</ref>\n*He had the same blood type as his daughter, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], AB.<ref>[[Tainted Obligation]], x</ref>\n*He liked scotch and gin.<ref>[[Tainted Obligation]], x</ref>\n*His phone number was () -.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Yesterday]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[The Name of the Game]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Six Days, Part ]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Six Days, Part ]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Testing --]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Physical Attraction...

Before surgery, she had her doctors swear on \"The book,\" a copy of ''The Odyssey,'' that they would do their best work. They took her in for what should have been a straight-forward tumor resection, but when they got in there, they realized the tumor had grown quickly, wrapping around her heart and making their scans useless. They did a temporary abdominal closure and got new scans so they could develop a new surgical plan. When they saw that scans weren't enough, they printed a D rendering of the tumor to help them visualize the anatomy. With that, they began to develop a new surgical plan. However, while they were developing their new plan, Adrian started bleeding, so she had to be taken back into surgery immediately. They followed the plan they had developed up to the point where they hadn't planned anymore and then they had to make up a plan as they operated. They did so successfully and removed the whole tumor.\n\n\n\nAdrian is married to [[Michael Nelson]].

Raj later came to where they had taken Shane and fought with them over whether he was a psych patient or a surgical patient. Surgery ultimately won. ''(\"[[Something to Talk About]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the doctors discovered that Bex Singleton was intersex, they consulted with psych and Raj told Bex's parents that most intersex individuals start to identify very strongly with one sex and it's not always the one they've been raised. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\n\nHe was called in to consult on Jesse Fannon, who had OCD that caused a car accident. He explained Jesse's condition to Cristina.

''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Claire Nolan came into the ER, confused and seeming delusional, Raj examined her and tentatively diagnosed her with schizophrenia. When her parents arrived at the hospital, information her mother gave supported that diagnosis. He said they'd stabilize her with haloperidol and then there were other medications they could try. He also offered support programs to her family to help them. ''(\"[[Back Where You Belong]]\")''\n\n\nDr. Raj Sen is a [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].

And I want you guys to get on the next plane out here and meet my girl. Everything's going to be different now.|'''Denny's''' voice mail to his parents.}}\n\n'''Denny Duquette''' was a heart patient and love interest of [[Izzie Stevens]]. He died of a stroke following a heart transplant. Later, he appeared to Meredith as a ghost type figure when she nearly drowned and again to Izzie when she had cancer.\n\n\n\nDenny had been a patient of [[Preston Burke]] for a long time. He had been diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy, which caused his heart to fail. He came into the hospital when a transplant became available for him and it's during this hospitalization that he met [[Izzie Stevens]]. The two of them flirted, but she ultimately had to break the news to him that he wasn't getting the heart, so he was discharged and left. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\nHe came back into the hospital later in heart failure. They stabilized him in the ER and then admitted him. He was later tachycardic, but alert. In order to slow his heart rate, they had to shock his heart, which was excruciating for him. After he was stable, he got to know Izzie better. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\nWhile hospitalized, Denny experienced shortness of breath and chest pains. His heart failure was getting worse despite medication. He later had flash pulmonary edema, so he was put on Bi-pap, but Burke said that he needed more. In order to extend the time he could wait for a heart transplant, he wanted to insert an [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]]. When he heard he wouldn't be able to leave the hospital after getting the LVAD, Denny said he needed to think about it. After speaking to Izzie about it, he decided to have the LVAD implanted. ''(\"[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\")''\n\n\nWhile on the LVAD, Denny started experiencing shortness of breath. He had a pulmonary embolism. They tried to use a catheter to clear it, but they couldn't, so they had to open his chest. They were able to relieve the clot and he was stable after surgery. ''(\"[[Superstition]]\")''\n\nDenny then started looking into a portable LVAD, which would allow him to get up and out of bed. Izzie opposed the idea, which caused Denny to be hesitant about it. Despite this, he went ahead with it, but he was having trouble breathing while on it. They had to intubate him, which stabilized him. They thought the tubing in his LVAD had gotten kinked. He was stable and able to get up and walk around after they fixed the problem. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nWhile walking around the hospital with his portable LVAD, Denny collapsed and fell in the hallway after trying to use the stairs. His LVAD battery was nearly dead, so they took him back to his room. He was upset with being confined to the hospital and said he wanted to go home. Izzie tried to get his spirits back up with chocolate and tabloids, but he told her to stop, saying he hated being weak. He said if she knew what it was like, she would have let him die. ''(\"[[Damage Case]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a heart became available for Denny at [[Mercy West Medical Center]], he was prepped for the surgery. He decided before the surgery to sign a DNR, saying that he was done if he didn't get the heart.\n\nWhen the donor flatlined, Burke tried to get the other donor's heart for Denny. In order to help his case, Izzie lied on the phone and said that Denny was getting worse. However, when they asked for labs to confirm, she realized she had to make his heart actually worse in order to fool them. She decided to cut his LVAD wire. Denny tried to stop her, but he relented when she started crying and said that she would never forgive him for making her love him if he died. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\nAfter cutting his LVAD wire, Izzie manually pumped his heart. When she found out Burke had been shot and wasn't coming, George took over pumping and the interns decided that they'd have to get the tests results themselves. Cristina looked at his heart. At this point, Denny woke back up and proposed to Izzie before coding. They used adenosine to stabilize him. At this point, Bailey came looking for them and found out what they were doing. She took over treatment and then consulted with Richard to figure out what they should do about the heart. They submitted the labs and had the heart brought over for transplant as instructed by UNOS. Because Burke had been shot, [[Erica Hahn]] was brought in to perform the transplant. She placed the heart and attempted to get it started. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\nThe heart eventually started to beat and they closed. After surgery, he marveled at having warm hands and a regular heart beat. He was stable in his room, but later that night, he threw a clot off his incision and died of a stroke. ''(\"[[Losing My Religion]]\")''\n\n\nAfter his death, Izzie struggled to figure out what to do with the money he'd left her. She used about $, of it to pay for [[Heather Douglas]] to have surgery. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\nShe then decided to use the rest of the money to fund the free clinic that [[Miranda Bailey]] wanted to open. ''(\"[[Great Expectations]]\")''\n\nEight days later, the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]] opened to the public. ''(\"[[Wishin' and Hopin']]\")''\n\n\nMeredith's Near-Death Experience\nWhen Meredith drowned in [[Elliott Bay]], she woke up in the \"afterlife\" and saw Denny and [[Dylan Young]]. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nDylan and Denny bickered while Meredith wondered what she was doing, with Dylan wanted to tell her straight what was happening and Denny wanting to be more cautious about it. When it seemed that she had accepted her death and wasn't willing to fight to go back, they kept asking her what happened. They eventually got her to admit that she had stopped trying to survive. Denny told her that occasionally, he and Izzie would be in the same place at the same time and he could feel her. This made Meredith decide that she didn't just want moments with Derek, encouraging her to fight to go back. By then, they worried that she might be out of time. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\nIzzie's Hallucinations\nIzzie started seeing Denny while working on the case of the man who was supposed to get the heart she stole for Denny, [[Michael Norris]]. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nShe continued to see him as she worked on [[Clay Bedonie]], who suggested that she might be haunted by him. She had Alex burn the sweater she'd made him, which she kept. Despite this, she continued to see him. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nIzzie continued to see Denny and believed it was just memories, because they'd done the same things when he was alive, so he suggested they do something they hadn't done when he was alive, have sex. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\nBecause she was dating Alex, Izzie started talking to Denny about that and Denny expressed his disgust for seeing her with Alex. When she told Alex that she saw Denny sometimes, he dismissed it, saying it was cool with him because Denny's dead and he has her. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\nIzzie eventually asked Denny to leave, but he continued to stay and appear to her. He frequently said, \"I'm here for you,\" which frustrated her. He told her that she didn't have time to think about anything else. He said he thought that getting to be with her again was heaven, but then he started to think it was hell. Izzie eventually concluded that he was saying that because she was sick. She told him to leave, which he did. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\nAfter she learned that she had cancer, Izzie stopped seeing Denny for a while as she had the brain mets removed. When she saw him again, she knew it meant that she had a new brain met. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\nWhile the doctors fought over Izzie's treatment, she daydreamed about sitting on a beach with Denny. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\n\nHe says that he is funny and really nice. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Izzie lies with Denny.]]\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nDenny's father told [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] she was nothing like the women Denny usually dated.\n\nDenny first met Izzie when he was admitted to Seattle Grace Hospital as a heart transplant patient. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\nWhen he came back to the hospital later, their relationship started to develop more. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\nSoon, she started playing Scrabble with him and spending all her free time in his room, even though she was seeing Alex at the time. ''(\"[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\")''\n\nIzzie took a celibacy vow along with Meredith and Meredith took up knitting. Izzie had to knit pieces of sweater and replace the ones Meredith did because Meredith wasn't good at knitting. Denny was shocked that she'd taken a vow of celibacy because he wondered how he'd be able to get into her pants with her being celibate. In addition to this, she made Denny a sweater of his own, which she then wore for three hours before giving it to him. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\nAfter seeing the way Izzie and Denny reacted when they disagreed over the portable LVAD, Bailey became worried that their relationship was starting to cross a line. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nAfter a rough day for him, during which he fell while trying to use stairs, Izzie came into his room and crawled into bed with him, even after he warned her that she'd get in trouble. ''(\"[[Damage Case]]\")''\n\nWhen a heart became available for Denny, Izzie was told she couldn't prep him for surgery because she'd gotten too attached. However, she convinced Bailey to let her do it, with a warning that she better not get too close. When the heart fell through and she was trying to get the other one, she convinced him to let her cut his LVAD wire to make his heart worse. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\nAfter Izzie cut his LVAD, he lost consciousness for a while. When he came to, he proposed to Izzie. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\nAfter his heart transplant, he confirmed that he wanted to marry her. He wanted something that was his own choice after years of doctors making choices for him. She agreed to marry him. When Denny died, Izzie climbed into his bed and wouldn't leave until Alex told her that Denny's body was not him and picked her up off of him. ''(\"[[Losing My Religion]]\")''\n\nWhen his father came to meet Izzie after Denny's death, he told Izzie that Denny was rich and had written her a check for . million dollars and a voice message to his parents telling them he had met the love of his life. The money he had given to Izzie was used to establish ''[[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]]''.\n\n\nDenny's parents were devastated when he was diagnosed. He'd never been sick a day in his life before his heart failure. One day, Denny left a note for his parents saying he didn't want them to have to watch him die. They assumed he was dead until he left them a voicemail telling them he'd gotten a new heart and was getting married. ''(\"[[What I Am]]\")''\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nDenny was friendly to all the doctors, particularly Izzie, but when Meredith drowned in Elliott Bay, he was extremely kind to her in the ''after-life''. In the after life he could feel Izzie sometimes, if they were in exactly the same spot at exactly the same time. Denny also told Meredith that if she chose to die, she would only get moments with her loved ones. This changed Meredith.\n\n\n*His Zodiac sign was Capricorn.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*He loved to travel and cook.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*Denny died on May ,  at :pm, at the age of .<ref>[[Losing My Religion]], x</ref>\n*After he died, his body was sent to Memphis.<ref>[[Time Has Come Today]], x</ref>\n*Denny was scared of hospitals and could never sleep when he was in one, as he feared he wouldn't wake up.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*He loved animals.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*During a \"Morbidity and Mortality\" conference, he was referred to as patient number .<ref>[[Oh, the Guilt]], x</ref>\n*According to his father, he liked dark-haired, smart girls.<ref>[[What I Am]], x</ref>\n*He claimed that he was smart, but not a know-it-all.<ref>[[Begin the Begin]], x</ref>\n*He made more posthumous appearances than antemortem appearances.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Begin the Begin]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Superstition]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[The Name of the Game]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Damage Case]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[ Seconds]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Losing My Religion]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Rise Up]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[These Ties That Bind]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[In the Midnight Hour]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[All By Myself]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Wish You Were Here]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Stairway to Heaven]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\nDennyDuquette.png|[[Here's to Future Days]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Denny Duquette Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Denny Duquette]]\n[[fr:Denny Duquette]]\n[[es:Denny Duquette, Jr.]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duquette, Denny Jr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

When they saw George cleaning out his locker, they went to check out the cafeteria. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nOn his first day as an intern, he was assigned to [[Alex Karev]], who took them on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thatcher Grey]] came in drunk and kept asking for Dr. Grey, Pierce came to get Alex because he didn't know what do to. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. Karev said that he wanted to dump Pierce because he hated saying the name.\ua''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural as practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Mark broke his penis, the interns watched his surgery and gossiped about how it had happened.

''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. [[Lexie Grey]] ended up winning the contest.\ua''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns worked on Patient X (actually Izzie using her own scans and labs) and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended Alex and Izzie's wedding. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen George died, Pierce attended the funeral. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program.\n\nCristina had Pierce, Megan, and Leo spy on the Chief for her and report back what they saw. Pierce was ultimately cut as part of the first round of layoffs. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nPierce participated in a documentary someone was making about the doctors from the hospital. He was interviewed even though he was only working in the morgue. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] once considered using him to \"scratch an itch\", asking [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] if he was clean, but later decided against it.\n\n[[Megan Nowland]]\nPierce was dating [[Megan Nowland|Megan]] at some point, but they broke up, when she found a nurse's number on him, and then got back together. During their break, Megan slept with [[Steve Mostow|Steve]], and Steve accidentally sent an email to people about their hookup, including Pierce. According to [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]], Pierce wants to kill Steve, but it appears that Steve has punched Pierce, with Pierce having a black eye and Steve having a bloody hand. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nPierce and [[Alex Karev|Alex]] have a mutual dislike for each other. When Alex was trying to decide which intern to give to George, he considered Pierce because he didn't like the name.\n\nLater, after operating on [[Sadie Harris|Sadie]], Alex told the interns he didn't respect them but Pierce noted that he still respected Izzie, even though she killed [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|a patient]].\n\n\nOriginally one of [[Alex Karev|Alex Karev's]] [[Internship|interns]], he was later reassigned to George O'Malley. He was part of the secret intern society.\n\nDuring his second year of [[Resident|residency]], Pierce was part of the first round of lay-offs when [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] merged.\n\nPierce is now working in the morgue at Seattle Grace. But he doesn't appear to be too happy about his new job, referring to it as \" working in the underbelly of Seattle Grace\" and that he hates it. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\n*It is possible that the nurse whose number was found is someone called Samantha, from the OB ward, who is still on good terms with Pierce.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n*He was briefly in a band, formed by Steve, but was kicked out after he made Megan cry, while they were in the midst of a performance.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nIntern.png|[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\nInternPierce.png|[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\nInternPierce.png|[[Forever Young]]\nInternsLauraandPierce.png|[[The Becoming]]\nInterns.png|[[Here Comes the Flood]]\nInterns.png|[[Brave New World]]\nInternPierce.png|[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\nInternPierce.png|[[In the Midnight Hour]]\nInternPierce.png|[[Stairway to Heaven]]\nInternPierce.png|[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\nInterns.png|[[Before and After]]\nInternPierce.png|[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\nInternPierce.png|[[Stand By Me]]\nInternsPierceRyanandMegan.png|[[Elevator Love Letter]]\nInterns.png|[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\nxPierceLeo.png|[[Good Mourning]]\nxLeoPierce.png|[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Pierce Halley Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Pierce Halley]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Halley, Pierce}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Webisode Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She is roommates with [[Levi Schmitt]]. After the shutdown, she got a job as a bartender at [[Emerald City Bar]].\n\n\n\nShe had panic attacks as a child. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")'' When she was young, she used to pretend her stuffed animals were sick and would bandage them up. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nTaryn came into [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for an interview to be considered for an internship. When asked about her faults, she said that she hates all of her peers. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\nTaryn attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\nOn Taryn's first day, a roller coaster derailed at a fair. Taryn and Vik tended to [[Dean Parson]], who was injured while pushing kids out of the way. They noticed free fluid in his abdomen and he was taken to surgery, despite Amelia ordering a CT. When Taryn informed Amelia of this, Amelia brought the CT into the OR to do the scan. They found a bleed in his brain and Amelia did a craniotomy. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\nWhen the hospital was hacked, Taryn and the other doctors had to resort to using old school methods to diagnose and treat patients. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nTaryn came to tell Alex their patient had a bleed, but he sent her to find Jo and stay with her. Taryn did so, even going so far as to follow Jo into the bathroom stall. She was later joined by [[Vikram Roy]] until they were dismissed when Alex and Meredith came to stay with Jo. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\nTaryn helped April treat [[Paul Stadler]] when he was initially in the ER and then later informed April that he had died, though she didn't know the details of the case. She also assisted April in delivering [[Ruby Taylor]]. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith had an idea for a surgical project for the contest while operating, she had Taryn pull out her phone and record Meredith explaining everything she wanted to do for the project. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith needed to convince another surgeon who held the patent for the polymer she needed to allow her to use it for her research, she had to wait for a phone call from Madrid. She had Taryn wait for the call, but when it came, Meredith was busy with a patient, so Taryn took the call, angering Dr. Cerone. When they called back, Taryn was told to hand the phone over to [[Andy Herrera]], who was able to convince Dr. Cerone to meet with Meredith when she was in the US. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\nTaryn informed Meredith later that Dr. Cerone was dead, which is why they were stalling. The patent was left under the control of his daughter, [[Marie Cerone]], also a doctor. They later presented the idea to Marie, who was an old friend of Ellis's. When she was reluctant to allow Meredith use without proof that it would work, they showed her the mouse they had secretly treated using her polymer. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nThey continued to try out other polymers to treat various mice. However, the mice kept dying, threatening their success. They kept working despite those setbacks and found that the mouse who had been injected with the cells without a polymer did the best overall, giving them hope for progress. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\nAfter overhearing Maggie, Amelia, and Meredith planning a game night, Levi showed up with Taryn. Maggie just shut the door in their faces. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. Andrew and Bello were fighting in Spanish and Italian, when Helm joined the arguing in French. April also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\nAfter several of the doctors ingested weed cookies, Meredith told the interns they'd have to step up more and told them to keep track of what they did and whoever did the most would win a contest and get to scrub in with her on a Whipple. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\nTaryn assisted Jackson and Meredith on [[Diego Ramirez]] and his tumor resection. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\nAfter April was in a car accident and came to the hospital hypothermic, Taryn and the other interns took shifts with the attendings doing CPR. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Taryn was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. When Taryn got drunk and said she was going to confess her love to Meredith, Carina stopped her, saying love's too precious to waste it on someone who can't love you back. Despite a series of delays, Jo and Alex eventually got married on the ferry, witnessed by their friends. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\nTaryn spent the night monitoring [[Cece Colvin]]. When she crashed, Taryn helped save her. She then continued to monitor Cece as they tested her heart and when Cece noticed that Taryn has a crush on Meredith, she advised Taryn not to waste her time and offered romantic advice. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\nCece later got an infection that made her dialysis catheter no longer available for use, which forced them to find a new way to get access. Meredith later figured out they could use a translumbar catheter. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith showed up to work dressed for her lunch date, Taryn was in awe of her appearance. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] took a personal day last-minute, Webber told Taryn and Schmitt that they were to report to Andrew and remember to provide patients the best level of care. They helped Andrew treat a man with lacerations and Levi had trouble with a cut on his forehead. Levi struggled, so Andrew gave him a pointer. Later, when [[Molly Graham]] stopped breathing, Andrew had to intubate and brushed off the interns' help, which Richard disapproved of. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\nDuring the windstorm, Taryn was excited about the impaled patients. She helped treat [[Phoebe Moss]] and when Phoebe was declared brain dead, she noticed that Phoebe had the same blood type as [[Cece Colvin]]. She contacted UNOS who said because the organs couldn't be transported anywhere due to the storm, they would approve a directed donation to Cece. However, the power went out right as Cece was being taken into surgery. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nTaryn quickly began to panic in the elevator, which increased Bailey own panic. They worked to calm each other down, but were soon calling out for help to come. Jackson and Link came to their aid, trying to open the doors even as [[Jed Lundberg]] tried to stop them. When he learned the organs were for Cece, Jed instead helped. He helped them get free and Taryn and Bailey rushed the organs to the OR. Taryn then assisted with the transplant, but unfortunately, Cece didn't survive the surgery, which greatly upset Taryn. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on the case of [[Uma Paxton]], who was having several internal organs removed to treat a recurrent vaginal tumor. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\nWhen Catherine had surgery to remove her tumor, Taryn was in the crowd watching from the gallery until Richard closed the gallery. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on the case of [[Lucille Reid]]. She believed Lucille, [[Julian]], and [[Marvin]] were a poly couple and seemed pleased to see them. However, it turned out that while she and Marvin were married, she and Julian were just best friends. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\nDuring the opioid overdose, Taryn worked meeting the ambulances outside and triaging patients. She triaged [[Betty Nelson|Betty]] and [[Linus]] when they came in. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\nWhen Alex's mother came to the hospital to see him, Taryn came to tell Alex she was there, calling her Mrs. Karev. Alex, believing that she was talking about Jo, corrected that it's Doctor and told her to say he would meet her at the party. She relayed the message to Helen, who was confused. ''(\"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\")''\n\nWhen one of the lambs from Vincenzo's lab died, he argued with his children over why it happened and what it meant for the research. Taryn came to get Alex so he could see what had happened. ''(\"[[And Dream of Sheep]]\")''\n\nTaryn helped Jackson treat [[Toby Donnelly]], who had been in a snowmobile accident. ''(\"[[Add It Up]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Abby Redding]] needed surgery after being raped, Taryn was among the women who lined the hallway to the elevator to ensure that Abby wouldn't see any men's faces. ''(\"[[Silent All These Years]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on the case of [[Gus Carter]], a child who had a cough a recurrent sinus infection for over two weeks. Due to autism, he wasn't comfortable with a physical exam, so Alex used his love of building and some legos to get him to tell them he was in a lot of pain in his chest. They found a thymoma, but couldn't operate because he was anemic and needed a transfusion first. Then they found out he has an extremely rare blood type with RH null, meaning he needed an exact match to his type. They had only been able to locate four potential donors in the world, but Alex promised they'd keep looking until they found enough to operate. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\nTaryn stepped into [[Scott Carter|Scott Carter's]] surgery to update Nico on his other patients and also asked if she could scrub in on the broken butt. Nico criticized her for making light of a patient's condition and sent her away. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to find her joy again, Bailey set up a skills lab based around the case of [[Wade Foltz]]. She challenged the residents to determine his diagnosis and then practice their surgical skills for the chance to do a portion of the surgery. Taryn participated in the skills lab and won over the other residents. In surgery, she finished her part of the surgery, but when she removed the second clamp, he started bleeding profusely. Taryn immediately panicked and looked to Bailey, who took a step back and Andrew eventually stepped in to finish the surgery. ''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\nWhen an article came out that condemned the healthcare industry, stemming from a list of possible article topics Meredith floated to a publisher, the residents discussed it in the locker room while getting ready for their days. Taryn liked the article and said Meredith was a badass for writing it, but Blake warned them that while he had Hopkins and Koracick on his resum\ue, they might have difficulty finding other jobs. Later, Taryn worked with Teddy on Alicia Chen, who had been hit by a person who fell out of a plane. ''(\"[[It's Raining Men]]\")''\n\nWhen Zola had to have her shunt revised, Taryn was in on the surgery. To her delight, Meredith gave Taryn her number to get updates. Taryn sent updates throughout the surgery and when they were finished, she came out with Tom to tell Meredith how things went. ''(\"[[Breathe Again]]\")''\n\nOn Halloween, Taryn went to the peds department costume parade to watch the children. When Nico came to see Levi, who was unable to leave due to having to plan the event, she commented on their relationship and costumes. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing, Taryn and the other residents were told they'd have to up their game to make up for the missing attendings. At the end of the day, the residents were all exhausted from the extra work they'd done. Blake then announced that Levi had been the one to turn Meredith's fraud in, turning the other residents against him. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\nOn Meredith's first day back at work, Taryn and the other residents greeted her with a cake. Afterward, they went on rounds, where they worked on the case of [[Elliott Calhoun]]. Taryn scrubbed in on his surgery and asked if she should close. However, due to a complication, they ended up having to leave him open and wait.  ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Taryn was at the bar with some other residents, a car crashed through a window and into the bar. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nTaryn's leg was injured in the accident and she also believed she had a broken pelvis. Jackson determined that her leg was broken and set it after giving her a couple shots of whiskey so she could tolerate the pain. She continued to believe she was dying, despite multiple people assuring her she wasn't dying, that she was just drunk. When they finally got the back entrance unblocked, Taryn was put on a gurney and taken out of the bar. ''(\"[[I Know This Bar]]\")''\n\nAfter being removed from the bar, Taryn was taken to the hospital, where they placed an IVC filter and repaired her leg. While Meredith was placing the filter, Taryn, a little intoxicated, confessed her love for Meredith. As Link and Nico were finishing on her leg, she started coding, so Bailey and Richard stepped in to stop some internal bleeding. They had to extend the initial incision into a sternotomy to get proper visualization to find the bleed. They were able to stop her bleeding and she was expected to make a full recovery. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\nTaryn and the other residents were assigned to look into every possible diagnosis for [[Suzanne Britland]]. They gathered in her hospital room and went over every possible explanation for Suzanne's symptoms. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\nAfter she had recovered from her injuries and returned to work, Taryn worked on [[Scott Burke]], who came in after being attacked by a bear. She was confused when she learned that Scott's wife, Rachel, was in love with another man, but kept it secret from Scott at her request. Scott later died of his injuries. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\nTaryn rounded on Ms. Gutierrez with Richard and some other residents. She was meant to scrub in on her surgery, but after she made an off-putting comment about freezing to death being peaceful, Richard chose [[Tess Anderson|Tess Desmond]] to scrub in instead, not knowing she was actually a patient, not a resident. Taryn later scrubbed in on the surgery when the truth came out. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\nTaryn was impressed when Meredith set up a day for  people to get pro bono surgeries. She helped coordinate the patients, but got into trouble when she moved patients at Andrew's word, without Meredith's authorization, an act which she told Andrew was unforgivable. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on Guthrie Hamilton's surgery. When Amelia believed she was in labor during the surgery and had to step back, Taryn congratulated her. Later, when Tom had a moment of panic when Guthrie coded, she asked if she should go page someone to help. Teddy was able to calm Tom down and he was able to finish the surgery. ''(\"[[Sing It Again]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard returned to Seattle after his disastrous presentation, Taryn along with the other residents were challenged to look for things that could explain his symptoms. ''(\"[[Sing It Again]]\")''\n\nShe continued to work as part of the team finding a diagnosis for Richard. When he was diagnosed with cobalt poisoning, his hip replacement was replaced and he was cured. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\nTaryn helped on the case when [[Erin Banks]], whom the hospital previously knew as Cindy Wright, came back to the hospital. She was a human trafficking victim who had developed a hernia. Taryn was shocked to see Bailey let Andrew work on her case. When they learned the truth about her, including her name, Taryn was the one to call the police and inform them of Erin's location. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\n\nEarly in the pandemic, Taryn had a mild case of COVID-. She said she learned to make sourdough during that time. She couldn't taste or smell it, but the texture seemed right to her. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\nTaryn was back to work at the hospital as COVID- cases started to creep up. When a shipment of PPE arrived, expected to contain masks, Taryn and Mabel were assigned to guard the boxes. They were all disappointed when the shipment contained only booties. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Yvonne Boyd]] was mauled by her pet tiger, she was brought to Grey Sloan Memorial. Taryn did an ultrasound of her heart and pronounced her dead on arrival. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on the case of [[Manoj Joshi]], a sex therapist with a hand injury. She became fascinated when she learned that he advertised as being able to get his clients up to  orgasms in an hour. While they operated on him, Taryn talked about people needing sex especially during a pandemic. After surgery, when Manoj offered his secret, Taryn eagerly asked him to share it. He said he simply asked what his clients wanted and he listened to them. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Tom Koracick]] demanded a second COVID test, believing the first to be a false positive, Taryn delivered it to his house and took it back for testing after he completed his own swab. She was interested in his statistical model, which he wanted to use to stop the pandemic. When she returned to his house a second time, he told her he'd destroyed the world on the model. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\nTwo days later, Tom was brought to the hospital with neurological symptoms. Taryn noted that he'd been fine when she last saw him. When they got him into the ER, Taryn was kicked out of the room as she was a resident and he had COVID, even though she'd already had it and recovered from it. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nWhen Seattle Pres reached capacity and stopped accepting patients, Grey Sloan Memorial activated surge protocol, which meant residents would start seeing COVID patients. Taryn was part of the operation to set up the cafeteria as COVID overflow. When she placed the monitor in the wrong place, Teddy snapped at her and then sent her away when Richard asked for help moving patients. Later, she found Meredith in another patient's room, having tended to them when they coded. As Meredith went back to her own room, she told Taryn to get her a wheelchair and then she collapsed. Taryn sat by her bedside as Richard made the difficult decision to have her put on a ventilator. ''(\"[[No Time for Despair]]\")''\n\nTaryn was in the ER when she saw that Andrew had been stabbed and needed surgery. She went to share this news with Richard Webber. Later, Andrew died of his wounds. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\nIn the wake of Andrew's death, Richard Webber planned a memorial service for him as they would be unable to have a funeral. Taryn recorded Levi speaking about Andrew to add to a video tribute for Carina, but wouldn't let Levi record hers. Taryn felt extremely guilty. She helped treat [[Byron Gibbis]] for endocarditis and as many of the doctors headed toward Andrew's memorial service, she told Maggie that she had benefitted from Andrew being sick as it meant more surgeries for her and that left her feeling guilty. On top of that, she hadn't touched anyone without gloves since before the pandemic started. Maggie had her turn around and they stood back to back, touching through their clothes. Taryn then attended the memorial with the other doctors. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\nOnce Meredith was off the ventilator, she had another CT because she was unable to stay conscious. Taryn was delighted when the scan showed no obvious problems, but Richard was concerned because she was still too weak to wake up. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\nTaryn helped treat [[Guy Houston]], who was injured in the Seattle protests that followed the death of George Floyd. She was shocked at how much damage a rubber bullet could do and learned that a rubber bullet is a metal bullet encased in rubber. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\nAfter some time treating patients during the pandemic, Taryn began to feel burned out and considered leaving her residency. Levi, seeing her struggling, invited her to move in with him, so she wouldn't be alone so much anymore. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\nJo chafed at Taryn's presence and only let her stay because she was a good cook.\n\nAt work, Taryn bonded with a heart patient named [[Gwendolyn Yates]], talking to her about her dating life and work. When Gwendolyn was discharged, Taryn gave her her number and said to call anytime. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nTaryn enjoyed living with Levi, but Jo was annoyed by their constant presence and decided to leave. \n\nMeanwhile, when Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, she cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, Taryn was able to get her first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nTaryn helped treat [[Father Christopher]], who was injured when [[Emma Correa|Emma]] and [[Nadia Correa]] lost control of their tandem bicycle and ran into him. Despite their best efforts, he died of his injuries. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them  seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total,  patients were treated using this method. At the end of the day, Taryn sat outside a bench thinking through her surgery and what went wrong. Bailey told her that was a good thing as it would prevent her from making the same mistake again and that all great surgeons did it. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nLater, Taryn scrubbed in to assist Levi as he operated on [[Devon Gomez]], who was having an ileostomy reversed. When they reached the point of dissection, Levi had an attending paged, but decided to go ahead and start the next part of the surgery, saying it was routine for him by that point. However, Taryn quickly noticed that Devon was bleeding. She and Levi raced to find the source of the bleeding. Once they'd identified it as coming from the base of the IMA at the aorta, they tried to stop it, but they were unable to and by the time Maggie, Richard, and Bailey arrived in the OR, Devon was dead. Taryn explained what had happened and Bailey forced Levi to call time of death, as it was his patient and his mistake. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhile Levi went to the scrub room to scrub out, Taryn explained to Bailey and Richard what had happened. Later, when Jo told her that Levi needed their help, she helped get him to the ER, where Jo and Jordan bandaged his hands, which he had scrubbed until they bled. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nAn M&M was assembled to determine how Devon's death could have been prevented. At the M&M, Taryn weighed in when Levi struggled, filling in details. After the M&M, Taryn was hesitant to treat patients, worried about getting something wrong. Bailey noticed this and acknowledged that Taryn had been through something as well. Taryn explained that as a child, she always knew the right answers, but never raised her hand because she didn't want to be known as a know-it-all and she was getting that same feeling again, even though Levi is her best friend. Bailey reminded her that in that OR, he was her boss in addition to being her best friend. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Levi quit, the other residents were only getting assigned simple procedures, which they considered a form of punishment. When Richard didn't show up for work, they questioned what they were supposed to do. Meredith, who was operating on [[David Hamilton]] that day, went to Hamilton and asked if she could use his surgery as a teaching opportunity and allow all hospital staff to observe. The residents were eager to be part of this. Before the surgery started, Meredith explained what they were doing and gave them time to ask questions. The surgery then proceeded and went well. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Ivan]] came to the hospital entrance with a python wrapped around his body, Bailey sent Taryn to gather the surgeons to come consult on his case. Once she'd gotten them downstairs, she hid inside the hospital doors, because she was afraid of snakes, until Richard sent her to get alcohol to help release the python. She later scrubbed in on Ivan's surgery. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nTaryn was selected from among the residents to scrub in on [[Fernanda Lima]], who had traveled from Boston for a Ross procedure. Taryn told Maggie she was honored to be selected for such a difficult surgery. When they learned that Fernanda's condition had worsened and had to convert to a Ross-Konno procedure, an even more difficult surgery, Taryn was worried about the additional risk, but the surgery went smoothly and Fernanda's family was told she'd be okay. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nWhen Taryn learned that Andy had been assaulted, she brought an evidence collection kit from the hospital so she and Carina could collect the evidence where Andy felt most comfortable. They asked for Andy's consent before starting each step of the exam. Taryn then explained that one vial of blood would go with her back to Grey Sloan for testing while the other went into the kit to be handed over to the police. ''(\"[[When the Party's Over]]\")''\n\n\nTaryn and the other residents were called to do grand rounds with [[Nick Marsh]] and [[Meredith Grey]]. They arrived to find Nick with the patient, Mason Taylor, who was brain dead after being struck by a drunk driver. His wife wanted to donate his organs, but UNOS rejected them, so she donated his body for research. Nick explained that they would be transplanting a genetically modified pig kidney into Mason's body in the hopes that they could perfect the technology, which would eliminate the wait for donor organs. He transplanted the kidney near the groin so they had better blood supply and could see the kidney as they waited to see if it would work. After the surgery, they celebrated that the kidney was producing urine. When the kidney later stopped working, Nick had them do a biopsy and sent the residents away to avoid screaming at them. Then he did everything he could to save the kidney, but started to lose faith. Meredith suggested using epinephrine, which worked and Jordan reported that the kidney was working again. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the Grey Sloan Memorial surgical residency program was put on probation, Taryn worried about the possibility of the program being shut down, which would mean finding a new residency spot. And if they weren't able to find new spots, she worried that they'd have to change specialties. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\nTaryn met [[Simon Clark]] in the ER and presented his case to [[Atticus Lincoln]] and [[Jo Wilson]]. He was a previous patient of Link's, so Link took over his care. Next, she presented the case of [[Margot Talbert]] to [[Maggie Pierce]] and [[Winston Ndugu]]. She had abdominal pain and a pulse in her abdomen. They took her for a CT, which showed an abdominal aortic aneurysm. They took her into surgery, but her aneurysm ruptured before they could start, forcing them to hurry. They were able to repair the damage and she was stable afterward. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\nOn the day [[Jamarah Blake]] was set to return to the hospital to rule on if the program would be allowed to continue, Taryn scrubbed in on [[Cora]], who had a large pancreatic head tumor. Due to the intricacies of the tumor, they decided to do the surgery ex-vivo, removing all of the involved organs, then dissecting out the tumor before replacing the organs. During the surgery, Taryn was responsible for sucking up as much of Cora's blood as possible so that it could be recycled back into her body. The surgery went well until they replaced the organs and began re-attaching them. Taryn noticed some unexpected bleeding and since they had no blood available to transfuse into her, Meredith suggested they stop until more blood arrived. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")'' Taryn went to retrieve the blood, but found that the shipment of blood had been largely destroyed, leaving them with no blood for Cora. This forced them to move Cora to the ICU without completing her surgery. After Cora died, she helped Levi put out the word on social media that they needed blood at the hospital, drawing in several donors. At the end of the day, when the surgical residency program was shut down, she had to pack up her things. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nWith the program shut down, Taryn got a job tending bar at [[Emerald City Bar]]. Six months later, when the program was re-started, Levi came to the bar to beg Taryn to return, but she told him she was making more money as a bartender. ''(\"[[Wasn't Expecting That]]\")''\n\nRichard also tried to get Taryn to come back to work, saying the program needed her, but she still refused. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe has a crush on Meredith Grey. While drunk at Alex and Jo's wedding, she planned to tell Meredith, but\ua[[Carina DeLuca]]\uastopped her, saying love was too precious to be wasted on someone who can't love you back. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\nDespite this advice, Taryn continued to pursue Meredith, who was oblivious to her pursuits. When [[Cece Colvin]] noticed this, she told Taryn that she spent  years falling in love with straight girls and offered to help Taryn not do that. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\nLater, when she was in surgery to place an IVC filter, under the influence of the sedation plus some whiskey, she confessed her to love to Meredith. When she sobered up, she was extremely embarrassed. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\n\n[[Levi Schmitt]]\nShe and Levi are best friends. They lived together at [[Levi and Taryn's Loft]] until he quit his residency and moved back in with his mother. After several weeks, she brought him his mail at his mother's house. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nShe was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] until the residency program was shut down. She found a job bartending, where she said she makes more money with less stress.

Just then, the power came back on as he predicted. Richard complained to him later because of the elevators. While helping others get out of the elevator, it turned back on and crushed his legs.

[[George O'Malley]] helped coach Bailey through her labor, and she thanked him by naming her son William George Bailey Jones (although he is nicknamed \"Tuck\" for his father). ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Tuck was still very young, his mother brought him into the hospital with her. She took him into an OR gallery, where they observed part of [[Jake Burton|Jake Burton's]] surgery. She took him out of the gallery when Jake coded. ''(\"[[Yesterday]]\")''\n\nOnce her maternity leave ended, she had to bring Tuck into the hospital with her because the nursery was full and Tucker was out of town. When she got paged into surgery, she had Cristina babysit him. ''(\"[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\")''\n\nTucker took a year off work so that he could take care of Tuck at home. Miranda always felt bad about not having enough time to spend with him so she started to call them from the hospital, once making a late-night call to sing \"God Bless the Child\" to him. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nOnce, he flooded his house after sticking a toy down the toilet.\n\n\n[[File:BabyTuck.jpg|thumb|left|px|Baby Tuck]]\nOne day, Tuck went to his mother's office in search of her and a bookshelf fell on him. Tuck was rushed to the ER so they could assess his injuries. They ran a full trauma panel and took him for a CT. The CT revealed that his stomach was in his chest and his colon was ruptured. They took him into surgery. When Bailey came into the OR while they were operating, Erica stopped and refused to continue until Bailey left. In order to get her to leave, Cristina agreed to hold Tuck's hand. The surgery was successful, but there was still fluid in his chest, so they didn't know how soon he'd be able to breathe on his own. Desperate to help her son, Bailey invited a faith healer, [[Elizabeth Archer]], to do a healing ritual on Tuck. Afterward, he started breathing on his own and was able to be extubated. ''(\"[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen he was fourteen months old, he punched someone in his day care named Harrison over a graham cracker. Bailey had to bribe the director to keep Tuck there with medical perks for some of the staff and supplying fruit slices. Tucker told her it had happened numerous times before. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the hospital shooting, Tuck went with his mother to see his grandparents for a month. ''(\"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\")''\n\n\nWhile his mom was treating [[Holly Wheeler]], a kidnapping victim, she came to collect Tuck from the hospital daycare to find he was not there. She had been deeply disturbed by the circumstances under which Holly had been abducted from the street by her kidnapper and she jumped to the conclusion that the same had happened to Tuck. It turned out that he had been taken to see a nurse as he had a nose bleed and was reunited with Miranda just after she insisted that another teacher call a 'Code Pink'. ''(\"[[The Girl with No Name]]\")''\n\n\nTuck attended his mother's wedding to [[Ben Warren]]. ''(\"[[Things We Said Today]]\")''\n\n\nTuck told Ben he wanted to be a mad scientist for Halloween, so Ben spent a lot of time helping him create the perfect costume and the two of them decorated the house to look like his lab. ''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\n\nHis mother and Ben took him to an amusement park. He was an inch too short to ride one of the rides, so he tried to scam the ticket taker. He wanted to stuff his shoes with his socks to make himself look taller. He threw a fit when his mom wouldn't let him. ''(\"[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]]\")''\n\n\nTuck was sent home from school after punching a kid in his class. Bailey let him sit in her office, not wanting to bring the hammer down on him after spending all day doing so with her employees. Ben convinced her to tap him in and he used a \"scare straight\" attempt, showing Tuck [[Andrew DeLuca|Andrew's]] scans and lying to say that Andrew was blind in one eye and Alex was in jail for punching him. It was effective and Tuck handed his phone over to his mother for two weeks and promised to apologize to the kid and never do it again. ''(\"[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]]\")''\n\n\nDuring a teacher work day, Tuck and his friend, [[Rocco]], didn't have school, so they came to the hospital. Ben was supposed to sign Tuck up for Science Camp, but he forgot, so Maggie offered to do a science camp with the kids instead. They enjoyed the science she showed them and asked how she did it. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nAfter treating [[Eric Sterling]], Ben and Bailey knew it was time to give Tuck The Talk. They taught him how, as a Black person, to deal with interactions with the police, telling him to be polite and respectful, even when others aren't. They told him his only job was to make it home safe at the end of the day, so he could become everything he wanted to be. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nTuck had a history presentation to give at school, so he got dressed up. He was embarrassed by his mother taking a picture of him on the drive to school because his tie wasn't straight. He later told his mother the presentation went well and he got a standing ovation from all the teachers. ''(\"[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\")''\n\n\nTuck pulled the fire alarm at his school to get Ben there as quickly as possible with no questions. He needed Ben's help because his friend [[Ava Linsley]] was in labor. Tuck then helped Ben and Vic deliver Ava's baby. To keep Tuck from getting in trouble, Ben told him to turn his sweatshirt inside out and cleaned his hands with a wipe so no one would know he had pulled the alarm. ''(\"[[Invisible to Me]]\")''\n\n\nOn Dia De Los Muertos, Tuck decorated a sugar skull and told his mom about the day. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n\nAfter learning that Tuck was \"talking to\" a girl, Ben and Bailey decided they needed to talk to him about dating and consent and condoms. Ben offered to do it as his father had done for him. He took Tuck for burgers and explained to him that consent is necessary and if at any point, anyone he's with isn't having fun, everything stops. ''(\"[[Silent All These Years]]\")''\n\n\nTuck visited Ben at the station and had a meal with him and the rest of the team. When Tuck left abruptly, Ben tried to stop him, but Tuck called him out on not having much time for them lately because of his Medic One training. At the end of the day, while driving Tuck home, he told him the story of what happened with [[Elliot (The Dark Night)|Elliot]] and his daughter. Tuck agreed that it really sucked. Inspired by Elliot, however, Ben decided to spend the night outside with Tuck looking at the stars. ''(\"[[The Dark Night]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Joey Phillips]] was discharged without anywhere to go, Bailey took him to her house, where he played video games with Tuck. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\n\nBen came home after a long shift to find Joey and Tuck playing basketball together. He then joined their game. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n\nTuck and Joey came with Bailey to the spaghetti dinner fundraiser to help raise money for Pruitt's funeral. They ate voraciously, then discussed their mutual desire to go down the fire pole, which Ben said they couldn't do. When they cleared their plates, they asked if they could go get more, which Ben said they could. ''(\"[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\")''\n\n\nAt the start of the Covid- pandemic, Ben's sister Rosalind came to live at her brother's house to watch Tuck and Joey while Ben and Bailey both quarantined due to their work. Both boys enjoyed this change and wanted Rosalind to continue to stay with them. Rosalind brought them down to the hospital one evening to clap for the healthcare workers at the hospital along with the firefighters of station . ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")'' ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Lorelei]] the tiger escaped into Seattle and was eventually trapped in the barn at station , Tuck and Joey FaceTimed Ben so they could see her. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\n\nBen came home one day after living at the station since the start of the pandemic. He said he'd tested negative for the virus, but then told them that Bailey's mother had died. Tuck lashed out at him, saying Ben wasn't his dad, before fleeing to his room and refusing to speak to anyone. Ben drew him out of his room by cooking spaghetti. Tuck apologized and asked him how he and his mom deal with seeing people die so often. Ben explained that while sometimes they could only do damage control, sometimes, they're the answer to someone's prayers. And helping that person can do more than save a life. They can restore someone's faith, which strengthens his own. He then said they'd get through this by showing up for each other. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd, protests cropped around the country, including many in Seattle. Joey and Tuck asked Ben if they could join the protests, saying they wanted to march for themselves and for Rosalind. Ben finally agreed and they marched along the rest of Station . ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station )|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n\nTuck attended the party Ben and Bailey threw at the station for Pru. ''(\"[[Crawl Out Through the Fallout]]\")''\n\n\n\nHis parents tried to conceive for ten years unsuccessfully when his mother was surprised to find she was pregnant.\n\nHis parents then divorced when he was three. By a few years later, his parents had both remarried.

She had to be rushed into emergency surgery. Molly was devastated and didn't want to call her husband because she didn't know if their baby would even live.

One of the hospitals his route serviced was [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], which is how he and April met.\n\n\n\n[[File:MatthewAndApril.png|thumb|left|px|Matthew assisting April.]]\nMatthew noticed April and tried to make contact. She didn't really pay attention to him, because she was too busy with teaching [[Stephanie Edwards]] how to run the [[Emergency Room|ER]]. He tried to impress her by giving her medical information about her patient without her having to ask for it, but she didn't seem to notice his effort.\n\nLater, he tried to ask April out, but he was rambling so much that April, yet again, didn't seem to notice that he was interested in having a date with her. ''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:MatthewAndApril.png|thumb|left|px|Matthew helping April with the hit and run victim.]]\nAfter the ER had closed down, there were no more trauma patients at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital|Seattle Grace Mercy West]]. Therefore, both Matthew and [[April Kepner|April]] had some free time, so they ate burritos in the ambulance. Matthew found out he had to respond to a hit and run victim. He asked April to come along on the ride.\n\nApril couldn't resist helping him, and Matthew decided to help her. She called Jackson, informing him that they were about to bring in a trauma patient. Jackson informed several other attendings, and together they broke open the ER doors. They had to treat the patient in secret, as the hospital wasn't a trauma center anymore. Matthew and [[Paramedic Nicole Cummins|Nicole]] assisted April, Jackson, and other doctors to give the boy primary first aid care.\n\n[[File:MatthewAndApril.png|thumb|right|px|Matthew and April kissing for the first time.]]After having saved the hit and run victim, April left the hospital and she bumped into Matthew. He revealed that he had been waiting for her and that he made up a speech. However, he got too nervous when she stood in front of him, so he made up a whole new speech. He told her that he thought she was incredible, because she managed to save the boy, and fearless, because she knew she wasn't allowed to bring the kid to the hospital, but she did. He wasn't finished yet when April, totally charmed by Matthew and his shyness, bent over and kissed him. As they were sharing their first kiss, Jackson and Stephanie Edwards walked by. Jackson saw them, realizing that April had totally moved on from him. ''(\"[[The Face of Change]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:MatthewAndApril.png|thumb|left|px|Matthew asking April out on a real date.]]\n\nAfter getting to know each other better, April and Matthew shared several short dates in his ambulances, consisting of talking and kissing. At some point, Matthew revealed that he wanted more than the short dates. He shyly asked her out. However, April was charmed by his shyness and said yes.\n\nThe date ended up in his apartment. They were kissing on his couch when he interrupted their kiss, saying \"this is only going so far tonight\". He then revealed to April he was still a virgin, saving himself for marriage. April was relieved, as she was worried about how he'd react when she would tell him that she was saving herself for marriage too. She told him exactly the same thing and almost told him about her sexual encounters with Jackson. However, she didn't tell him to not scare him off and they continued kissing. ''(\"[[Hard Bargain]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Matthew's injuries.]]\n\nWhen her patient was brought from the ER to the OR, April noticed Matthew laying in an ER bed. She walked over to him, looking worried, and asked him what happened. His colleague [[Paramedic Nicole Cummins|Nicole]] answered instead and told April Matthew broke protocol and ran in the crash to shield the kid from the blast with his own body. April started to check out his wounds, but Matthew told her to go to her patient, as she was more important than him. When Jackson said he'd watch him, April told him not to go into shock or bleed out before she went to the ER.\n\nApril walked by Matthew's room some time later, but Jackson was busy with smearing burn ointment on the burns on Matthew's butt. April felt a bit uncomfortable and left.\n\nThe next day, April talked to Matthew about her patient, who died during surgery. April started talking about God tearing apart her patient and her husband, who were meant to be together, when Matthew assured her he wasn't going anywhere. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Matthew was staying in the hospital, he planned for his mother to pick him up from the hospital. That way, she would meet April for the first time. However, April decided to come clean about her virginity. He was mad at her, not for the fact that she wasn't a virgin anymore, but because she hadn't been honest about it. Soon after, they broke up. ''(\"[[She's Killing Me]]\")''\n\nSoon after, Matthew came to the ER to ask April for a second chance. He said he broke up with her because he was hurt and that he acted like an idiot. April gratefully forgave him and they got back together. ''(\"[[Sleeping Monster]]\")''\n\n\nSome days later, Matthew proposed to April in a very original way. He set up a flashmob for her, in which friends and colleagues danced together with him. Almost everybody at the hospital knew about it, except for April herself. Owen Hunt helped Matthew by actively keeping April from surgery (which she was very mad about), so she surely would be there when the flashmob started.\n\nAn ER nurse came to look for April, saying a patient was coming into the ER. April said to Jackson, with whom she was talking then, she'd probably get kicked off that case too. While April went outside, everyone else who was free at the time gathered to go outside as well. [[Paramedic Nicole Cummins|Paramedic Nicole]] informed April that the \"patient\" felt like his heart was going to burst. When the music started, the \"patient\" started making noises, making April think he was having a seizure. Suddenly, while April was asking why there was music playing, Nicole and the other paramedic started rotating the stretcher. The man then came off of it, and he and the paramedics started dancing. Suddenly, other people came out of and from behind other ambulances and Nicole put April on an office chair. While all the people started dancing, all the staff that gathered came outside. Matthew then came running down the stairs and danced along with the others. While two dancers lifted up April, Matthew got a rolling table with a rose on it, which he gave to April as soon as she sat down again. He then told her how he fell in love with her and Nicole gave him a ring. Matthew then proposed and April said yes. The dancers then threw rose petals while the spectators, including Jackson, applauded. ''(\"[[Readiness is All]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the super storm, Matthew came into the hospital to see how he could help. When he saw how April reacted to believing that Jackson had died, he became suspicious of their relationship and figured out that Jackson was the one April had had sex with. ''(\"[[Perfect Storm]]\")''\n\nApril later found Matthew and assured him she wanted to marry him, even proposing to him herself. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n\n\nThey attended pre-marital counseling together with [[Reverend Drew]], where they were tested for compatibility and found to be % compatible. However, Matthew worried there was one area where they weren't compatible. April thought it was their different income levels, but Matthew really meant that she'd had sex before and he hadn't. He suggested they just have sex to get it over with, but she said she didn't want to be the cause of him breaking his promise to God. They agreed to wait. ''(\"[[Two Against One]]\")''\n\n\nAfter meeting up in a coffee shop where April and Matthew were having brunch with her sisters, who were in town for the wedding, they left the caf\ue at the same time, just in time to see [[Leo Davis]] get dragged by a cab. They both immediately jumped into action. While Jackson was distracted trying to control the crowd, Matthew used a straw to perform an emergency tracheotomy. They both rode to the hospital with Leo, where Jackson critiqued his technique, saying he made the incision too low and wide and horizontally instead of vertically. Matthew defended the way he did it as Jackson took Leo for surgery.\n\nApril later confronted Jackson about the way he'd treated Matthew, which made her sisters think he was a nitwit. Jackson told her Matthew did a good job and he'd have done it the same way. When April told Matthew this, he went to Jackson for an apology, but Jackson said that he really did screw it up. Matthew said he was just trying to save Leo's life and tries to clear the air with Jackson, saying he hoped he'd see him at the wedding. ''(\"[[Man on the Moon]]\")''\n\n\nDuring Matthew and April's wedding ceremony, [[Reverend Drew]] spoke to the wedding guests, asking them if they would support the marriage of Matthew and April. Everyone said, \"I will\" except Jackson Avery, who was at the wedding with his girlfriend, [[Stephanie Edwards]]. Shortly after, Jackson stood up in the middle of the ceremony as if he was about to say something, but hesitantly sat back down after receiving many surprised looks from guests and the wedding party. The ceremony resumed, but Jackson stood up again and confessed that he was still in love with April. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")'' Jackson and April then ran from the barn where the ceremony was taking place, and went to his car where they then drove away. ''(\"[[Take It Back]]\")''\n\n\nMatthew came to the hospital when his wife, [[Karin Taylor|Karin]] went into labor with their child. After the baby was born, he stayed with her, but returned to Karin when she had pain after her delivery. She was taken into surgery, where they had to remove her uterus due to DIC and HELLP syndrome. She survived the surgery, but shortly afterward, she went into PEA and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nMatthew brought Ruby back to the hospital when she had trouble eating and was vomiting. Arizona examined her and suspected it had something to do with her heart, but before she could run more tests, Matthew admitted that he was uncomfortable with her as Ruby's doctor, so she handed Ruby off to Owen. Owen examined her, but April went to him with a suspicion that it wasn't her heart and was actually something intestinal instead. Ruby was diagnosed with pyloric stenosis, which was easily corrected with surgery. While Ruby was in surgery, Matthew went to the chapel, where April came and sat with him. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\nWhile driving with April, she warned him about a curve up ahead, but he hit it anyway and the car overturned. April was able to get out of the car and call . They took Matthew to the hospital, where he revealed that April was with him just as he was sedated. He had bleeding in his upper left quadrant, so he was taken for a splenectomy. The surgery went well and afterward, he was awake and taken to April's room, where they held hands from their respective hospital beds. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\") ''\n\n\nMatthew attended Alex and Jo's wedding with April. After the wedding ended up cancelled because of a series of catastrophes, Matthew proposed to April again and when the officiant finally arrived at the wedding site, they decided to get married immediately, with Sofia as their flower girl. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the [[COVID- Pandemic]], his sister in Philadelphia got sick, so he took Ruby there to take care of her. However, his relationship with April was extremely tense by that point, so he and Ruby stayed in Philadelphia even after she was well again. April said he was still so angry about Karin's death and April leaving him at the altar and it got to be too much for both of them, so they started working longer hours to avoid each other until he eventually left. ''(\"[[Look Up Child]]\")''\n\n\nMatthew is sensitive and shy. He also saved himself for marriage. According to April, he respects women and has good values.\n\n\n\n[[April Kepner]]\n[[File:MatthewAndApril.png|thumb|px|Matthew tries to ask April out.]]\n\nBringing a patient into the ER at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], Matthew worked together with April Kepner in the ER. ''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\")''\n\nAfter some time, they started having short ambulance dates, and Matthew than revealed that he wanted a real date. April happily said yes, although she was concerned about how he would react to her wanting to keep from having sex again until she was married. She asked Jackson for advice, and he told her to let him get to know her first, and then tell it. However, it turned out April had nothing to worry about. The date ended up in his apartment, they started kissing on the couch. Matthew then stopted kissing, and told her that he was saving himself for marriage. He was afraid April would run from him, but she was relieved and told him she was doing exactly the same. ''(\"[[Hard Bargain]]\")''\n\nWhen one of April's patients, [[Elyse Cruse|a woman]] who seemed destined to be with her husband, died, April started thinking about her own relationship - although the implication is that she was really talking about Jackson, with whom she had earlier almost shared a kiss. Matthew misconstrued this to mean she was worried he'd leave her, so he reassured her, saying he wasn't going anywhere, and confessing that he was in love with her. April, stunned, did not respond, instead taking his hand. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\nWhile he was hospitalized with burns, Matthew planned for April to meet his mother, who was coming to pick him up when he was released. However, before they could meet, April confessed that she'd lied about being a virgin and he ended things with her, because she had lied. ''(\"[[She's Killing Me]]\")''\n\nMatthew later came into the ER, asking April for another chance and saying that he reacted brashly. She forgave him and they got back together. ''(\"[[Sleeping Monster]]\")''\n\nWhen Matthew decided to propose, he planned an elaborate flashmob proposal with the help of other paramedics, nurses, and doctors. She accepted his proposal immediately. ''(\"[[Readiness is All]]\")''\n\nDuring the Super Storm, Matthew saw the way April reacted to thinking Jackson had died and figured out that Jackson was the person April had had sex with. ''(\"[[Perfect Storm]]\")''\n\nAfter the storm ended, Matthew asked April if she'd only accepted his proposal because he did it publicly. She later took him to the hospital chapel and then proposed to him privately, to assure him it's what she really wanted. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n\nThey attended pre-marital counseling together with [[Reverend Drew]], where they were tested for compatibility and found to be % compatible. However, Matthew worried there was one area where they weren't compatible. April thought it was their different income levels, but Matthew really meant that she'd had sex before and he hadn't. He suggested they just have sex to get it over with, but she said she didn't want to be the cause of him breaking his promise to God. They agreed to wait. ''(\"[[Two Against One]]\")''\n\nOn their wedding day, April and Matthew avoided seeing each other, despite him working and her being at the hospital.\n\nAt the wedding, the ceremony started as normal, but abruptly ended when Jackson stood up and confessed his love for April. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\nApril left with Jackson, leaving Matthew at the altar. ''(\"[[Take It Back]]\")''\n\nLater, after his wife died, he and April started seeing each other again and had fallen back in love. They said it was different before because they'd been through so much and they knew each other's pain. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n[[Karin Taylor]]\nAfter April left him, he met Karin. Because of what had happened to him, he would only be friends with her initially, but he eventually knew she was the one for him. They got married and remained married until her death on the day their first child was born. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nMatthew has a very close relationship with his mother. He wanted her to meet April, but April confessed him she wasn't a virgin anymore. This caused him to be mad at her, and his mother thereby never got to meet April. ''(\"[[She's Killing Me]]\")''\n\nHis first child was born the day his wife died. They named her Ruby. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\nHis mother watches Ruby while he works.

She returned to her job at the library. When Alex noticed she'd stopped cashing the checks he sent, he went to visit her, worried something had happened. She told him about what had happened and after some resentment, he told her he was happy for her. He introduced her to Jo and they invited her to the wedding, but she said though she'd love to come, she couldn't deviate from her routine.

Jo found her waiting in the hospital waiting room and took her to Catherine's party, where she was headed. Alex worried when he saw her, believing that she'd had a break from reality. When she started smelling smoke at the party when no one else could, he believed it was the break finally showing, but when it turned out there actually was smoke in the apartment, he finally started to relax and be excited to see his mother. After the building was evacuated, Alex introduced Helen to Meredith.

When Alex refused to explore other, more radical options, she fired him from her case.\n\nAfter firing Alex, she went to Callie and Maggie directly, asking them for other choices.

''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting outside an on-call room trying to get some sleep, Dani, Steve, and Ryan heard a loud, painful moan when Mark broke his penis. Later, while they watched his surgery, they gossiped about who might have broken it. Sadie eventually confessed, despite it actually being Lexie. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns worked on Patient X (actually Izzie using her own scans and labs) and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up.

As this was in the midst of the [[COVID- Pandemic]], Robert's diner was closed to patrons and instead he bagged up lunches for the community each day and his employee, Tate, delivered them. Since Jackson was there and wanted to talk, he enlisted Jackson's help, having him help put sandwiches together. Jackson also asked his father why he left as he'd realized it messed him up and made it hard for him to maintain good relationships.

Gus was able to use LEGOs to show Alex that he had significant pain in his chest. They ran a chest CT, which showed a thymoma, which Maggie noted is always malignant in children, but curable with surgery. However, before they could operate, he needed a blood transfusion as he was anemic. They got him blood, but he rejected it because it wasn't the right type. They re-typed his blood and showed AB, but with no Rh antigen, a very rare occurrence. Before he could have surgery, they needed to find blood donors who were an exact match to his blood so he wouldn't reject it. They identified only four potential donors, but Alex promised his parents they'd keep looking until they found the blood he needed. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\nA blood donor was finally found for Gus, but she was located in London and had severe agoraphobia. She was flown to the United States with her therapist, but when there was an issue with his visa, they were separated. When Lori found out about this, she knocked over one of Gus's LEGO towers in frustration, scattering the bricks across the floor. Scott went to clean them up, but slipped and fell, breaking his coccyx. He was taken into surgery. While he was there, Gus had a heart attack because of the lack of blood in his body and his organs started to fail, so he was taken to the hyperbaric chamber in order to buy him enough time to wait for the transfusion. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nIn the hyperbaric chamber, Gus was able to get more oxygen to his organs. However, he still coded, so they started decompressing the chamber as Frances was still on her way to the hospital with Owen. Alex did chest compressions and refused to stop until the blood had been transfused, at which point, he went back into sinus rhythm and regained consciousness.

She spent four months waiting for a heart transplant before one came through. The transplant was successful and Ivy began to recover. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-op, Ivy's indices were good and she was recovering well. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLater, Ivy spiked a fever. Cristina took her to the OR for a biopsy, which revealed that she was rejecting her donor heart. They treated it with anti-rejection medication and put Ivy back on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nIvy was later discharged to recover at home. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Ivy was in surgery getting her new heart, [[Jon McNeil]] brought their second child, Frankie, into the ER because she was coughing up pink fluid. She, too, was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. The doctors inserted a pacemaker. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks after her pacemaker was inserted, Frankie was doing well, even walking around the hospital. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nWhile playing Hide and Seek with [[Braden Morris]], Frankie collapsed in a hallway. When she was found, her pulse was weak and she wasn't breathing well. She was taken into surgery to insert an LVAD and then she was put on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nFrankie's LVAD failed to reverse the heart damage, which left her in desperate need of a heart. One became available, but when they transplanted it, they discovered that it had been damaged during retrieval and couldn't keep her alive. When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting in Frankie\us room while the doctors talked to his parents, Link started to cough up pink fluid just as Frankie had. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nLink was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and declined quickly. They attempted to put him on a Berlin Heart, but he was clotting too much. They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLink's heart pump worked well, keeping him stable as he waited for a heart transplant. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nLink was later discharged and allowed to wait for a heart transplant at home. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\nA heart became available for Link during the aftermath of the explosion at the Mall of the Woods. Despite this, they had Link come in to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for his transplant. The transplant was successful. ''(\"[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Link's heart transplant, [[Maggie Pierce]], who was looking into genetic causes of cardiomyopathy for another patient, discovered what had caused the McNeil kids' cardiomyopathy. A mutation called RAF  had been discovered to cause cardiomyopathy only a week before and all three McNeil children had that mutation. Sabine was relieved that it wasn't something in their house or something she had done. ''(\"[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Jon McNeil]]\nSabine is married to Jon McNeil, with whom she has three children. When the stress of their three kids being in the hospital started to get to them, they fought, Jon walked out, and Sabine wondered if it would destroy their marriage. However, Jon came back, saying that he had fallen asleep in the car and his phone had died. He apologized and they made up.\n\n\nSabine has three kids, who have all been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy.\n\n\n[[Teresa Morris]]\nWhile their kids were hospitalized, Sabine and Teresa bonded over questioning whether or not to trust the doctors to save their children.\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nBoth Sabine and Jon grew to know and trust Cristina Yang while their children were hospitalized. When Cristina disappeared after losing the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], they were discontent with having [[Jeff Russell]] do Frankie's heart transplant.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxSabineMcNeil.png|[[You Be Illin']]\nxSabineMcNeil.png|[[I'm Winning]]\nxSabineMcNeil.png|[[Go It Alone]]\nxSabineMcNeil.png|[[Change of Heart]]\nxSabineMcNeil.png|[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\nxSabineMcNeil.png|[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\nxSabineMcNeil.png|[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Sabine McNeil Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McNeil, Sabine}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Genetics)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

However, her lack of enthusiasm caused Arizona to end their relationship in the airport and leave without her. ''(\"[[That's Me Trying]]\")''\n\nA heartbroken Callie moved in with Mark and they had a short fling. ''(\"[[Something's Gotta Give]]\")'' Arizona returned for Callie, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness. ''(\"[[Adrift and at Peace]]\")''\n\nCallie initially rebuffed her and later revealed that she was pregnant with Mark's baby. ''(\"[[Start Me Up]]\")'' Arizona agreed to raise the child with her, but disliked that Mark would be a permanent part of their lives. ''(\"[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]]\")''\n\nWhen Callie was twenty-three and a half weeks pregnant, she planned a getaway-weekend to thank Arizona for her support.\n\nEn route, Arizona proposed to her, but before Callie could respond, they crashed into a truck. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\n\nSofia was delivered by C-section during Callie's second surgery following the crash. [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], Callie's very good friend, returned from Los Angeles to deliver the baby after [[Lucy Fields]] admitted that the care Callie needed was beyond her abilities.\n\nSofia was delivered  weeks early without a heartbeat, weighing just  pound and  ounce. Arizona was able to resuscitate her and she was placed in an incubator as her lungs and other internal organs hadn't fully matured. She was then taken to the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]] and was on a ventilator, as she was unable to breathe on her own. ''(\"[[Song Beneath the Song]]\")''\n[[File:Baby_sofia_new.jpg|thumb|Sofia at one week old]]\n\nAt one week old, Sofia was able to move her hand around and opened her eyes for the first time. She had a brain bleed, but it was minor.\n\n[[File:Baby_sofia_.jpg|thumb|left|Callie holding Sofia.]] \nAt  weeks old, Sofia was in heart failure and required surgery to close her PDA, which [[Robert Stark|Dr. Stark]] performed. He allowed Arizona to be in the OR as she is not biologically related to Sofia and it was not a legal issue for the hospital. During the surgery, Sofia started to bleed out which caused a devastated Arizona to run out of the OR. However, Dr. Stark was able to find the bleeder and repair it and Sofia was stable.\n\nTwelve weeks after the accident, Callie was discharged from the hospital, but reluctant to leave[[File:Baby_sofia_.jpg|thumb|Sofia, Callie, and Arizona going home for the first time after her birth.]] unless Sofia could leave with her. Stark eased Callie's tension by saying Sofia could be discharged if she passed the infant carrier test. She passed, but Callie was scared to take her home because of the dangers of cars. [[Miranda Bailey]] calmed her down and Callie, Mark, Arizona, and Sofia left the hospital. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nWhile playing at a friend's house, Sofia tripped and her head hit a rock, cutting her. Her friend's mom, [[Tori]], brought her to the ER, where [[Penelope Blake|Penny]] stitched up her head. After she was discharged, she and Callie agreed that only ice cream could make her head better and they invited Penny to come along. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Callie wanted to move to New York with Penny and wanted to take Sofia with her, Arizona sued for custody. During the hearing, Sofia stayed with [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] at [[Meredith's House]]. When the trial concluded with Arizona being awarded full custody, they went home together at the end of the day. ''(\"[[Mama Tried]]\")''\n\nDespite this ruling, Arizona agreed to new terms after Sofia kept asking her why Callie was so sad. She gave Callie plane tickets to New York for Callie and Sofia and said she wanted Sofia for the summer and every other school year, plus every other Christmas, but they could work out the details. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\n\nArizona helped her settle in at Callie and Penny's new place, where Sofia has her own room. The place is right near the park and Sofia loved her new school. ''(\"[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]]\")''\n\nHowever, several months later, she sent Arizona a text saying that she wanted to move back to Seattle. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she moved back to Seattle, Sofia told Arizona that she wanted her room to be green, but Arizona couldn't decide which shade, so she told Sofia she could decide herself and they'd paint it together. She also surprised Sofia with three different flavors of ice cream. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her return to Seattle, Sofia refused to go to school. She said she wanted to go back to New York with her friends and the teacher who let them draw on their notebooks. Instead of making her go to school, Arizona took Sofia to work with her, where Sofia met [[Noah Brosniak]], the son of a patient, and the two played together while Arizona examined Noah's mom.\n\nNoah was diagnosed with a brain tumor and when Arizona tucked Sofia in that night, she cried because she realized she was so lucky to have a healthy, smart girl and she was sometimes too busy to understand that. She suggested that she take the next day off and take Sofia to find an adventure. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\nAfter this incident, Sofia continued to refuse to go to school. Arizona had to bribe her in order to get her to go to school. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\n\nSofia was suspended from school for stealing the field trip money from her class. Arizona took her to work and put her in the day care for the day. Then she learned from reading Sofia's diary that she stole the money to buy a plane ticket to New York and didn't want to tell Arizona because she worried about hurting her feelings. That led Arizona to make the decision that Sofia needed to move back to New York and Arizona needed to go with her. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")''\n\n\nSofia was asked to be a flower girl at [[Jo and Alex's Wedding]] alongside her friend Zola. She came to the wedding with Arizona. When the wedding was delayed and then cancelled, Sofia asked Arizona if they'd miss their flight. Arizona assured her they wouldn't and were just staying to help April make sure everything got cleaned up. They then witnessed Matthew proposing to April and them getting married. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe has three parents: Callie, Arizona, and Mark. Her father died when she was still very young, leaving her to be raised by her mothers.\n\nWhen Callie was planning to move to New York with Penny, Arizona fought Callie for custody. Arizona won, but she ended up making a shared schedule with Callie, saying that Sofia deserved two happy moms.\n\nAfter some time living in New York, Sofia decided she wanted to move back to Seattle and so she came back to live with Arizona. When Sofia was in Seattle, she constantly missed New York, leading to Arizona's decision to move to New York so Sofia could have both her moms in the same place and not be constantly missing one of them.  \n\n\nShe and [[Zola Grey Shepherd]] are friends. When Zola was gone after Derek died, Sofia asked when she'd be coming back and insisted on getting her a Christmas present. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")'' They frequently had play dates together when they were little and have been seen playing together on multiple occassions and at family events such as birthdays and weddings.\n\nShe also has a friend named Kayla.

She was worried, so Jackson said that the two of them were a team, so they'd be together through the whole process.\n\nA few months after that, she had facial reanimation surgery.\n\nWhen April and Jackson got married, she looked at their wedding album while at the hospital after yet another surgery and said that April was a beautiful bride and that she wanted the chance to be a beautiful bride someday.\n\nA year and a half into her treatment, she became discouraged and wanted to quit. However, Jackson was able to convince her to continue.\n\nDuring her treatment, she had two paramedian forehead flaps become necrotic.\n\nAfter her final surgery, a nasal septum reconstruction, she was finally pleased with the result.\n\n\n\nShe married a man named Timothy. They had a fight the morning of their wedding, but Jackson said they'd probably have the same fights for  years and not to let a little thing become a big thing. Jackson then walked her down the aisle at her wedding.\n\n\nWhile Jackson was her doctor, the two grew close, to the point where after all her surgeries were completed, he walked her down the aisle at her wedding.

When Jake was told that, he pointed out the rash on Marion's wrist, which she was scratching. [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] examined Marion's arm and saw that there was a worm under her skin. She believed Jake had the same worm in his body. They contracted the worm when they ate sushi from a train station while in Thailand.\n\nThey planned to extract Marion's worm from her arm, but they didn't know where Jake's was, so he was put on anti-parasitics to kill it. However, his legs then went numb and he was unable to move them, indicating that the worm was in his spine.

Shane was admitted to the hospital's psych ward after he freaked out about being pregnant because they believed it was all in his head, but a few of the surgical interns stole him and began investigating the actual cause of his large abdomen. They could feel a solid mass in his abdomen, indicating that it wasn't a hysterical male pregnancy. After running tests, the doctors diagnosed a mesenteric teratoma, a potentially malignant mass. The case drew extensive attention, with doctors paying money for spots in the room. The attention made the Hermans nervous. Meredith eventually stepped in and forced everyone to leave the room and give the Hermans their privacy. Shane was taken into surgery to remove the mass.

However, she did not approve of Cristina (partly because when she first met her, she was stripping to please Preston) and thought she was very selfish when Preston was very selfless. ''(\"[[I Am a Tree]]\")''\n\n\nJane came to Seattle in order to help plan her son's wedding. She quickly bonded with Cristina's mother, [[Helen Rubenstein]], as they planned the wedding together. Under pressure from them, Cristina went dress shopping and chose bridesmaids. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nBurke later confronted her about the way she treated Cristina. He said he knew that she believed he was making a mistake, but he told her he was not. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nOn the day of the wedding, Jane gave Cristina a choker that five generations of Burke's family had worn on their wedding days. She also removed Cristina's eyebrows and drew on new ones. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\nShe came back to Seattle to help plan her son's wedding and finally accepted Cristina when she saw that she was trying hard to put up with the wedding planning.\n\n\nFollowing Preston leaving her at the altar, she came back to Seattle again to collect Burke's remaining possessions from his apartment. However, Cristina avoided her all day and attempted to get her friends and those close to them to see her, but Jane's insightful ability quickly made them think about themselves and then leave promptly, but with some good advice, to [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], and [[George O'Malley|George]].\n\nWhen Cristina finally mustered up the courage to see her, Jane acknowledged that she did love Preston, although she loved being a surgeon more than Preston, and for Preston to leave her, as her lover, and more importantly, her teacher, she was sorry. Cristina also asked her if she could take the wedding presents, which Jane obliged, and left Cristina with the idea that they are not so different, and that if Jane had been born a generation later, she possibly would have become a woman like Cristina. ''(\"[[Love/Addiction]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Donald Burke]]\nJane is married to [[Donald Burke]] and they have one son, [[Preston Burke]].\n\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\nJane thinks very highly of her son. When he was hospitalized, she and her husband came to Seattle to visit him. She says that Preston is very gifted and brilliant and the most important thing in the world to her. She also claimed there's not a woman in the world who wouldn't want to marry him. ''(\"[[I Am a Tree]]\")''\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nShe did not think very highly of Cristina. She was upset when she heard Cristina called Bailey \"The Nazi\" and believed she was extremely selfish by asked Burke to get out of bed to act as a buffer when Cristina and Jane had lunch together.

And, when it's hurt, when the human brain is traumatized, well, that's when it gets even more mysterious.|'''Callie Torres'''}}\n\n'''Callie Torres''' is the former [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic surgery]] and board member at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She was married to [[George O'Malley]], but divorced after he cheated on her. She currently resides in New York with ex-wife [[Arizona Robbins]], with whom she has a daughter, [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]].\n\n\n\nCallie grew up in southern Florida. She was one of two daughters in a wealthy family, a fact she doesn't like to share with significant others. She has stated that \"four years of high school, four years of college, four years of medical school\" makes doctors socially inept at times. She has described herself as \"a total freak,\" and \"I'm that girl in the back of the class who eats her hair.\" She had also admitted to Arizona Robbins that she was in the Peace Corps in Botswana, and that is what had convinced her to go to medical school.\n\nCallie attended her high school prom by herself because she didn't want to wait for \"a stupid boy\" to ask her out. She picked out the sexiest dress, which was red. She made a fashionably late entrance and began to dance. She especially liked the part of prom where everybody else's dates tried to hit on her.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\n\nCallie met George when she reduced his dislocated shoulder. While having a short conversation, George told her he was single. Later that night, Callie ran into George outside the hospital and wrote her phone number on his hand, clearly showing interest in him.<ref>[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, George said that he called a few times but hung up every time. During their short conversation, George admitted that she made him a little nervous, which she thought was good. She then invited him to assist her on a cool ortho case. Before the surgery on the patient, she told him the ball was in his court as that was the last invitation she was giving him.<ref>[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, George didn't call her, so Callie started to ignore him. He realized the same that he should've called her, so while she was working in the ER and he was standing in the same room, he did call her. He said he should've called sooner and asked her out.<ref>[[Superstition]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after, Callie got to know George's friends. Callie came over to Burke's apartment (as George temporarily lived there) and she, George, Burke and Cristina played a game in teams. In the hospital, Izzie and Meredith assisted her on an ortho case. Izzie asked her a lot of questions, and Callie confessed she saw more in George than they did. George also discovered Callie lived in the hospital basement. There, she cut his hair, as he tried to do it himself earlier but totally messed it up, and they shared their first kiss.<ref>[[The Name of the Game]], x</ref>\n\nThe two also had sex for the first time. They decided to spend the next night at Meredith's. Izzie did not welcome Callie and was upset that George had brought her to their house.<ref>[[Blues for Sister Someone]], x</ref>\n\nAfter having spent the night at Meredith's, Callie went to the bathroom naked while Izzie and Meredith were there. She left without having washed her hands in the bathroom, leading to Izzie and Meredith making mean comments about her. However, unbeknownst to them and George, she did wash her hands downstairs in the kitchen. George later asked her if she did wash her hands, which angered Callie because she thought he chose Izzie's side. In the basement, Callie told George she washed her hands in the kitchen and not in the bathroom because Izzie and Meredith were staring at her in the bathroom, which made her feel uncomfortable. She said George had to stand up for her, and George apologized.<ref>[[Damage Case]], x</ref>\n[[File:xGeorgeandCallie.jpg|thumb|xpx|George and Callie kiss]]\nLater, in Joe's bar, it was clear Cristina, Meredith, and especially Izzie still didn't like Callie. When George came over to them, they greeted him exuberantly, while they only greeted her shortly. The following day, Meredith was on Callie's service and seemed to like her a little more. She asked Callie if she could ask something about bone cancer in her dog, but Callie turned her down. George later told her that he got why she asked her, as Doc really meant a lot to Meredith. Callie was surprised George defended her as Meredith really hurt him, but George said it was normal for him to forgive her as they were family, and he suggested Callie did the same. So she paged Meredith to a room to show her scans of a human with bone cancer, and explained some more to her about the disease. Meredith honestly thanked Callie for that. Later that day, Callie told George that she loved him, when suddenly Izzie came in, saying she really needed George's help. George left with Izzie, saying he'd call Callie.<ref>[[ Seconds]], x</ref>\n\nCallie later asked George what happened, but he didn't want to tell her. Therefore, she said no when he asked her to go to the prom with him. Later that day, when he saw her in a dress, he was surprised because he thought she wasn't going to the prom, but she said that she didn't want to go with him, because he avoided her after she said that she loved him. Callie wanted him to say that he loved her to prove that he wasn't avoiding her, but George said if he told her that, it was only because she wanted him to, and not because he really meant it. They kissed to make up.\n\nA nurse asked Callie to go find Meredith because there was something going on with Izzie. She walked in on Meredith and Derek, who just had sex. Callie was in the room where the other interns discovered that Izzie was lying in bed with a deceased Denny.<ref>[[Losing My Religion]], x</ref>\n\nThe day after the prom, Callie came over to Meredith's house with food, because she was worrying about Izzie. When Meredith let her in, Callie assured her that she wouldn't say anything about Meredith having sex with Derek, saying she wasn't that kind of person. Because of that, Meredith opened up to Callie about things that she doesn't tell everyone. While Callie was cooking, Meredith told her that she had no idea what to say to Izzie, who was lying on the bathroom floor. When Meredith left the kitchen because Finn Dandridge, Meredith's boyfriend came to visit, Callie told him that doctors are just socially retarded. She said that she was in love with a guy and cooking in his kitchen, hoping for him to come home and notice her. They ate together, but Callie left when Meredith came back, so that Finn and Meredith could have a conversation. When George finally came home that night, Callie hugged him and told him that she really, really loved him.<ref>[[Time Has Come Today]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:xCallieCaught.png|px|thumb|left|Callie is caught in her underwear by Richard ]]\nWhen Addison hung Meredith's panties, which she found in Derek's pocket, up on the bulletin board, Callie came to the rescue and claimed them, apologizing for leaving her underwear lying around again. George was later asking how it was possible that her panties were up on the bulletin board, and he questioned if it really were hers, as he had never seen them before. When Meredith came to tell her that she would tell the truth to George about the panties, Callie told her not to because she liked the fact that he was jealous. In the ER, Alex asked Callie how her relationship with George could've happened. Before having given a proper answer, Bailey interfered, saying that she outranked him, as she was a resident. Later that day, while she was dancing in her underwear, Richard discovered that she had been living in the hospital basement. He stayed there to talk with her over a cup of coffee, but he had to throw her out, as living in the hospital was against the rules. While they were talking, George came in, saying that he was jealous and didn't want other guys to touch her panties. He then noticed that the Chief was there, and left awkwardly. Callie then put her pants on, packed all her stuff, and said to George, who had been lying on a bench in front of the hospital ever since he left the hospital, that they weren't her panties. She also told him that the jealousy was insanely hot. George then noticed her suitcase and asked her to move in with him at Meredith's.<ref>[[I Am a Tree]], x</ref>\n\nAfter more than a week, George wanted Meredith to kick Callie out, because she was using all of his stuff. When she asked for a key, George said it wasn't necessary because he liked leaving the hospital together. During an argument over a patient's surgery, George said that everything went to fast and that he wasn't ready for her to move in. She then moved out and checked into a luxurious hotel.<ref>[[Sometimes a Fantasy]], x</ref>\n\nCallie was mad at him for saying to Meredith and Izzie how he felt, and not to her. He said that he missed her, which charmed Callie. When they crossed each other in the hospital, she invited him to come over to her hotel room and have dinner there. However, in the evening, George told her that he had to go home because there was something going on with Izzie. She then questioned his feelings for her, and it turned that he didn't even know what he was feeling himself. Callie then told him not to even bother trying to figure it out, and broke up with him. She went to Joe's bar and met Mark Sloan. Mark asked what she'd heard about him, and she replied that most things involved the words \"dirty\" and \"bad\". Callie then left the bar to go to her hotel, and asked him to come with her.<ref>[[What I Am]], x</ref>\n\nThe morning after, George tried to call Callie. She was still lying in bed with Mark and didn't answer her phone. That day at work, Callie avoided George. She confessed to Meredith that she slept with another guy, and Meredith told her that she broke up with Finn, asking whether she should tell Derek or not. That night, George came over to her hotel room with DVDs and fried chicken. She didn't let him in, saying that she broke up with him, even though he hadn't noticed that she did.<ref>[[Oh, the Guilt]], x</ref>\n\nAfter that, Callie started to ignore him. He did continue to talk to her though, even though she initially didn't answer. While metaphorically saying that he was ready to commit to her, Callie walked away because he metaphorically called her a pig. However, when Mark proposed to cheer her up again, she declined, and later went to apologize to George for being rude to him. She said not to chase after her anymore, unless he was ready to catch her.<ref>[[Let the Angels Commit]], x</ref>\n\nAt the hospital, Addison and Callie were sitting in a hospital lounge together, when Mark came in, creating an awkward silence. Addison and Callie worked together on a case that day, starting off their friendship. Their patient was a pregnant woman whose baby died in the womb, which really saddened Addison. Callie consoled her, and they became even closer when they both confessed having slept with Mark and regretting it. Addison asked to go and have a drink together, but Callie got paged. Later that evening, Callie had to tell George that his father was in the hospital.<ref>[[Where the Boys Are]], x</ref>\n\nWhile George's brothers were visiting George's father in the hospital, Callie was in there telling them about how she first met George. She stayed in the room to talk with George's brothers, but George asked her to have a little chat. He told her that she shouldn't talk to his family as she broke up with him. While watching a surgery, Bailey, Addison and Callie had a conversation about motherhood. Callie said she wanted a dozen of them and she'd use a nanny to raise them, as she wasn't willing to give up the scalpel. During the conversation, Callie realized she wasn't ready to move on. She went to George's father's room, where George was trying to explain [[Harold O'Malley|Harold's]] medical condition to his brothers. They didn't understand the doctor talk, and Callie came in and explained it to them in car terms.<ref>[[Staring at the Sun]], x</ref>\n\nCallie kept asking George how his father was doing. George didn't understand why she'd care about his father, as they broke up. Callie said that she still cared about him, but George walked away, sarcastically saying that that was the reason why she slept with Mark. Callie then thought that Meredith told George about this and went looking for her to kick her ass. However, Meredith said that Callie only told her that she slept with someone, and that she didn't know it was Sloan until George told him. Callie said that George thought that she cheated on him, but that he didn't know that she slept with Sloan while they were broken up. She then left the intern locker room to go look for George to tell him that. She found him in the staircase. She told him that she slept with Mark while they were broken up and that she'd never betray him, but George said that he didn't have time for this.<ref>[[From a Whisper to a Scream]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Harold O'Malley was telling George to hide his magazines, Callie came to Harold's room to check the healing of his collarbone. George quickly left when she entered the room. Callie stayed in his room and they had a nice conversation. George later entered the room again, and Callie told him she'd go. Harold told his son that he didn't recognize him, as he was constantly picking fights and asked him why he was so mad at Dr. Torres. They both wanted to go, but George's father told them to stay. Callie then listened to Harold's speech on how angry George had become. At the end of the day, Callie once again asked George how his father was doing, and George replied friendly, seeming to have let go of his anger towards Callie.<ref>[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhile his father was in surgery, Callie calmed down George. She wanted him to confess that he was scared, and tried to stare him down like Bailey taught her, and which previously worked on Dr. Shepherd. George said that he was only scared of her because of the staring. After George's dad came out of surgery, Callie went to his room to ask how he was doing. In there, George was staring at his dad's bag with pee. His family members thought he was acting even weirder than usual, but George said to Callie that there was  cc of pee in  hours, which indicated that his kidney function was good, and they both started cheering and dancing together. While dancing, George kissed her and thanked her.<ref>[[Six Days, Part ]], x</ref>\n\nA day later during lunch time, Callie told Addison that George kissed her. Addison wasn't paying attention, and when Callie made a comment on that, Addison told her that she aborted Mark's baby  months ago. She said she told Mark, who marked the due date on the calendar, and the due date was that day. Addison confessed to her that she felt like she ended up alone. While performing a major surgery, Callie noticed that both George and Meredith left after having been paged, and she realized something was wrong with George's dad. She left the OR. She went to a conference room where Bailey was explaining to the O'Malleys that she had to do a complicated procedure on Harold. Callie was looking through the window, but George nodded to make her come in. Bailey told them that they needed to prepare themselves in case the procedure failed. Later that day, Callie looked at Mark, who then realized that Addison told her about the abortion. He asked her if he'd be a terrible father. After some questions about family, Callie said that to some men, family is the most important thing in their life. Mark then asked her if she knew a guy like that, and she said she did, clearly talking about George. At the end of the day, George's father died.<ref>[[Six Days, Part ]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the death of his father, Callie had sex with George constantly, which was getting a little too much for her. When Izzie knocked on his door with muffins, Callie opened the door and left the room. \"This is not grieving, this is my legs being bent in ways my legs do not bend,\" she said. She put Izzie on \"Georgewatch\"  and left Meredith's house. At the hospital, Cristina worked together with Callie. When Callie told her about George's appetite, Cristina said she shouldn't talk to her about it as they weren't friends. Callie said she thought Cristina would be at least a bit concerned. When George walked into her with Izzie, Callie urged Izzie to do something and quickly left. While scrubbing in for a surgery on their patient, Cristina called Callie's work on their patient impressive. They then talked about how they both hadn't talked for a long time with their partners. At the end of the day, George came to Callie's hotel room to have sex again, but Callie told him she couldn't have sex anymore. George then told her how he had been feeling since his father's death. He then told her that watching her made him feel better, so that they didn't have to have sex as watching her from across the room was fine too. He then kneeled in front of her and proposed.<ref>[[Great Expectations]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Callie accepted the proposal, the two got married in Vegas. They went to the clinic, where Richard, Mark, Bailey, Cristina, Alex and Izzie were waiting on the first patients to arrive, to tell them about it. \"We got married in Vegas!\" George yelled. Everyone was surprised, except for Alex. He started laughing and called her Callie O'Malley. A bit later, Izzie asked George if he was really happy, but Callie heard the question and assured her that they were. George told her to show Izzie the ring. When she did, Izzie said that tiny diamonds are great as no one would ever try to steal it. Everyone at the clinic heard this, but Bailey then put everyone to work, and she congratulated the newly weds. The same day, Callie noticed that Addison seemed to be interested in Alex. After Callie asking this, Addison said she didn't as he was an intern. Callie then told Addison that she married an intern. At first, Addison asked her why they got married so fast, but then just congratulated and hugged her. Addison then told her her ring was beautiful, which made Callie happy. Later that day, George asked her what her middle name was. Callie didn't tell him as she thought he let his judgy friends get to him. When George fell ill due to a patient with toxic blood, he admitted that he thought he fell ill because of the anxiety he got from their marriage. This deeply hurt Callie, as he basically told her their marriage was as poisonous as the toxic patient. She later went to check on him and told him her middle name was Iphigenia, saying she couldn't wait to hear what his judgy friends had to say about that. At the end of the day, Callie came to intern's locker room to go home with George together. Izzie then asked her what her plans were. \"You're not moving in, are you?\" she said. Callie wanted to leave, but George made her stay and told to Izzie, Cristina and Meredith that they were his friends and that if they wanted to drive her off, they'd drive him off with her. \"Calliope Iphigenia Torres is my wife,\" he said. Izzie then smiled and opened her mouth, but George told her to not do it.<ref>[[Wishin' and Hopin']], x</ref>\n\nAt the hospital, Callie told Bailey that it was weird being married to someone she was the boss of. She then said that at work, she was giving the orders at work, but in the bedroom, he was. Before she could properly finish that sentence, Bailey told Callie not to tell her about her sex life. At the clinic, Callie overheard Bailey and [[Sydney Heron]] talking about the Chief Resident position. Callie also helped out while Bailey was teaching her interns the process of triage. While doing so, George took a picture of her. She then took him apart to tell him not to undermine her authority, especially not in front of the interns. At the clinic, Callie wanted to help out Sydney, who was told by the Chief to bring every minor patient from the ER to the clinic to treat them there. However, Sydney didn't want her to take over. Callie then told her she'd go to the OR to scrub in on a trauma surgery while Sydney was stuck in the clinic with minor injuries. She went to the ER, where she stood outside with Addison, the Chief and Yang, waiting for the first patient to arrive. She later refused to help George when he asked her to, as she had to go scrub in on a surgery.<ref>[[Walk on Water]], x</ref>\n\nDuring her surgery on a child, George came in to ask her if her patient was the kid he was looking for. When she took a look at the photo he showed, she recognized him as her patient, saying she'd recognize that goofy ears anywhere. Before he left the OR, he said he couldn't kiss her because she had scrubbed in, but he was about to tell what he'd do that night to her. Everyone in the OR started chuckling, so Callie told him to shut up as she was working.<ref>[[Drowning on Dry Land]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Bailey was working on Meredith, she put Callie in charge of her interns. George and Izzie were waiting in the hallway until they got news about Meredith, but Callie told them to come with her to the clinic as they could help out there. Izzie initially didn't come, saying she needed to stay. Callie told her to come once again, which she reluctantly did. At the clinic, Izzie was getting blood ready for Meredith. Callie said Meredith was strong, and Izzie reacted harshly on whatever Callie said. Callie then asked if she was doing something specific to piss her off or if it was just stress related. Izzie said that it was because  Callie was acting like she knew Meredith, though according to her, only she, Cristina and George really knew Meredith. Callie said she did know Meredith as she was George's wife. Izzie said that that didn't mean anything, that it was just a piece of paper. Callie then told her she needed to accept her, as George choose to have her around. She said that if she didn't accept her and let George choose between them, Izzie would lose another friend.<ref>[[Some Kind of Miracle]], x</ref>\n\nWhile having breakfast together in the hotel room, George was whining about how Izzie was so compassionate with her patients and not with her friends, but Callie suggested not to talk about it. At the hospital, George came to Callie to ask her about the room service bill. She said she sometimes payed more for it, and George suggested to split the room service bill like they split the rest, but she told him not to worry about it. He asked how much she payed for the food, and she said  bucks. She then revealed to him that her parents have a lot of money and that they gave her  hundred bucks a week. Callie explained that she didn't tell him about it because the money had affected every relationship she'd had. George then walked away madly because he felt like he payed her  dollars a week for nothing. During a surgery, Izzie made reference to Callie being rich. That night, Callie was mad at George for telling Izzie. He said he only told Meredith and that he was disappointed that she didn't even give him the benefit of the doubt to believe him. She once again blamed him for choosing his friends over her. He then said he hadn't talked to Izzie, whom he called his best friend, in weeks while she had been lying about her background and her family. During the argument, Callie said that Izzie dissed their marriage every chance she got because she had feelings for him and wanted him. This surprised him. \"She's a supermodel, and I'm George,\" he said. This hurt Callie. \"So what does that make me?\" she asked. She then told him to get out of the hotel room.<ref>[[Scars and Souvenirs]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day at work, Callie urged George to pretend like they were a perfect couple because her dad was in town. Izzie then came in, but she left. Seeing her reaction, Callie realized George had told her about their fight. Before she left too, she told George to get in the shower as he smelled. Callie requested another intern besides George, as he still smelled even after showering twice. Bailey picked Izzie, who tried to get away to the clinic with Cristina as she felt awkward because she slept with George the previous night. During lunch with Callie's father at Joe's, Callie assured her father that George wasn't anything like the other guys she had dated. Callie's father noted that George didn't have any money and that thereby the house and the car he'd get his daughter would be on her name. While Callie and her father were arguing about her relationship (her father was disappointed that everything went so fast without he and his wife even knowing she was seeing someone), George remembered the sex he had with Izzie. He then said he wouldn't let them pay for anything and left Joe's bar. Later that day at the hospital, Carlos Torres said he respected that George wanted to care for Callie, but he warned him not to hurt her. Before leaving for the airport, Carlos made Callie agree to let her mother plan a wedding party. Callie then kissed George, saying she was proud because he stood up to her father. She apologized for last night. She then told George to find Izzie and prepare their patient for surgery. That night in their hotel room, Callie told George, who was clearly thinking about Izzie, that she could smell his clothes through the closet doors. He apologized twice, the second time being more for cheating on her with Izzie. However, Callie didn't notice this and continued reading.<ref>[[My Favorite Mistake]], x</ref>\n\nCallie had a rough night being on call, so George suggested to have a coffee date, to which she happily agreed. While looking for George in the clinic to have the coffee date, Meredith told her that he was with Izzie. When he left an elevator, he saw Callie standing there, and he realized he had forgetten their coffee date. He apologized, saying he had been busy in the clinic with patients. Callie knew that he was lying as she had been in the clinic to look for him, but she just went home and decided not to tell him that she knew he was lying.<ref>[[Time After Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhile studying for her intern exam, Cristina wanted to get Callie's study cards really badly. She tried to befriend Callie by asking her to taste the different wedding cake samples, however, Callie was on to her and just said she wasn't getting her cards. Later that day, Callie told Addison about George's lie. At first, Addison agreed with her that it was probably nothing. When Callie said she needed to stop thinking about Izzie, Addison told her that when she's obsessing about something like that, there's generally a reason. Callie also watched George feeding Izzie part of his lunch while laughing together. Callie later told Cristina she'd give her cards to George, but Cristina said he'd only share them with Izzie. Callie then decided to let her have the cards instead of giving them to George and told her where they were. At the end of the day, she asked Izzie to stop being so close to George and give her her husband back.<ref>[[Desire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Burke's and Cristina's mothers came to Seattle to help plan the wedding, Cristina told them she and Callie were friends. They then urged her to ask Callie to be her bridesmaid. Without Callie even agreeing, Cristina's mother started measuring Callie's sizes for a dress. Later that day, Callie told Cristina a couple of things she'd definitely not wear, and Cristina commented to Izzie that this was a right attitude, opposed to Izzie, who was all excited about the wedding. Izzie then found out that Callie was a bridesmaid too, which she obviously didn't like. Later that day, Cristina, Meredith, Izzie and Callie went shopping for dresses. At work, Callie asked if Izzie if it wasn't too weird she was a bridesmaid too, but Izzie said it was fine. Izzie also told her that she thought George's plan to transfer to Mercy West was a good idea. Callie then asked her if they were fine, and Izzie assured her they were.<ref>[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]], x and [[The Other Side of This Life, Part |Part ]], x</ref>\n\nThe day of the intern exam, while asking him medical questions, Callie found out that George got accepted into Mercy West. Callie was excited about this, saying he now could actually tell her about his day as she wouldn't know what happened if they'd work at different hospitals. When Izzie wanted to call George down after Bailey told him how stupid it was to leave the hospital, Callie saw them and she became suspicious again. While Addison was telling Callie about her unfulfilled wish to have a child, Callie confessed she was thinking about having a baby too. In surgery, Callie revealed she used to mountaineer while in high school. In one day, Callie did four osteosynthesis, amputated two hands and she stabilized a spine in two hours, all in three surgeries happening at the same time. When Mark complimented her about this, he said Bailey wasn't the only one having a shot at getting the Chief Resident job. Bailey, who overheard him saying that, was surprised, as she didn't know that Callie was in running for Chief Resident too, and thereby didn't think that she had competition. Callie told her that she was very good at her job. \"We all know you're the Chief's favorite, but that doesn't mean I can't take a shot,\" Callie told her. That night at Meredith's, Cristina was writing her vows, in company of her three bridesmaids. Everyone but Izzie agreed that the vows didn't really matter anymore after the wedding day. Izzie told them that they took love for granted, while she didn't have anyone and couldn't be with the person she loved. She added she could only think about having the man she loved promise her to love, honor and cherish her. Callie and Meredith both realized she was talking about George. \"You're talking about Denny, right?\" Meredith asked, trying to make Callie forget what Izzie said. \"Yeah,\" Izzie answered, obviously lying.<ref>[[Testing --]], x</ref>\n\nThe evening before the wedding, Cristina and her bridesmaids had fun with dresses made out of toilet paper, while Callie helped Cristina writing her vows. The day of the wedding, Callie told George she could only think about having a baby, even though she didn't really want to house a human being inside of her for  months. George left to take care of a patient, but he later told her they could do it if that's what she really wanted. While Izzie was looking for George in the wedding chapel, Callie told her he'd be late as it was a big day for them too. She told her she was named Chief Resident and that they decided to have a baby. This clearly surprised Izzie. Callie later witnessed how Meredith convinced Cristina to walk down the aisle and how Meredith told everyone that the wedding was over. When everybody left, Callie watched how Izzie was sitting on one of the benches.<ref>[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, George asked her to talk later that day, as she didn't come home the previous night because she was swamped with paper work. While she was looking for a disappeared baby, Mark asked her if she was okay. She said she wasn't because she blew the task the Chief gave her, and she suddenly said that she was thinking that George was having an affair. \"If that's true, he's an idiot,\" Mark said. He then advised her to talk to him about it, as an alternative for destroying her career. That night, George came over to talk. Callie knew what he was about to say, and begged him not to say it as she was exhausted. \"Not tonight. I'm your wife. Do this for me,\" she said. George then agreed and walked away.<ref>[[Love/Addiction]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:Chief resident.gif|thumb|xpx|Callie is announced as Chief Resident.]]\nOn her first day as Chief Resident, Callie didn't exactly know what to do when a big trauma was about to come in. She asked the Chief about this, who just said she had to make sure her residents take care of the trauma. He then asked where the residents that she assigned to the ER were. She said she paged them, and told Bailey that she paged them but that they didn't come. \"When I page them, they come running,\" Bailey said, jealous of Callie. The Chief told her to get it together and left. At work, by saying she might be pregnant, Callie tried to cheer up George, who was a bit depressed because he was still an intern while the others passed their intern exams. Alex asked Torres to be let off their case, but she didn't allow that. Behind her back, Alex went to ask Dr. Bailey, but she told him to ask Dr. Torres as she was in charge. Callie overheard him asking and sent him back to the ER. She then said to be Bailey that she had no idea how she got them to listen to her and have respect for her, which made Izzie smile. At some point that day, Callie's patient was being operated on by Alex and Bailey without Callie even knowing about it. When she found out, she went to the OR to ask for an explanation, but Bailey defended Alex by saying that his quick thinking saved the patient. In the evening, Callie was sitting outside when Bailey came over. \"You wanna humiliate me some more? Cause I get it, I suck, I suck at my job, I suck as a wife, I suck all around, so... Go ahead, humiliate me some more, please,\" Callie said. \"Hope tomorrow is better,\" Bailey said, and she walked away.<ref>[[A Change is Gonna Come]], x</ref>\n\nWhen victims of a massive explosion come into the ER, Callie was tested as Chief Resident again. The Chief takes the first patient and tells her to triage the rest. All other residents are taken, so Callie has to work with Izzie, to whom George said that he loved her the previous night. When Bailey asked her to send residents to the clinic to oversee the interns there, Callie told her working at the clinic is voluntary and that she, therefore wouldn't send a resident, but that Bailey was free to take as many interns as she wanted. Her patient, who was asking Mark about his love life, suggested Mark start a relationship with Callie, but she said she was happily married. Callie found out that George was alone with his patient when the patient coded, and George told her that Meredith (his resident) was in the clinic. It turned out that Bailey undermined Callie's authority and sent Meredith to the clinic, even though Callie told her to only take interns. While she was in surgery, Richard came in, blaming her for not delegating well, as one of her residents got attacked and a baby went missing. Izzie told her that she found that Callie was doing a good job as Chief Resident, despite it being difficult. This enervated Callie, who thought Izzie was mocking her, and she sent Izzie out of the OR. That night, the Chief told her he couldn't spend time with his wife because she let a baby disappear from the hospital, making her feel even more miserable.<ref>[[Love/Addiction]], x</ref>\n\nThe day after, Callie was busy with the administrative side of her job in a lounge at the hospital. Bailey kept coming in to inform her what the residents and interns were doing, but Callie wasn't interested. When Bailey asked her if she was going to come out to do her job, Callie asked why she should as Bailey was clearly doing it so much better. She told her she was doing paperwork because she had no more fight in her. Bailey left without any more comments. In the evening, she came back to tell Callie that was struggling with the fact that she was now number two, while she was used to being number one. She then told Callie she'd be the best number two of the hospital and that she'd help Callie, so they'd act like a team. At night, when George came back to the hotel room, she told him just to say it as she clearly knew what he wanted to tell her. He then confessed he slept with Izzie.<ref>[[Let the Truth Sting]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he told her, she kept sitting silently on her bed in the hotel room until it was morning. When he tried to get her to talk, she told him she forgives him, as he made a mistake, but they also took vows. At work, Callie asked Izzie to talk in the cafeteria at noon about what George told her. Izzie thought they were going to fight, a rumor which quickly spread across the hospital. Callie worked together with Bailey that day, who noticed that Callie was thrown off by something. When Callie entered the cafeteria, everyone expected them to fight and while Izzie was getting ready to fight, everyone came to stand around them. \"I wanted to talk,\" Callie says. Izzie was surprised, as she really thought Callie was going to kick her ass. Callie then left without talking, humiliated by Izzie and everyone standing in the cafeteria. Her patient that day had weak bones because her husband urged her to lose weight. When the patient died, Callie went to talk to the patient's husband. She related too much to her personal life and started yelling that he didn't really love his wife, as he pushed her so hard to be skinnier and that you don't destroy the person that you love. George took the man inside, while Bailey asked Callie one more time if she was all right. \"It's nothing,\" Callie said. \"Good. Cause nothing almost cost you your career,\" Bailey says. Izzie later came to apologize for the incident in the cafeteria and for having slept with George. Callie told her she should be humiliated and ashamed and that she shouldn't ask her for forgiveness. George also came to her, saying that she shouldn't forgive him. He told her he knew she said she forgave him because she wanted to pretend it never happened, while she actually didn't forgive him. She said he was right, that she didn't forgive him, and walked away.<ref>[[The Heart of the Matter]], x</ref>\n\nIn the morning of Halloween, Callie and Miranda told the residents what they had to do that day. When Izzie asked a question at Callie, Callie told her to redirect her questions to Bailey. Cristina asked if they all had to redirect their questions to Bailey, but Callie told her it was just for Dr. Stevens. When Bailey asked her why Izzie had to redirect her questions, Callie revealed to everyone that Izzie slept with George. Callie worked together with Mark, and he told her he heard about her marriage. He told her he was available all day and night (in particular) to cheer her up. She confessed that after the wedding in a church and the vows, she couldn't believe her life had become like this. In surgery, when Norman Shales commented that people do strange things, Callie said that she had world's shortest marriage. Cristina told her she was literally left in the church, wearing a wedding dress. They laughed together about their marriage problems. At the end of the day, Callie moved in with Cristina in Burke's apartment, but she was not allowed to clean.<ref>[[Haunt You Every Day]], x</ref>\n\nIn Burke's apartment, Callie slept on the couch. Despite her efforts to assign him to Mark to keep him away from her, Callie ended up working with George when their patients refused to let go off a wedding dress because of a contest. When Callie told Mark she tried to keep him away from her, Mark told her he'd torture George to make her feel better. He did this by having George act as a proxy when both future brides were convinced to let go off the dress, so George had to carry the dress while the women were being treated for their injuries. Callie told Mark it cheered her up indeed. When her patient woke up after surgery and she asked about the wedding dress first, Callie told her that she should fight for a marriage, and not for a wedding, as a marriage could also be a lost cause. She told her patient she needed to learn to let go. After Mark and George's patient came out of surgery, Callie talked to George. He was glad she was talking to him, and she told him she was letting go.<ref>[[Kung Fu Fighting]], x</ref>\n\nRichard tells Callie she needs to be a better Chief Resident, but she has back-to-back surgeries so she asks Bailey to take over for her and act as Chief Resident that day. When Cristina, who had been told by Bailey to try other specialties (Bailey pretended it had been Callie's idea), asked to be on Callie's service, Callie was surprised as she didn't know what Cristina was talking about. However, she quickly got that it had been Bailey's idea and let Cristina scrub in. In surgery, Bailey came in to ask her to solve scheduling problems. Callie told her to solve it herself. The Chief found out about that Bailey was the one acting as Chief Resident, and he fired Callie to give the job to Bailey. Callie went home, where she told Cristina she was fired.<ref>[[Physical Attraction... Chemical Reaction]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day at work, Callie congratulated Bailey with her new job. [[Sydney Heron]] came over to congratulate Bailey as well, while she said she felt sorry for Callie, who assured her she was fine with it. Callie had lunch with Cristina, who kept ranting about Hahn. Callie didn't listen to her, as she kept looking at George and Izzie, who started a relationship. Cristina noticed this and told Callie they weren't worth to get hung up over, as they apparently weren't even talking to each other. Callie commented that that made her feel better. When Callie saw how hard Cristina was trying to impress Hahn, Callie told her she was now only annoying Erica and that she should back off. Callie told her patient that she was fired from Chief Resident, and that it was a good, as she could now get back to the part that she liked: surgery.<ref>[[Forever Young]], x</ref>\n\nCallie had to work together with Izzie. When Hahn asked her if she could steal Izzie from her service, Callie said she could have Izzie for free.<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Mark commented in surgery that Hahn was as mean to herself as she was to others, Callie defended Hahn by making him stop talking. After their surgeries, Hahn asked Callie and Mark if they wanted to have a drink with her. They agreed, although Hahn urged Mark not to hit on her.<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Erica held the elevator for Callie and greeted her by saying \"Dr. Torres\". Callie told Erica that anyone who can outdrink her and then still kick her butt at darts gets to call her Callie. They agreed that last night was fun, and they both commented that they were not a group person because they generally don't like people. As the elevator opened and Mark greeted them, Erica and Callie started laughing. \"Case in point,\" Erica said as she and Callie walked away. Later that day, Callie met [[Louise O'Malley]], whose calls were never returned by George or Callie. Louise, who didn't know that her son and Callie broke up, showed Callie the baby clothes she knitted, as George told her that he and Callie were trying to get pregnant. She took the clothes and went to George to yell at him for not telling his mother that he cheated on her. \"She's waiting in the lobby,\" Callie told George as she handed over the clothes. When Callie met Louise again, she knew because Izzie told her. Louise is concerned that God would punish George for cheating on her. Callie told Louise that she doubted God was present at their Vegas wedding, and she said that even though George wasn't the one for her, she loved being an O'Malley for the little while it lasted. At the end of the day, Callie and Erica went out together.<ref>[[Lay Your Hands on Me]], x</ref>\n\nShe and Erica went out dancing, and it got late, so they went straight to the hospital together. Cristina then discovered that Callie and Erica were friends. Callie also worked together with Izzie in a professional way. Cristina wanted Callie to put in a good word for her with Erica, but Callie says she and Erica don't talk about Cristina. At the end of the day, Callie and Erica hung out at Cristina's apartment.<ref>[[Where the Wild Things Are]], x</ref>\n\nTheir friendship grew closer and they did sunrise yoga together, which they both found to be intense. Callie told Erica about Addison, and Erica agreed with her that Addison was nice. Erica informed Addison that Callie got divorced, and Callie completed Erica's sentence by saying it was the best thing that could've happened. They gave each other a look and started laughing, which Addison noticed. At noon, Callie and Addison met outside to have lunch together. While Callie was walking up to Addison, Cristina approached and told Callie that Erica was no longer welcome in her apartment. Callie came to Erica's defense, naming some of Erica's qualities. Addison overheard what she said, and when Callie sat down, Addison asked her if she and Erica were a couple, because it seemed like they were. Callie tried to laugh it away, and said she was a huge fan of penis. Callie later went to the cafeteria where she asked Cristina and Meredith if people ever thought that they were a couple. \"No, because we screw boys like whores on tequila,\" Meredith said. \"And then we either try to marry them or drown ourselves,\" Cristina added. Cristina then told Callie that she had to make Erica let her scrub in on a surgery, and if not, she would make her move out of her apartment. Callie managed to do this by promising Erica to buy drinks at Joe that night. Addison, Erica and Callie had drinks at Joe's that night, and Addison witnessed how Erica removed a hair that was caught in Callie's lipgloss. Callie felt awkward seeing the way Addison was looking at her, and she went to Mark to dance with him. Erica saw how she left the bar with Mark a little later to have sex with him.<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n\nTrying to forget Addison's comments, Callie constantly wanted to have sex with Mark in the on-call rooms. Later that day, Erica was reading the article of Burke winning the Harper Avery. \"It's because I don't have a penis,\" Erica said, which made Callie feel awkward because she didn't realize just yet that Erica was talking about Burke. Erica asked to go to Joe's again that night, but Callie said she had this other thing. Mark then came over and asked Callie to talk to the nurses to make them stop boycotting him. Erica and Mark started bickering over whether or not he was a good guy, and they asked Callie's opinion, putting her in the middle. She didn't want to choose between them, so she stayed silent. A disappointed Erica walked away, and Callie asked Mark to go to an on-call room with her. In the scrub room, Erica asked if they were on for tonight, but Callie remember her that she had this other thing. Erica was mad that Callie didn't tell her about sleeping with Sloan (which was the other thing) and that she disappeared now that she got a boyfriend, especially because Callie was her new friend and she doesn't make friends easily. In the evening, Callie wanted to go make out with Mark again, but he was not in the mood because all his surgeries got cancelled. At Joe's bar, Callie confessed that she'd been avoiding Erica because Addison implied that they might be lesbians. Erica started laughing, and so did Callie, but they gave each other somewhat of an awkward look.<ref>[[The Becoming]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, Callie and Mark were having lunch. Callie asked again to have sex, but Mark (still remembering that Bailey called him a whore) told her that he wasn't interested in sex only. Erica joined them, and they started to seduce Mark by acting as if they wanted to do a threesome. Mark tried to resist by saying that the new Mark wasn't interested, but he eventually walked away. When Callie tried to get Mark into an on-call room, he started to talk about Erica Hahn and his fantasies about her. Callie didn't want to hear him talk about Erica in that way and walked away. That evening, Mark entered the elevator where Callie told Erica that Mark had been thinking about a threesome all day. When he finally admitted that he was, Erica said that he wouldn't be able to handle the two of them, but Mark thought that he would if he wanted to. \"You wouldn't find it intimidating?\" Erica asked, and while he said he wouldn't, Erica kissed Callie. Mark was speechless. \"See, too much for you,\" Erica said, and she left the elevator. Callie was completely speechless too, and she followed Mark to an on-call room.<ref>[[Losing My Mind]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Callie's father appears in Seattle to visit his daughter, he is angered by the news that George divorced Callie, initially throwing George against a wall, and then throwing Mark against a wall; and was angered even further by the fact that his daughter is now dating a girl. He attempts to take Callie home with him, but she refuses, and her father cuts her off financially. \n\n\nCallie met Arizona at the Emerald City Bar. While Callie was wiping tears in the bathroom, Arizona came in and told Callie that the hospital talked about her. Arizona said the talk about her was good and when she was over being upset, there'd be people lining up for her. When Callie asked for the names, Arizona leaned in and kissed her. \"I think you'll know,\" Arizona said. They both smiled and Arizona left.<ref>[[Beat Your Heart Out]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:xGeorgeDead-CallieShocked.jpg|thumb|px|Callie is in shock after learning that George is dead]]\nWhile operating on George, [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] stops working and after a moment [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] asks if anyone knows if George was a donor. [[George O'Malley|George]] is declared brain dead and Callie stumbles backwards and starts hyperventilating and Owen tries to calm her. Later in the scrub room, [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] joins Bailey and Callie who look at George and Lexie says the man is too tall to be George. Everyone goes to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] to ask her how she knows and not satisfied with her answer, Callie walks into the John Doe's room to see if he has a freckle George had on his hand (shaped like Texas) that Callie used to tease him about. She checks his hand and starts sobbing silently, confirming it is him. Callie and [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] talk about how it doesn't seem real when [[Louise O'Malley|George's mother]] approaches Callie and tells her that it will be too hard for her to decide what happens to George's organs and because in God's eyes Callie is still George's wife then Callie should decide, Callie accepts. She goes to Arizona in the pit for comfort and Arizona advises her to cry, scream, and eat donuts. Callie then decides that she shouldn't choose alone because George loved someone more than her, even while they were married. Callie tries to convince [[Alex Karev|Alex]] to tell Izzie what happened to George so she can help decide what should happen to his organs and so that she can say goodbye. After Izzie is told, Callie and Izzie go through the forms and decide George would want to give everything.  days later, Callie walks into the chief's office and asks him about her application to become an attending but he says that [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Good Mourning|Dr. Chang]] is still putting off his retirement so it won't happen. Callie complains that Chang is just a figurehead, she is the one who does all the work and is primarily paged and he is just a dinosaur, but the chief yells that he is too. Callie leaves, telling Richard he'll regret it and she deserves to be an attending because she is a superstar. Callie storms into an elevator with Bailey and suddenly breaks down crying.  days later, [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] hammers on Callie's apartment door and she comes out sobbing about losing George, having to get a new job and not seeing her friends again and that Arizona keeps bringing her donuts. Mark comforts her and then gets the idea of moving into the same building as Callie.<ref>[[Good Mourning]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:xMarckComfortsCallie.jpg|thumb|left|xpx|Mark comforts Callie]]\nCallie went into the hall and asked Mark for some wardrobe advice for her first day at Mercy West. After he gave his opinion, she changed in front of him and Lexie, leaving Lexie awkward and shocked. Later at work Callie meets Richard who was admitted after an accident and after confirming there were no big injuries, he just needed sutures, she passed him on to her intern, only on his th day of work. She is later approached by Arizona's old patient and her mother that in which Arizona asked her to perform a scan that she had said Mercy West could perform. When she gets home she gives out to Arizona but tells her she did do the tests although nothing abnormal came up.  days after George's death, Callie walks into Mark's apartment and into the shower she asks him to find out if the chief is going to take up work at Mercy West because that would be bad for her and he tells her he'll try and find out. She goes to leave but Lexie asks her first how gay she really is on a scale  through Gay because she and Mark live next door and Mark is very hot and she just walked on him while he was taking a shower but Callie relaxes her by saying that ever since Mark met Lexie, Callie's breasts were not the first things he looked at when he saw her. After her work day she goes to Joe's bar and relaxes with Arizona.<ref>[[Goodbye]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:xCallieMercyWest.jpg|thumb|px|Callie treats Richard ]]\n\nPrior to the merger, Callie got into an argument with Richard and resigned from Seattle Grace Hospital as he rejected her job application for the attending post. She then started working at Mercy West Medical Center. When the news of the merger of Seattle Grace Hospital and Mercy West Medical Center broke, she considered relocating to other states to work as she figured that Richard would fire her again during the merger. After being encouraged by Arizona, she intended ask Richard for her job back, but decided otherwise when she noticed that Richard was feeling down. In the end, Richard offered her the post of an attending surgeon.\n\n\nHaving children was always one of Callie's dreams. She and George tried before their divorce. When she brought up children to Arizona, she was shocked to learn that Arizona didn't want kids. They broke up over this issue but later reconciled when Arizona said she wanted to have babies with Callie after the hospital shooting.\n\n\nArizona won a prestigious Carter Madison Grant, which would allow her to spend three years in Malawi operating on kids who would otherwise never see a pediatric surgeon. Because Arizona was meant to be gone for three years, Callie planned to go with her. However, while they were at the airport, Arizona realized that Callie didn't really want to go. They fought and ultimately broke up, with Callie staying in Seattle and Arizona going to Malawi and Callie returning to Seattle and having sex with Mark, which resulted in Callie becoming pregnant with Mark's child.\n\n\n[[File:CallieCrashAccident.jpg|thumb|xpx|Callie went through the windshield when their car hit a truck.]]\nMoments after Arizona proposed to Callie, they ran into a truck that was stopped in the road and Callie went through the windshield since she had taken her seatbelt off to retrieve her cell phone, which Arizona had tossed back there. Upon their arrival at the hospital, Callie was presented with massive head and chest injuries, and internal hemorrhaging. She crashed in the ER, but the doctors at the hospital were able to resuscitate her and took her into surgery. She had large epidural and subdural hematomas, and severe internal injuries, which caused intensive hemorrhaging. Her pulse was unstable during the surgery, and the doctors agreed on a temporary abdominal closure, so she could become more stable. The question of whether or not to deliver the baby prematurely at  weeks remained an issue, as cardiovascular stats could be improved by early delivery. After the first surgery, Derek performed neurological tests on Callie to check her neurological functions, but she didn't respond. [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] opted for a percutaneous surgical procedure, as seen during a surgery with [[Preston Burke]], but [[Teddy Altman|Dr. Altman]] rejected her suggestion. After Callie's pressure dropped, she was brought back into surgery, during which [[Owen Hunt|Dr. Hunt]] agreed to Cristina's procedure as Callie remained unstable, and they were out of ideas. Pressure and pulse dropped again, causing Callie to crash. [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] is initially unable to regain her pulse, and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] was forced to deliver the baby early by C-section. The baby had no heartbeat upon delivery, but Arizona was able to get a heartbeat, and so was Dr. Webber, and both Callie and Sofia survived.<ref>[[Song Beneath the Song]], x</ref>\n\nThey named the baby [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]] and she and Callie were discharged from the hospital  weeks later.<ref>[[It's a Long Way Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter a series of unfortunate relationships, Callie got married to Arizona in a beautiful outdoor ceremony where [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] officiated. Callie's mother refused to attend the wedding because she was marrying another woman. Because of this, Callie told her father not to come, so he wouldn't have to choose between his wife and his daughter. At the reception, the newlyweds prepared for the father/daughter dance. Arizona's father danced with her for the dance while Callie tried to hide her disappointment that her father wasn't there for the dance. Mark Sloan offered to dance with Callie since her father wasn't present. Callie's father swooped in during the course of the dance and he cut in to dance with his daughter, saying he'd been waiting for it since he first held her in his arms.\n\n\nThough Callie wasn't on the plane that crashed in the woods, it had a huge impact on her life. Callie's best friend, Mark Sloan, died because of it and her wife, Arizona, had to have her leg amputated due to a severe infection. While waiting for the infection to get better (before the leg was amputated) Callie promised Arizona that she wouldn't cut off the leg. However, during the surgery in which Callie operated on Derek's hand, Alex came in, saying that Arizona was crashing because of her infected leg. Callie then ordered him to cut it off as Arizona would die if the leg wouldn't be amputated.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n[[File:ArizonaAmputatedleg.png|thumb|xpx|Arizona asks Callie how she can \"Snap out of this\" when she cut off Arizona's leg.]]\nFollowing the amputation, Arizona was mad at Callie for a long time. It got so bad that Callie slept at Mark's apartment. Callie stayed with Arizona and helped her whenever she could. Slowly, Arizona allowed Callie back into her life. Yet, Arizona still wasn't comfortable having sex, which is why Callie spent months without having sex. Arizona also refused to let Callie help her when she had problems with her residual limb because she wanted Callie to see her as her wife, not her patient. She ultimately allowed Callie to help by massaging her leg and later that night, they had sex for the first time since the plane crash.<ref>[[Idle Hands]], x</ref>\n\n\nThe doctors involved in the plane crash used the lawsuit money to buy the hospital at Callie's suggestion. They now serve as the hospital board.\n\n\nWhile attending [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] baby shower, Arizona asked Callie to have another baby and decided she'd like to carry this one. They chose a donor and soon, Arizona was pregnant. However, on the day of their first ultrasound, Callie was unable to come to the appointment because she was operating on [[Travis Reed]] and the surgery ran long. After she finished the surgery, Arizona came into the scrub room and told her that the OB did the ultrasound and couldn't find a heartbeat.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\n\nDuring the superstorm, Arizona escorted [[Lauren Boswell]] to an on-call room after Lauren asked where she could sleep. Arizona was just leaving when Lauren spoke up and asked her to stay there. Arizona shook her head but Lauren was adamant. In the end, Arizona agreed to keep her company, but when Lauren got too close, Arizona realized what was happening and tried once more to leave. This led to Lauren mentioning that it was okay to let loose once in a while. After thinking about this, Arizona locked the door to the on-call room and the two had sex. Callie found out about this when she came to look for Arizona and saw her wedding ring pinned to the scrub top Lauren was wearing. This happened because the two had accidentally switched shirts after sleeping together.\n\n\nAfter having to cut off a famous Olympic athlete's legs due to infection, she was sued for malpractice. Callie had never performed the procedure and had to leave a sponge in the patient due to complications. In the end, she won the lawsuit and everything was okay. Later that night, with the encouragement of her father, Callie went to Arizona's hotel room and asked her to come home. Callie did not know that at the time Dr. Murphy was having sex with Arizona.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:CallieDance.jpg|px|thumb|Callie's second underwear dance]]\nCallie always wanted many children. At Meredith's baby shower, the couple had an idea of trying for a second child. Arizona got pregnant with their second child but shortly afterward had a miscarriage.\n\n\nCallie met Penny online and they started dating. They had been dating for a few months when Callie introduced her to her friends, which led to the revelation that Penny had played a part in Derek's death. This put a serious strain on their relationship, especially with Penny's recent re-match to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Callie attempted to ignore her love for Penny, but was unable to do so. As her friends' hateful feelings towards Penny faded over time, Callie and Penny made up.\n\n\nPenny won the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]] and Callie decided to move to New York after Penny asked her to, taking Sofia along. She informed Arizona about her decision. Upset that Callie did not discuss this issue of uprooting Sofia from Seattle, Arizona decided to file a lawsuit against Callie for custody of Sofia. When trying to get her friends to testify for her in the custody hearing, Callie mentioned to Penny that she thought Meredith would be on Arizona's side because they were in a plane crash together, but by the end of the day she managed to get Owen and Meredith to testify for her.<ref>[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]], x</ref>\n\nBefore the custody hearing started, Arizona and Callie's respective lawyers tried to negotiate to prevent going to court but failed to come to a compromise. In court, after hearing both sides, Callie eventually lost the lawsuit as Arizona was granted the sole physical custody of Sofia.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref> Despite this ruling, Arizona, seeing how sad Callie was, agreed to let Callie have her for alternating school years and Christmases.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\n\nCallie is portrayed as a friendly and easy-going person who is able to work with everyone. Even the usually icy [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] eventually warmed up to her and asked her to be her maid of honor. She is well-regarded by her fellow attendings, both professionally and personally.\n\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nArizona initially brushed Callie off after kissing her in the bathroom at [[Emerald City Bar]]<ref>[[Beat Your Heart Out]], x</ref>, considering her to be a \"newborn\" as far as lesbian relationships go, but when Callie confronted Arizona at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]], she embarrassed herself and Arizona in front of Arizona's date, Julie.<ref>[[An Honest Mistake]], x</ref>\n[[File:Callie&Arizona.jpg|thumb|xpx|Callie and Arizona kiss for the first time.]]\nArizona later found Callie and admitted she misjudged and asked her to dinner; Callie initially played hard to get, saying she would check her schedule, but gave in quickly, sticking out her arm to stop the elevator and accepting the date.<ref>[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]], x</ref> They then entered a relationship. When George O'Malley died, Arizona kept bringing Callie donuts - because that's what helped her when her brother died - which made her more upset.\n\nAfter that, Callie started to work for Mercy West then comes back when both hospitals were merged. During that time, she and Arizona hit a rough patch, when she found out Arizona did not want kids. They soon broke up. They got back together after the shooting at the hospital when Arizona said she wanted kids, but only with Callie.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref> Not long after that, Arizona and Callie moved in together but broke up again when Arizona won a grant to set up a clinic in Africa to help kids and left Callie at the airport after figuring out she didn't really want to go.<ref>[[That's Me Trying]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.png|thumb|left|Wedding day!]]After a brief stay in Malawi, Arizona came back because she missed Callie, but Callie slammed the door in her face.<ref>[[Adrift and at Peace]], x</ref> Arizona spent some time trying to get Callie back unsuccessfully, but when she cornered Callie in an elevator, she found out that Callie was pregnant with Mark's baby.<ref>[[Start Me Up]], x</ref> Callie and Arizona got back together and agreed to raise the baby together.<ref>[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]], x</ref>\n\nAfter their baby shower, while she and Arizona were on their way to a weekend away, Mark texted Callie when he found out Lexie was in a relationship with Jackson and Arizona threw the phone in the backseat. They started to argue about Mark being involved in their lives and Callie took her seatbelt off to get her phone. While arguing, Callie told Arizona she was trying to do everything to make her, Mark, and the baby happy and would do anything for Arizona to make her happy. Arizona took a moment to think and then looked at Callie and said, \"Marry me.\" Before Callie could answer, she gasped and Arizona turned to see Callie was gasping at a truck in front of them that Arizona had not seen because she had taken her eyes off the road.<ref>[[This is How We Do It]], x</ref> They rear-ended the truck and while Arizona had minor injuries, Callie was ejected from the vehicle and nearly died. After two surgeries, including the premature delivery of [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|their daughter]], Callie woke up and told Arizona she'd marry her.<ref>[[Song Beneath the Song]], x</ref>\n\nLater, they married in a ceremony officiated by [[Miranda Bailey]]. Callie's parents left before the wedding because of her mother, who didn't approve of her getting married to a woman and having a baby out of wedlock. Mark ended up walking Callie down the aisle. Later, during the reception, there was a father-daughter dance which Arizona said she forgot to remove from the schedule, but Callie said she would sit it out. Mark then danced with her, only to have Callie's father cut in to tell her he's been looking forward to this day ever since he held her in his arms when she was a baby.<ref>[[White Wedding]], x</ref>\n\nArizona cheated on Callie with [[Lauren Boswell]] during the superstorm<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref> and their marriage was strained. However, after Callie's malpractice suit, she asked Arizona to move back home.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref> After April and Matthew's failed wedding, they bought a [[Callie and Arizona's House|house]] together.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref> They also recently decided to expand their family by having another child. However, the couple struggled to get past previous issues. They tried couples therapy and separation, but Callie discovered that she was happier without Arizona so they got divorced.<ref>[[Bend & Break]], x</ref>\n\nEventually, Arizona realized that Sofia needed both her parents and she decided to move back to New York with Sofia. Since Callie had split from Penny, the move rekindled the romance between Callie and Arizona.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMark and Callie were best friends, and Callie once referenced Mark as her \"work-husband\" and herself as his \"work-wife\" while they were both dating other people separately. While she and George were broken up, she met Mark at [[Emerald City Bar]] and invited him back to her hotel room. They started sleeping together again after she and George split up permanently. He helped her figure out that she liked [[Erica Hahn]]. Mark and Callie had a relationship which started with sex. When Callie starting seeing Erica, they stopped sleeping together and became friends and remained close friends. After Mark broke up with Lexie, Callie was the one who told Mark to get back together with her.\n[[File:Oncallroom.jpg|thumb|xpx|Mark and Callie after an encounter.]]\nWhen Arizona won the Carter Madison Grant and Callie prepared to move to Malawi with her, Mark told Callie that she shouldn't go to Africa if she doesn't want to. After Arizona realized she didn't want to go, she left Callie in an airport. After the break-up, Callie went to Cristina Yang's party, heartbroken about Arizona. She ended up moving in with Mark temporarily, just until she could get rid of the sub-letter at her place. After a night of drinking to celebrate Derek getting a grant for his Alzheimer's research, Callie approached Mark for a palate-cleansing \"sorbet.\" They started a short fling, which resulted in the conception of their daughter, [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]].\n\nAfter Arizona returned from Malawi, she decided she was in and the three raised Sofia together until Mark's death.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nCallie first met [[George O'Malley]] when he dislocated his shoulder after falling down a flight of stairs. She recognized him as the intern who single-handedly performed open-heart surgery in a stalled elevator, saving the patient's life. Clearly interested in getting to know him better, she gave him her number. However, George could not summon the courage to call her, so she started to ignore him.\n\n[[File:O'Callie.jpg|thumb|right|px|The newly-weds.]]\n\nGeorge eventually called her and asked her out, and began dating her shortly after. While looking for Callie one night, George stumbled onto her \"home\" in the hospital basement. She quickly explained that it was simply easier to stay at the hospital since she was always there, and defended that she wasn't crazy. He kissed her and the two proceeded to have sex.\n\nShortly before the hospital prom, Callie said \"I love you\" to George and later revealed that it was the first time she said that to a man. She was upset that George did not reciprocate her gesture, but he replied saying that he will only say it when he means it. The couple promptly made up after that although Izzie's strong dislike for Callie sometimes made it difficult.\n\nThe Chief later found out about Callie's living arrangements in the hospital and kicked her out because it was against protocol. She temporarily moved in with George at Meredith's, but he was uncomfortable with how quickly their relationship was progressing, so she left and moved into the [[Archfield Hotel]]. Callie made an effort toward reconciliation by inviting George to her hotel room one evening, but he stood her up to support Izzie in her time of need. Upset at how George was always placing Izzie and Meredith before her, Callie ended her relationship with George.\n\nThe same night, Callie went to Joe's, where she met Dr. Mark Sloan and invited him back to her room. After a brief fling, she refused Mark's continued advances but also discouraged George from chasing after her out of guilt, even though she was still in love with him. However, [[Alex Karev|Dr. Alex Karev]] overheard Callie talking about her fling with Mark, and informed George about it. George was furious that Callie had slept with another man, but was distracted when his father was admitted for heart and [[cancer]] surgery. He decided to shelve his relationship problems and placed his relationship with Callie on hold.\n\nCallie provided emotional support in spite of her strained relationship with George, bonding with his brothers and communicating the seriousness of their father's illness to his brothers. George rejected her help initially, stating that they had already broken up, but with encouragement from his father, George gradually began allowing Callie back into his life and family circle. When it seemed that Mr. O'Malley's condition was taking a turn for the better, George kissed a confused and stunned Callie. After George's father died, Callie provided physical support as George dealt with his grief through sex, but she was still shocked by George's sudden proposal.\n\nCallie accepted George's proposal, and the couple got married in [[Las Vegas]], leading Alex and Dr. Sydney Heron to dub her \ucCallie O\uMalley\ud. Although Addison was genuinely happy for Callie, Izzie was less than supportive of Callie's marriage. Callie eventually tired of Izzie's antagonism and threw down the gauntlet saying that if it came down to taking sides, George would definitely side with her. For a while, it seemed like that might be the case - George moved out of Meredith's house and stayed with Callie in her hotel room, paying what he believed to be his share of the expenses - $ a week. When Izzie insinuated to George that he made a mistake in getting married, he continued to avoid her at the hospital.\n\nHowever, Callie eventually confessed to George that their hotel bill was much more expensive than she'd led him to believe, and she did not receive a discount through family friends, as she had told him. She confessed that her parents \"had money\", making her well-off as well, leading George to accuse her of concealing her wealth from him while using his money to tip housekeeping. Word of Callie's wealth spread among the other interns, and Izzie commented on it during surgery with Callie. Angry that George had told Izzie her secret, Callie confronted him that evening with her suspicions about Izzie's true feelings for George, ultimately throwing him out of their room for the night. Confused, George confided to Izzie about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two.\n\nCallie reconciled with George at work the next day and survived a surprise visit from Callie's father - during which George impressed Callie by refusing to allow her father to help them financially - and George was allowed back into the hotel room. However, Callie was still unaware of his drunken one-night stand with Izzie the night before.\n\nCallie became increasingly suspicious of George and Izzie after witnessing the two of them hanging out together on several occasions. Not knowing what else to do, Callie confronted Izzie in an elevator, begging her to return George to her. Subsequently, Callie decided to have a baby with George, a request to which he agrees.\n\nCallie was informed later about George and Izzie's affair leading to George ending the marriage. Callie was angry at first and wanted to talk to Izzie about it and asked her to meet her in the hospital cafeteria, but Izzie thought that Callie actually wanted to beat her up. That day before the lunch break, everyone knew about the \"fight\" that was going to happen. By acting as if the fight was really going to happen in front of everyone in the cafeteria, Callie was severely humiliated by Izzie.\n\nLater on, Callie confessed to Arizona that she wished for Izzie to die when George left her to start a relationship with Izzie, but she deeply regretted this when Izzie was diagnosed with cancer. When she found out that George enlisted in the army, she wanted to stop him and planned an intervention with Bailey and George's friends, not knowing that George was the John Doe trauma patient they just got. When he died, Callie broke down.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Erica Hahn and Callie kiss.]]After Callie and George got a divorce, she started a friends with benefits relationship with Mark Sloan. During this relationship, Callie also started becoming close with Erica Hahn. Mark began to tease the two about how close they were, talking about them kissing and asking Callie if she ever thought about grabbing Erica's hair in surgery and kissing her. This was the start of Callie discovering her sexuality. When Addison Montgomery came back to Seattle Grace for a special case, she asked Callie if she was 'speaking the vagina monologues now', after seeing how close Callie and Hahn were.<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref> Callie began using Mark for sex more, to convince herself she wasn't attracted to Hahn, but he eventually let her go and told her to go after Erica.\n\nCallie finally got the courage up and kissed Hahn,<ref>[[Freedom, Part ]], x</ref> and the day afterward, they ignored each other.<ref>[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]], x</ref> After talking about it with Hahn, they decided to take their relationship slow and explore together at a pace they were comfortable with.<ref>[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]], x</ref> The first time they had sex, Callie didn't enjoy it. She voiced her concerns to Mark, who didn't want to hear about it. Later, Callie and Hahn spoke and Hahn said she had a great night, which confused Callie. She then went back to Mark, and asked him to \"teach her\" his technique, because she wanted to be \"good at this\". After this, Callie and Hahn tried again, and she and Hahn started going out.<ref>[[There's No 'I' in Team]], x</ref> One morning, Erica looked at Callie and compared her realization that she was a lesbian to when she got glasses and could see everything clearly again. Her emotional confession scared Callie a lot.<ref>[[Life During Wartime]], x</ref> After Hahn discovered that Izzie Stevens had stolen a heart for Denny Duquette, which resulted in one of her patients missing out on a heart, she told Callie that she was going to report the hospital for not reporting the situation to UNOS. Callie asked her what good it would do, starting a fight between them with Erica complaining that Callie couldn't \"kind of be a lesbian\".<ref>[[Rise Up]], x</ref> After their fight, Erica quit her job as Head of Cardio at Seattle Grace and left Seattle.<ref>[[These Ties That Bind]], x</ref> She hasn't returned since.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex and Callie slept together after a big surgery involving reconstruction of a man's legs was successful when Callie was a th-year resident. No one knew at the time, but the relations were later revealed when Callie gave her speech at Lecture Day.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n\n[[Penelope Blake|Penny Blake]]\n[[File:CallierevealsPenny.png|thumb|xpx]]\nCallie was dating Penny Blake. She's the doctor who didn't get a CT for Derek, a decision that ultimately led to his death. Penny never told Callie this as she wasn't aware that Derek and Callie were close. The relationship had Callie feeling really good, right up until the point that Meredith revealed who Penny was. Callie was caught in the middle, as she wanted to be there for Meredith, but also couldn't turn off her feelings for Penny.\n\nWhen Penny started to work at Grey Sloan Memorial and Meredith didn't treat her as she'd treat other residents, Callie tried to help out by talking to Meredith and other attendings, but they just dismissed her as too protective of her girlfriend. Penny also made it very clear that she didn't need Callie to stand up for her as she could that herself.\n\nAfter Penny received a prestigious offer to work in New York for a year,<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref> Callie decided to go with her.<ref>[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]], x</ref> After a big and nasty custody battle with Arizona, who didn't want Sofia to move to New York with them, Arizona gained full custody of Sofia.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref> This prompted Callie to end her relationship with Penny, as she couldn't leave her daughter behind.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> Later, Arizona decided to adjust the custody arrangement and allow Callie to take Sofia to New York, so she could go with Penny and be happy.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> Some time after the move, Callie and Penny broke up.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nThey became close when Callie moved in with her after Burke left Yang and George left Callie. Together, they purchased an apartment and lived there until Owen and Cristina moved out. They remained fairly close throughout the years as Yang is the godmother to Sofia. The friendship faded over the years as both became more invested in their relationships.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nOwen and Callie became closer after the plane crash, which caused both of their wives to change significantly. After leaving their spouses, they bonded over their shared experience of trying to find new love.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith and Callie has some significant bonding over time after the death of George. They became much closer after Arizona cheated on Callie, as Callie temporarily lived in Meredith's house.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nCallie and Addison were good friends while they worked together in Seattle. In fact, Callie was one of the few people to find out that Addison had had an abortion. Addison came back from L.A. when Callie was in a car accident to take care of her and the baby and ended up delivering Sofia.\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nBailey and Callie became good friends when they worked together in Seattle. In fact, Miranda and Callie had such a tight bond that they enjoyed girls nights, and talked about relationships together. Miranda was the second person Callie went to when she began to see [[Erica Hahn]]. Callie was a bridesmaid at Bailey's wedding.\n\n\nCallie was first introduced as the [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic resident]] who fixed George's dislocated shoulder in the ER.\n\nAt the end of Callie's fourth year of residency, she was named the new [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]] but was later demoted and the position of chief resident was given to [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]], who had tried to cover up for her until the ploy was discovered by Chief Webber.\n\nNearing the end of her residency, Callie put in a request for an attending position at Seattle Grace Hospital, but since her superior was putting off retirement, the Chief couldn't agree to her request. Callie, who basically ran the ortho department as the best ortho surgeon on staff, then quit and took an attending position at [[Mercy West Medical Center]], but not long after, she returned to Seattle Grace Hospital, as both hospitals were set to merge to become [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], where Callie continued to work as an attending. At some point, after years of being an attending, Callie was promoted to head the orthopedic surgery department.\n\nAfter the plane crash, Callie and  other doctors invested the money from the lawsuit and bought the hospital with financial help from the Harper Avery Foundation, creating [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where Callie is a board member.\n\nHighlights of Callie's career include making [[Sunder Atluri|a man]] with severely misshapen legs walk again, being the first surgeon ever to build cartilage from scratch, saving Derek's hand after the plane crash and building robotic prosthetic limbs to make amputees walk again. Callie has given a speech at the TED conference about her accomplishments.\n\nCallie's current work situation is unknown, but she mentioned to Bailey that she had received offers from NYU and Columbia, amongst others. Wherever she ended up is a step down from her position as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Orthopedic Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] as all the offers were just for an Attending position.\n\n\n*Callie had a pet ferret for nine years.<ref>[[Scars and Souvenirs]], x</ref>\n*Callie speaks Spanish fluently.<ref>[[Sweet Surrender]], x</ref>\n*She dislikes sandwiches and salad, but she likes pizza.<ref>[[What a Difference a Day Makes]], x</ref>\n*She is Catholic.\n*During her brief marriage to [[George O'Malley]], she was referred to as \"Callie O'Malley\". Even after the divorce and George's death, [[Louise O'Malley]] still considered her to be part of the family.\n*She did sunrise yoga with [[Erica Hahn|Erica]].<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n*Callie's apartment number in Seattle was .<ref>[[Good Mourning]], x</ref>\n*Callie suffers from glossophobia, the fear of speaking in public.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n*Callie doesn't seem to have a problem with people seeing her in her underwear, evidenced by the time she didn't put on pants while talking to Richard after he caught her dancing in her underwear, when she peed in front of Izzie and Meredith, and later when she changed into her scrubs in a crowded ER.\n*Callie danced in her underwear twice on the show. The first time in \"[[I Am a Tree]]\" when Richard caught her in the basement, and the second time at the end of \"[[I Bet It Stung]]\" when she returned home to her apartment. During both times, Callie wore the same white underwear.\n*Her [[United States Medical Licensing Exam#Step |intern exam]] flash cards are legendary; her fifth-year study method for the [[Board Certification|board certification]] holds the same reputation.\n*Although not stated directly in dialogue, Callie is [[Board Certification|board certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic surgery]] as she developed a study method, and later taught to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]].\n*Callie's dream (other than ortho) was to be a mom. This dream is fulfilled now that she has [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]].\n*Everyone calls her Callie, except for her father, [[Carlos Torres|Carlos]], her ex-wife, [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], and her ex-girlfriend, [[Penelope Blake|Penny]], who call her Calliope.\n*Her blood type is A+.<ref>[[Song Beneath the Song]], x</ref>\n*While her first appearance is [[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]], it is shown in [[The Time Warp]] that she was at the hospital earlier than that as she began her residency at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n*She likes to dance.\n*Both Callie and [[Aria Torres|her sister]] have musical names. The name Calliope means \"beautiful voice\" in Greek and Aria means \"melody\" in Italian.\n*Callie didn't like any of the cute baby names Arizona chose, so Arizona buried the cute names in a bunch of terrible names. Unfortunately, her plan backfired when Callie said she loved Agamemnon.\n**Callie's middle name, Iphigenia, was the daughter of Agamemnon in Greek myth. Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter to the gods in hope for his ships to sail.\n*She has the bad habit of just checking whose calls she missed instead of actually listening to the voicemail that the caller left her.<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n*She used to live in the hospital basement.\n*In [[Walking Tall]], dialogue confirms that Callie is the department head of orthopedic surgery.\n**Callie's appointment to head of ortho happened off-screen. During [[I Choose You]] she said to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], at the time, she negotiated her contract for the department head position, which resulted in a very high salary.\n*Callie can go seven hours in the OR without taking a pee break.\n*Callie has a personalized scrub cap that is mostly silver with red arches.\n*She smiles when she sleeps.<ref>[[Bend & Break]], x</ref>\n*Sofia calls her Mama.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref>\n*Her favorite place to have sex in the hospital was the artificial limb room.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n*She wanted to have children ever since she got a doll for Christmas when she was four.<ref>[[This is How We Do It]], x</ref>\n*Callie appeared in  episodes, making her the longest running queer character in television history.\n*While married to Arizona, Callie pinned her wedding ring to the inside of her scrub top while working.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n*She likes sudoku.<ref>[[She's Gone]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nCallieTorres.png\nxCallieTorres.png\nxCallieTorres.png\nxCallieTorres.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Callie-centric or are otherwise very informative about her life.\n*[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\n*[[My Favorite Mistake]]\n*[[Freedom, Part ]]\n*[[Freedom, Part ]]\n*[[Brave New World]]\n*[[Invasion]]\n*[[The Time Warp]]\n*[[Song Beneath the Song]]\n*[[It's a Long Way Back]]\n*[[White Wedding]]\n*[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]]\n*[[Throwing it All Away]]\n*[[Bend & Break]]\n*[[Mama Tried]]\n\n\n:'''Callie (to [[Carlos Torres|Carlos]]):''' You can't pray away the gay!<ref>[[Invasion]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''[[Carlos Torres|Carlos]]:''' Leviticus--\"Thou shall not lie with a man as one lies with a female.

[[Danielle (All Eyez on Me)|Danielle]] hit her trick too soon, which knocked them all out of sync. Maxine had cuts on her face, but her pulse was racing and her BP was high, so they ordered cardiac testing. Amelia did a neuro exam, which was clear, but she decided to run a CT anyway. The CT showed a mild concussion. Alex recommended that she learn to control stress because of her BP. In the ER, her heart rate spiked and she lost pulse. She was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which caused her rapid heart rate. Due to the severity of her condition, she was rushed into surgery to repair it.

While an intern, her resident was [[Izzie Stevens]] until reassigned to [[George O'Malley]].\n\n\n\nOn her first day of internship, she was assigned to [[Izzie Stevens]], who took the group on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules. Her interns viewed her as the dud, having heard that she'd spent some time on probation after killing someone.\n\nAfter they spent the day saving a deer with Izzie, she said that they were the dud interns.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nClaire, Graciella, Leo, and Mitch all attended a housewarming party thrown by George and Lexie. They all ended up coming to work drunk the next day. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nThe night after the party, the interns planned a darts tournament. When George invited Izzie, they started considering dropping out because they didn't want to play darts with their boss. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural as practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella was affected by George's death. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program. She survived the first round of layoffs. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella participated in a documentary someone made about the doctors at the hospital. During the documentary, she went through two different relationships and decided to rethink her approach. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella was locked down in peds when [[Gary Clark]] brought a gun to the hospital. She informed [[Arizona Robbins]] and [[Callie Torres]] when [[Ruby Kendall|Ruby Kendall's]] appendix burst. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Pierce Halley]]\nShe and Pierce dated for two weeks after Megan left him. She broke up with him when she saw him talking to Megan. He was unaffected by the news. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n[[Charles Percy]]\nShe developed a crush on Charles after dumping Pierce. They hung out at the bar together, but he made it clear they were just friends. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella was one of the many interns who befriended George and went to his intern parties. She was also one of the many that knew Lexie loved George.\n\nShe and [[Steve Mostow]] are best friends. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nShe originally disliked Izzie, calling her a \"dud\" resident. When Izzie came back to work, Graciella was much nicer, claiming that her mother's church prayed for Izzie. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nDr. Guzman originally worked as an [[Internship|intern]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She worked as an intern first for Izzie and then for George.

They don't look like me, which has its perks. Except that my family treated me like I was pretty. They expected nothing from me, ever. Never pushed me, never thought to. So I had to push myself. Hard.|'''Jackson Avery'''}}\n\n'''Jackson Avery''' is the\uaformer [[Attending#Department Head|Head]]\uaof [[Plastic Surgery]] and [[Attending|attending]] [[Otolaryngology|ENT]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and was one of the staff members who joined from [[Mercy West Medical Center]] after the merger. He is also a former member of the board and the de facto board chairman. Jackson was married to\ua[[April Kepner]] with whom he has a daughter and a deceased son. He relocated to Boston to take over the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]] and work towards achieving equity in medical care. A newly divorced April and their daughter, [[Harriet Kepner-Avery|Harriet]] moved with him so he could continue being an active and present father. While in Boston, he and April rekindled their romance.\n\n\n\nJackson is the grandson of\ua[[Harper Avery|Dr. Harper Avery]], one of the most famous surgeons in the country and the namesake of the prestigious Harper Avery Award. He grew up hearing about the nobility of being a surgeon at his grandfather's dinner table, which inspired him to become a surgeon. His family never pushed him academically, so he pushed himself; he didn't even tell his family that he had taken the MCAT until he aced it.\n\nNot much is known about Jackson's life before he became a surgeon, but it is known that although he looks up to [[Harper Avery|his grandfather]], he detests being compared to him. He also refuses to use his name in order to progress in his career. Jackson is no doubt a \"mama's boy\" and is extremely protective of the people he cares about \u specifically [[April Kepner]], whom he claims is his only remaining friend in [[Seattle]].\n\n\nDuring the shooting at the hospital, Jackson and Cristina performed emergency surgery on [[Derek Shepherd]], saving his life. At one point during the surgery, grieving widower, [[Gary Clark]] held them at gunpoint. Jackson saved everyone\us lives by making it seem as though Derek had flatlined. This pleased [[Gary Clark]] and he was then convinced to leave them in peace.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\nBefore the shooting, Jackson was friends with fellow Mercy West resident, Charles Percy. Percy was killed during the shooting and this had a great impact on Jackson. For months following the shooting, he had nightmares about the event. He and April Kepner also moved into Meredith's house as both their friends had been killed and Meredith felt they needed support.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\nThere was later a shooting at a local college and Jackson, alongside Drs. Altman and Yang found out they were operating on the shooter. He refused to continue and walked out of the OR, likely a response to the Gary Clark shooting. However, he's later admonished by Alex, who reminds him that mass shooters are sick people with a family that still love them. After this, Jackson sits down with the shooter's mother and reassures her that her son was still alive.<ref>[[Disarm]], x</ref>\n\n\nAt the request of Mark, Jackson attempted to get close to Lexie as Mark wanted to find out if she was miserable without him. However, Lexie and Jackson\uaactually grew closer to one another and eventually had sex in the shower, which marked the start of their relationship. Mark didn't want to let go of Lexie but eventually did so, though Jackson kept noticing that Lexie couldn't seem to get over him, despite her claims that she had. When Mark noticed Jackson's interest in and talent for plastic surgery, Jackson decided to pursue that specialty. However, he avoided surgery with Mark because of Lexie's lingering feelings for Mark. This bugged him and he decided to break up with Lexie. He offered her the chance to tell him that he shouldn't do it, but she couldn't bring herself to do so.\n\nJackson then dove into plastics and quickly formed The Plastics Posse with Mark, who was eager to teach him.\n\n\nAfter Arizona, Derek, Meredith and Cristina sued Seattle Grace Mercy West because of the plane crash, the hospital was forced to pay out a multi-million dollar settlement. After Owen and [[Alana Cahill]] tried to made some cost-cutting changes, they determined it wasn't enough and they'd be forced to sell the hospital. Alana brokered a deal to sell to Pegasus while the doctors from the settlement worked together to come up with the money they needed to buy it themselves. To stop the deal from going through before they could get the money together, they quit en masse, causing Pegasus to pull out of the deal. They then went to Catherine Avery, who put up the rest of the money and helped them purchase the hospital. As part of the deal, she put Jackson on the hospital board.\n\n\nOn the day of April's wedding, Jackson runs into April at the hospital as she is looking for Meredith and Cristina and asks him if he is coming to her wedding. After realizing that she really wants him there, Jackson decides to go. When Jackson and Stephanie arrive at April's wedding, Jackson picks up a box that contains a butterfly and as it flies into the air, Jackson remembers what April told him about wanting butterflies at her wedding, but brushes it off. As April is walking down the aisle, Jackson smiles at the beautiful bride. When the priest asks everyone if they agree to support Matthew and April's marriage, April locks eyes with Jackson as he begins to realize what is really happening. Everyone says yes except Jackson. He then turns to Stephanie and says \"I'm sorry\" then stands up then sits back down. Finally, Jackson takes a deep breath and stands up again and says,\ua\"I love you. I always have. I love everything about you - even the things that I don't like, I love. And I want you with me. I love you and I think that you love me, too. Do you?\" Matthew is visibly upset, Jackson looks scared and vulnerable, and April looks like she is in shock and takes a deep breath.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nNot too long after their wedding, Jackson and April got into a fight about how they would raise their hypothetical children, especially regarding religion and beliefs. April was offended and felt that Jackson loved her despite her religion and therefore just tolerated her. April then left their home and went to live with Arizona and Callie for a while.\n\nUpon running into April as she came to retrieve her iPod, Jackson expressed regret over the ridiculing her beliefs. He said they loved one another and made vows to push through conversations like this, as it was one they would have to have at some point. He stressed they ultimately shared the same values. She agreed, except that he would not agree if she were to tell their future children that their Creator loved. He asked her to take a break from their hypothetical children, but she revealed they couldn't as she was pregnant.\n\nThe couple\uastarted to prepare for their child. Their world was shattered when Jackson overheard a conversation between Stephanie and Nicole Herman about their son, as they discussed the possibility of the baby suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta. Jackson had to break the news to April, who avoided it by diving into work. At the end of the day, Jackson took her outside to talk and she broke down in his arms as she revealed the sex of their baby to him. They then consulted with Arizona and Nicole to find out which type of OI their baby was suffering from. Unfortunately, their son was diagnosed with type II, meaning he would die mere hours after birth and was also at risk for intrauterine fractures. Guided by Catherine, Jackson and April decided to induce labor, baptize their boy, and hold him until his final breath. April initially agreed to the plan, but she took her faith and started praying for a miracle. Jackson brought up that wouldn't happen and April revealed her anger and disappointment in\uaGod. Jackson then went to the chapel to ask God to show up for April. April found her faith again through a patient who had lost her husband earlier that day. She then decided to name their boy Samuel Norbert Avery, the final step she had to take to come to terms with the plan. Jackson agreed to the name and their plan was put into motion. Jackson and April held their son and soaked in every moment with him until his passing. Afterward, Jackson took April home, where he continued to care for her. He decided to give her space as he felt she needed it in order to come to terms with what had happened.\n\nApril first returned to the hospital for Nicole's surgery. Jackson stayed by her side all day until he went to check on a patient of his in the ICU. She returned to work not long after, and choose to avoid dealing with her pain by becoming a tougher version of herself. She wanted to have sex all the time, which had Jackson worried, but she assured him she didn't need the space and that she was still herself.\uaJackson filled the void in his life by turning to teaching, recruiting Ben to join the new version of the Plastics Posse.\n\n\nApril joined the army as a doctor and did a tour in Jordan with Owen Hunt. While she was gone her marriage with Jackson deteriorated. She became pregnant with their second child, Harriet, and they later divorced and have joint custody of their daughter.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Jackson meets his father.]]\nJackson tracked down his father and took a case in the nearby\ua[[Avery Medical Center--Bozeman]]. He requested Meredith to join him, but knowing the real reason behind his trip, Catherine had April take her place as she would offer a better support system. After hitting a dead end on the case, Jackson spent the night at his father's diner and got drunk. April eventually found him there, but he yelled at her and left. April ended up talking with Robert Avery and discovered his identity. She then went to confront Jackson about this and pressed him to talk to his father. Jackson went to do so and told him the truth. They sat down and Jackson updated him\uaabout his life. Robert talked about how he met Catherine and how he walked out because of her crushing expectations. Jackson was overwhelmed and left after realizing Robert didn't know who he was as a person. After coming up with a fix for the case, Jackson returned to the diner to tell his father that he was glad they met, but there wouldn't be a next time because Robert broke the promise you make when you become a parent. He told Robert he wasn't his father and left.<ref>[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing the death of his grandfather, Jackson inherited a quarter billion dollars. He bought a boat to relax on and then decided that he felt sidetracked lately, so he talked to Bailey and asked her to accept a large donation in order to set up a surgical contest that would fund projects rather than just award one surgeon like the Harper Avery Award. His name couldn't be anywhere near it since he wanted to participate. Bailey accepted and later got Richard to run it, since she wanted to participate, too.\n\nJackson also realized he had feelings for Maggie, and after learning that she reciprocated them, they began a relationship. After Maggie saved April's life, his and Maggie's relationship deepened, especially after April left the hospital and got remarried to Matthew. Though Jackson and Maggie hit a bump in their relationship over Jackson's newfound interest in religion and faith, they eventually reconciled when they learned about Catherine's tumor. Maggie helped Jackson through the process, using the death of her own mother as a guide.\n\n\nJackson prayed to God to bring April back after she fell into a ravine with a river that left her asystolic and severely hypothermic. She recovered without deficits. That left Jackson to look for spirituality in his own life.\n\nThe day after Alex and Jo's wedding, he noticed a hungover Maggie and Andrew and wondered why people numb life's most beautiful moments with alcohol. He decided they would all walk to work together to enjoy the weather. He was intrigued by April's spontaneous wedding, as their own wedding had been, too, and wondered if that was how faith worked. Andrew pulled him and Maggie out of the way of a car that was about to hit them. While checking on [[Cece Colvin|the driver]] and [[Nisha]], who was hit, Jackson thanked Andrew for saving their lives. At the hospital, Jackson worked on Nisha's leg and he wondered if Nisha getting hit by her own matchmaker was the beginning of a chain of events that were meant to be, even hinting that God may be behind it, working in mysterious ways. That night at home, Jackson confided in Maggie that, much to his own surprise, he had started to believe in something and that he felt it pulsating through him. He wanted to leap and trust that something would catch him as April and Matthew did. Maggie pointed out they got married. He said he wanted to trust it. Thinking he was proposing, Maggie claimed they were out of milk and ran out.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nJackson himself returned to the hospital because Nisha spiked a fever. Nisha flirted with him. Jackson had to resuscitate Cece while Nisha also became tachycardic and eventually septic. Jackson and Meredith agreed Cece was too aggressive with her matchmaking attempts. Nisha was found to have necrotizing fasciitis. He and Levi debrided her wound in the hyperbaric chamber and Jackson found out through him that Maggie was avoiding him because she thought he had proposed. Unfortunately, Nisha went into V-fib. Jackson performed CPR for  minutes before calling the time of death. Distraught over the loss and the apparent lack of a deeper meaning behind the accident, he wanted to get out, but he had to wait for the chamber to depressurize. After work, Jackson and Maggie talked. He had trouble understanding why they got to live while Nisha didn't. Maggie suggested he had some PTSD after his family empire crumbled and April leaving. Jackson pointed out there were also good things in his life and told her that he loved her. She reciprocated. He apologized for the accidental proposal and said he had some stuff to figure out.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nHe decided to go on a spontaneous spiritual quest. He took a leave of absence and left Maggie a voice mail to tell her he needed to take a step back from his life and look at the bigger picture. He didn't tell her face to face because he knew he couldn't leave if he saw her face when he told her he needed time to find answers to his big life questions.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref> He traveled to national parks to find himself in nature. He sent Maggie a picture of a tree.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nHe briefly returned to the hospital to operate on [[Rafi Elshami]], a boy with extensive scapular osteochondroma. Rafi and his father Aamir shared their s'mores with him by a creek in Oregon so in return, Jackson arranged the surgery pro bono. Before surgery, he invited Maggie to talk over dinner, but she avoided him with her patients as an excuse. Pathology revealed the tumors were malignant, so they prepared to remove the scapula altogether, but Maggie inspired Jackson to try extracorporeal radiation to save Rafi's mobility. The plan worked. Afterward, Jackson visited Maggie in her lab and told her he was done with his trips as doing his work made him feel more connected to something larger than him, and Maggie was a huge part of that. He apologized for the way he left so abruptly. She forgave him and they shared a kiss.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref> He remained on his best behavior to make up for his trips by bringing Maggie coffee and food in her lab. On Day of the Dead, she found herself missing her mother and wanting to be alone, so he gave her some time while bringing marigolds to the lab.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nTheir relationship flourished until Maggie saw texts from a woman named Kate on his phone that included heart emojis. Maggie assumed he was cheating, but he explained he was just a friend he had met during his nature trips. The nature helped him with his PTSD and he ran into Kate, who was doing similar trips to process her brother's death. He showed her all the texts and explained it was nice to talk to people who had been through the same as him. She inquired about those people and he admitted he still talked to April from time to time. Maggie admitted she never pictured him blowing up their relationship. He was surprised she ever pictured their relationship ending. Jackson then confessed he talked to other women because Maggie never shared her feelings about anything. Maggie told him that she imagined he'd find a priest on his spiritual quest and come back with answers, but instead, he came back with more questions, which he then took to other women. She had always been five steps ahead of everyone in her life, which is why she never learned to communicate her feelings, but now she felt like he was five steps ahead of her and she didn't know how to catch up. She inquired about what he talked about with Kate. He replied that the only thing he and April never saw eye to eye on was God and now that he finally believed, April had married someone else. He had realized he needed to grieve the end of that marriage and what Harriet had lost because of it, and he didn't know how to talk to Maggie about it. Upset, Maggie got her stuff and left the penthouse.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Maggie tells Jackson about his mother's cancer.]]\nWith a windstorm heading towards the city, Jackson avoided Maggie at work. He scrubbed in with Teddy and Owen and witnessed her telling him about her pregnancy with his child. Owen was baffled while Teddy was paged away to the ER, but Jackson told him that even though he was the last to find out about Harriet, it was the best thing that ever happened to him. Jackson's patient and his wife had a tumultuous history with lots of fighting, which made Jackson find Maggie to discuss their first big fight. However, Jackson was surprised when Maggie told him that his mother had a grade III chondrosarcoma on her spine.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nShe showed him the scans and he felt helpless. Jackson tried to reach his mother, but it went straight to voicemail. He then focused on getting the elevators back on, which had been stuck ever since a power outage caused by the storm. Jackson saved [[Jed Lundberg|Jed Lundberg's]] legs when they were crushed when an elevator suddenly started working again. Afterward, Jackson found Richard and inquired if he had heard from Catherine at all. Since he hadn't, Jackson took him someplace quiet to tell about her cancer.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nRichard and Jackson had dinner with Catherine as soon as she flew back to Seattle, but they avoided talking about the cancer. Jackson had a hard time accepting the diagnosis, rendering him unable to properly share his feelings with Maggie. The next day, they had a special pelvic exenteration together that would spare the uterus using a technique developed by Catherine. In surgery, the doctors hit a snag when the uterine tissue proved too friable to spare the uterus, disrupting their entire plan. They performed a hysterectomy. Catherine angrily left the OR when Jackson suggested taking over for her. After the surgery, he and Richard found Catherine fuming in a lounge. She said she hadn't told them because she wasn't ready to talk to them about it yet, because it would make the cancer painfully real for her. They assured her they could handle the bad news and that they would support her as her family. She then broke down as reality hit her and they comforted her.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of the surgery, Jackson visited Catherine with Harriet. She asked him and Richard to refrain from being doctors around her and instead support her as her son and husband. Tom and Amelia came in to explain their approach. Catherine needed a moment to herself and went to an empty OR. Jackson followed her there and she shared that ever since her first solo surgery, she had been singing \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" in her head to help her get through stressful situations. He said he had sung to himself, too, in his first solo surgery. She revealed she had snuck into the gallery to see it and they made a deal to sneak into the gallery together to see Harriet's first surgery. Afterward, Catherine gave Jackson documents declaring him the leader of the Foundation in case she didn't make it out alive as well as a detailed party plan in case the surgery would be a success. Jackson then walked her back to her room. Right before the surgery, Jackson surprised her by playing \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" in the OR. After a dance with the entire staff, Catherine got settled on the table.\n\nA nervous Jackson kept pacing up in the gallery. While he wanted to see, he grew increasingly frustrated by Tom's laid-back attitude and took a walk. He sat down on a gurney and Maggie sat down with him. He told her his mother had always been larger than life. He couldn't imagine a room without her in it after all the meddling she had done in his life and thinking about her not being there made him feel like a scared little kid. She understood the feeling and comforted him as he broke down in tears. The surgery went relatively well, leaving behind a small piece of the tumor as to not damage Catherine's brachial plexus and save her career. Catherine was relieved that they saved her life and her career and announced that they would still have the success party, albeit in a few months so that she could dance. Later that night, Maggie brought Jackson a beverage as he sat by his mother's side.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Catherine was positive right after the surgery, her attitude worsened as she was facing a tough recovery over the holidays. She went to bed early on Christmas Eve and continued to refuse help. Jackson and Maggie attended the Karevs' NYE party, but Maggie noticed his head was elsewhere, so they went home to watch the ball drop from their bed. During one of their visits to Catherine and Richard's house, Jackson and Maggie witnessed as Catherine fell on the treadmill and broke down crying. Jackson couldn't stand to see her like that and went to take a walk in the garden. Maggie suggested a movie night to celebrate Valentine's Day to distract him. She knew he was hurting but didn't know how to make it better. He didn't know either. She confessed she had a fleeting thought of wanting to kill herself in the worst moments of her mother's illness and how the pain and fear were so strong that she experienced physical discomforts, which Jackson recognized.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie worked on sharing her feelings more, which Jackson appreciated. Jackson saved the hand of a kid who got shot at a parade, which added to Jackson's fear of Harriet getting shot in public.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref> Jackson surprised Maggie by turning a weekend away she agreed to into a camping trip. He packed his car with supplies and assured her she'd love it. However, Maggie canceled the trip when she decided to stay to support Amelia, who was having a rough time when Betty turned up amongst the overdoses flooding the ER. Jackson took care of an unhoused man's injured feet and felt guilty for having talked about his camping trip and three pairs of ski boots in front of him. He tried to find a shelter for him so he could continue to care for his feet but to no avail. He then decided to give Ralph all of his camping equipment, hoping it would last him through the waitlist period before landing a place at a shelter.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nJackson hosted a party for Catherine at his penthouse in honor of Amelia and Tom, whom he didn't particularly like given his history with April. Catherine didn't want to attend and took a long time to get there. When she finally did, Jackson gathered everyone for a speech, but it was interrupted by Tom and Owen fighting and then smoke coming from the kitchen. The penthouse was evacuated and Ben later informed Jackson they found plastic in the oven. Out on the street, Catherine told her son she hadn't meant to be ungrateful. She then suggested the two of them and Richard and Maggie celebrate in the limo, which they did with burgers, fries, and champagne. Having learned to enjoy every moment from Bailey, Catherine decided she wanted to celebrate every scan with her family that way.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the fire, Jackson temporarily moved in with Maggie and her sisters and cooked them dinner. At work, Jo was ranting about how Alex's mother was pushing her to have kids now and how kids were terrible, which offended Jackson. She later apologized and he told her that kids can give you a reason to live when life tries to ruin you.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nAs part of his spray-on skin research, Jackson initiated a project with tilapia skin to treat severe burns with less scarring than the usual methods. Meanwhile, he supported Maggie as she prepared herself to appear on Good Morning Seattle to talk about herself after she let slip her parentage in a medical podcast, which made for big news in the medical community. During Maggie's interview, Jo took it as a sign that she needed to find her own parents. Jackson warned her it could go badly, citing his own experience with his father, which only caused him more pain. Afterward, Maggie visited him in his lab. While kissing, they got a little competitive over their innovative projects, both striving to be the best.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine's road to recovery remained difficult. She opted not to return to work when planned, only telling her family \"cancer card.\" Jackson worried about her and started thinking Richard was keeping something from him about her, but Richard assured him that wasn't true. They worked on a gender non-binary patient together, which required Jackson to teach Richard the right pronouns.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and Meredith lured Catherine back to work with a triple transplant patient, for whom they finally found a match. The transplant included the abdominal wall, a penis, and a scrotum. Jackson and Meredith teamed up to go retrieve the organs at another hospital. On their trip, Meredith shared that Richard had caught her and Andrew together at the party and that she was nervous because Richard was overseeing Andrew's first solo surgery. Jackson remembered him walking in on him and Maggie once, so he could imagine how nervous Andrew would be. The procurement went well, but when they returned, they discovered Catherine had called off the surgery because the patient had lied about his support system, which she had come to value a great deal since her cancer. Owen talked with the patient and convinced Catherine to move forward with the surgery. While operating, Jackson told Meredith that was he was constantly worrying over Catherine and how he also worried about how it affected Richard, as Meredith did. During the last part, Catherine promised Jackson she wouldn't keep it from him if she got worse. He appreciated that and she thanked him for the surgery.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nOn Jo's first day back, Jackson invited her to help him out on her project since Meredith asked him to check up on her. He brought up her having met her birth mother, but she didn't want to talk about it. He insisted and she said she shouldn't have gone looking like he told her to. He replied she went looking anyway so she must have felt like she needed to do it. Looking back, she didn't understand why because she had everything and she threw it all away for nothing. He pointed out she still had everything, but she knew Alex wasn't happy with her anymore and she was convinced talking to him about her experience would only hurt more. Jackson revealed he knew that she was drunk and, after she refused to talk any more, told her she would not be met with compassion if she ever came to work drunk again. Jackson informed Alex about what happened. Inspired by Jo, he sought out Maggie in her blue room and asked her to move in with him because he did not want to take love for granted.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie didn't accept right away because she wanted to talk it over with Meredith first. Jackson didn't understand why she needed her permission, but Maggie just wanted to clear it with her first because Meredith depended on her with the kids and she was a buffer between her and Amelia sometimes. After a conversation with [[Lucas Ripley]], she came to tell him that the only right answer was yes. She just needed him to weigh the pros and cons with her, because that was who she is and she wanted to make sure that he could accept her being her. Jackson agreed, but again invited her to go camping with him first.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\n\nThey went on their trip. He poured her coffee in the mornings and they made out in their tent. While not entirely enthusiastic, she agreed to go hiking with him so he could show her a special spot. He appreciated her doing her best and she enjoyed seeing him in his element. Their hike was cut short when she was bitten by a bug and twisted her ankle while running away from it. They made it back to the tent to take care of the swollen bite while she had decided that they should just accept what the other person liked and not try to get the other one to like it, too. They then found out that Alex had been trying to reach her for their shared patient [[Gus Carter]]. Maggie decided they needed to go, but while packing up their stuff, they received word that Teddy had gone into labor, meaning her service was no longer covered. They decided to leave their stuff behind and come back for it later, but a downpour prevented them from taking off.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nThey waited it out in their tent and took off for the car. While walking, she had trouble trusting he knew the way and freaked out when he slipped and fell into a creek, which sparked a fight between them. She blamed him for forcing her to come with while he hated how she was assigning blame to him for everything while he just wanted her to come explore something he loved. He ended up carrying her and said he only wanted her to expand, not change. He suggested she had missed out on some aspects of life while buried in books during her formative years. She fired back that they were in this situation because his privilege prevented him from learning about consequences. She said the money couldn't get them to Gus. He was offended at her calling him \"Mr. Monopoly\" and concluded she did not respect him while she realized he didn't like her for who she was.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jackson decides to head out into the fog.]]\nThey made it to the car, but they got stuck in traffic caused by thick fog covering the city. He grabbed a flashlight and headed out to explore the situation, telling her to stay in the car where she was safe and knew exactly what would happen in the near future. She watched him disappear into the fog. When he didn't return for quite some time, she went after him and called his name, but he didn't respond.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nDuring his walk, he heard [[Mari Prishna]] calling for help and found her holding onto a rope that was attached to her unconscious husband [[Jai Prishna]], who was dangling off the edge of a cliff with broken legs. Jackson took over for her and called . Maggie went to look for him. She found him right when [[Victoria Hughes]] arrived on the aid car with supplies. Together, they pulled Jai up and transported him to the hospital. After Jai and Mari were taken into the ER, Jackson and Maggie sat in the ambulance in silence. They agreed to let their tempers settle before talking about their fight. Jackson worked on both Mari and Jai with Link and they managed to save them. A week later, Jackson tried to talk to Maggie, but she was still angry at him for abandoning her in the car on an unfamiliar road in the woods, so they planned on talking later.\n\nA week later, Jai suffered from what appeared to be a stroke. While studying their scans, Maggie came in and Jackson told her that Mari had held onto Jai for so long that a tree sliced up her nerves and almost cut off her arm, only for him to end up on life support after excruciating surgeries. They knew there was something broken beyond repair in Jai that landed him there, but they had no idea what. It made Jackson wonder if Mari should have let go back at the cliff. Maggie realized he meant that their relationship had broken beyond repair and that he wanted to let go.\n\nJackson ran into Vic in the ambulance bay and thanked her for helping him back at that cliff. She stated she was just doing her job, but she appreciated hearing how Mari and Jai were doing. Jackson invited her for burgers, but she had to work. They did meet up for lunch after a week. He talked about the fat embolus syndrome that they had diagnosed Jai with. Then they both admitted they were just getting out of a serious relationship and that it wasn't a good time to start something new. The experimental protocol that the doctors had started was a success and Jai recovered without deficits. Jackson shared the good news with Vic, which Maggie witnessed. She asked him how long this thing between him and Vic had been going on. He told her they were just friends, even though it was none of her business. She agreed since they didn't like each other and therefore were not friends anymore.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after the breakup, Jackson shared a post on social media with #Freedom. Maggie was bitter because of this and mocked Victoria's intellect, stating he now got to feel superior all the time instead of dating an intellectually challenging woman. He learned Bailey had taken action to improve the residents' skills and Tom added to Jackson's dislike of him by dismissing teaching residents. Per Meredith's request, Jackson performed a biopsy of a nodule in [[Robin (Season )|Robin's]] neck. He also assured Levi he would cover for him if Bailey were to discover he had brought hospital supplies to Meredith for her street clinic, stating he was not afraid of getting in trouble if it allowed Meredith to help people. The biopsy revealed cancer, which, while treatable, faced Robin with the choice between bankruptcy and death, confirming Jackson had been right to help Meredith out. Later, he ran into Maggie and told her that she had been wrong about Vic, who was smart and brave. Maggie apologized for her mean comments but pointed out his post was spiteful, even if he hadn't meant it that way.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and Vic continued to spend more time together. They went hiking together and she impressed him with her strength by removing a fallen tree from the path by herself. Later, he ran into her after she had dropped off a patient at the ER and noticed she had a facial lac. He suggested he stitch it up, eager to show her his skills. While suturing, he countered her teasing him about being stronger than him by stating his training was about zeroing in on the smallest detail. He flirtatiously said it was his job to take care of his patients' every need. After he finished, she pulled him in and kissed. He suggested they take it slow but neither was in the mood to do that, so they continued to make out.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWhen an article was published under Meredith's name that inadvertently trashed Grey Sloan, Tom arranged for Jackson to do a pro bono surgery on a -year-old girl with a severe case of craniosynostosis in exchange for the parents allowing them to film the surgery and the family's experience to get the hospital some positive, free publicity, which he hated. Throughout the day, Jackson noticed Tom was more concerned about getting good footage for the report than putting the parents at ease, so after Jo pointed out Meredith was doing the right thing without worrying about optics, Jackson decided to do the same. He replaced Tom with Amelia and operated on the girl pro bono without filming it as he knew they were actually uncomfortable with that. During surgery, Tom burst in and tried to pull rank to step in for Amelia and bring in the camera crew. However, Jackson said he himself was the Foundation and also the majority shareholder of the hospital, pointing out that he was, in fact, Tom's boss, and forced him to leave. The surgery was pulled off without a hitch. Later, when he was checking up on the girl in post-op, Vic stopped by and admitted she was impressed by his work. They then went for dinner in the cafeteria together.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Jackson treated [[Mary Rose Hawkins-Garrett]], who suffered from xeroderma pigmentosum and had burns from apparent UV exposure, even though she maintained she hadn't been exposed. He had to disappoint Mary Rose by telling her she wouldn't get to leave in time for trick-or-treating but assured her the parade on the peds floor was great. Levi informed him there was no parade since Alex was gone so Jackson bestowed that task onto him. After surgery, Jackson again tried to get Mary Rose to admit that she had been exposed but she only said she wanted Alex, who had treated her before. Jackson then did his best Alex impression, which made her laugh. She then admitted she had been exposed when she was chasing her new cat. Jackson said this was her one pass. He used this case to point out to Andrew, who had been having trouble with Zola, that kids always have a reason for their behavior.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nWhen his mother came back into town, Maggie approached him to talk. He tried to brush her off but she insisted on talking. She told him Catherine was still unaware of their break-up. They started bickering until Maggie noticed a woman she thought had a striking resemblance to her. Jackson commented he'd have to see her scowl first.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nJackson came to support Meredith at her hearing before the medical commission. While there, he ran into Richard, who had just returned to town after Sabrina's funeral. Richard told him his family wasn't ready to see anyone from Seattle, which is why he hadn't reached out. Jackson was surprised to learn that his mother hadn't attended the funeral either. Jackson followed the hearing, which was interrupted when [[Paul Castello]] had a seizure. During the recess, Jackson found a drunk Maggie in the hotel bar beating herself up over Sabrina's death. He decided to take her home. Over wine, he asked her about Richard and Catherine but she didn't know anything about their problems. Jackson then got a text that Meredith got to keep her license. Maggie realized she hadn't helped at all but he pointed out she had helped by not testifying drunk. They laughed, which led to his admitting that he missed talking with her about their lives. They nearly kissed until he said he couldn't. She then threw him out.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine caught Jackson leaning into Vic in the ambulance bay. She introduced herself to Catherine and left on the aid car. Catherine commented on his getting cozy with the paramedic. He later found her in a conference room and clarified that he wasn't cheating as he and Maggie had broken up months ago. He promised her it wouldn't affect her marriage but Catherine wasn't sure how long he'd still have to worry about that. She told him about Gemma. Jackson likened it to her past with Tom but she pointed out she didn't have a history of cheating. Jackson tried to reassure her and pointed out that she had a habit of retreating when she had an idea in her head that she didn't like. When she said they hadn't spoken in weeks, he asked if they hadn't spoken or if she just hadn't listened. He met up with her again later at the bar after she went to see Richard. She downed an entire gin and tonic when she entered the bar and ordered three more. She told him that he had Gemma in his office and that an intern called Gemma Richard's wife. Jackson tried to calm her down and said it sounded more like a miscommunication, also adding that those problems began when she stood back and let Bailey fire him. She didn't like his defending Richard and brought up his new girlfriend. Jackson pointed out it wasn't relevant to her business but she disagreed since he had chosen to date her husband's daughter. He wasn't willing to be held responsible for both her and his own relationships. Jackson was still at the bar when a car suddenly crashed into it.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter working the frontlines during the COVID- pandemic, Jackson was confronted with severe racial inequity in medicine. He began to wonder why the Foundation had not done more and collaborated with [[Alma Ortiz]] to come up with ideas to help the underprivileged citizens of Seattle. When he confronted Catherine about her neglecting his pitches, she pointed out all the work they had accomplished through the Foundation and said change takes time. He was not satisfied and began pondering possibilities to make serious changes. He got the idea to take over the Foundation from his mother and move to Boston, leaving behind his life and surgical career. He took a sudden leave of absence and sought out his father to see if walking away from his life was the right path for him. His father reinforced his plan. Jackson drove home to tell his mother that he was taking over the Foundation and then went to see April and ask her to move her family to Boston with him since he could not leave Harriet behind, like his father had left him. April was not supportive of his plan since he was uprooting his whole life and asked her to do the same over something that he had actively rejected for as long as she had known him. However, after his passionate speeches about his ideas, she agreed to make the move with him and revealed that she and Matthew had split up during the pandemic. They were excited for new horizons and started planning their move to Boston.\n\n\nAs a child, Jackson often listened to stories about his grandfather, [[Harper Avery]], and ever since then, he has always wanted to be a surgeon. Jackson is very forward, often saying what's on his mind even if it hurts someone's feelings. He is also intelligent, kind, and very protective of the people he cares about like his mother, [[Catherine Fox]], and his best friend and later wife, [[April Kepner]].\n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nWhen Jackson first arrived at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], he developed a small crush on [[Cristina Yang]] and kissed her while inebriated at a party. However, Cristina did not return any intimate feelings towards him. Instead, she broke the kiss immediately and told him that it never happened.\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nJackson and [[Lexie Grey]] developed a relationship after [[Mark Sloan]] bribed Jackson with surgery in exchange for information on how Lexie was doing. Jackson got the information he wanted but didn't tell Mark about it because he'd developed feelings for Lexie and wanted to respect her privacy. Mark did, however, still allow Jackson to perform the surgery he was promised. Lexie and Jackson eventually became a couple, sleeping together all over the hospital and Meredith's house, very much to April's dismay. They attended Callie and Arizona's wedding together.<ref>[[White Wedding]], x</ref> However, when Jackson's mother came to town, Jackson sent Lexie to go visit her sister Molly in fear that his mother would somehow ruin their relationship.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref> Throughout their relationship, Lexie's ex-boyfriend and mentor to Jackson, [[Mark Sloan]] was still in love with Lexie and was uneasy seeing the two together. Lexie and Jackson broke up when Jackson realized that Lexie was still in love with Mark.\n\n[[Mara Keaton]]\nWhen Catherine Avery came to SGMW for a bladder transplant, she brought along Mara Keaton, a Urology fellow at [[Massachusetts General Hospital|Mass Gen]]. Catherine asked Jackson to tour Mara around the hospital, which made him suspect that his mother was pushing him into a relationship with her. Mara felt that Catherine could be really annoying also. He encouraged Mara to stand up to his mother. Mara did stand up to her, but Catherine was not mad at Mara. Jackson was pleased with what Mara had done and after that, he slept with her in the on-call room.<ref>[[One Step Too Far]], x</ref>\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nOn the night before his [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]], Jackson and [[April Kepner]] engage in a bar fight and later have sex. Jackson was leery at first, due to the fact that April was a virgin, but she promised him it was okay and she wanted to do it. Later, however, April told Jackson that the reason she had been a virgin so long is that she was celibate. She was completely heartbroken and distraught at what happened between them, which caused Jackson to feel extremely guilty. They had another sexual encounter in the men\us room during a break from their\uamedical board exams, which helped both Jackson and April calm down.<ref>[[Let the Bad Times Roll]], x</ref> However, it was too late for April and she failed. When she was let go from the hospital, Jackson comforted her, but April perceived it as him pitying her and told him to leave her alone.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson accepted the job at Tulane, he told April he felt sick at the thought of leaving her behind. He postponed his move, however, when he heard about the plane crash. When [[Mark Sloan]] showed signs of recovery, April told Jackson the only reason she stayed was to make sure Mark was okay, and now that he was, she would be leaving for home.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen April was rehired by [[Owen Hunt]], she told Jackson she was in the process of revirginizing. Although Jackson didn't approve because he felt she was trying to pretend they never happened, he promised to help in any way that he could. However, they couldn't resist each other and continued their relationship until finally breaking it off. The two went their separate ways, which culminated in them seeing other people.\n\nDuring a massive storm near the hospital, a bus flipped and the doctors had to rush in and evacuate as many people as possible. The doctors believed they got to everyone, but Jackson stayed behind because he noticed a small pink shoe. When April noticed Jackson wasn't with them, she began to panic and rushed back towards the bus as it lay there ablaze. Suddenly, the bus exploded. Thinking Jackson was in the explosion, April became hysterical. When he emerged from the fire with a small child, she ran to hug him but was stopped by Matthew.[[File:Jacksons_alive.png|thumb|April Kepner realizes Jackson is alive.]]\n\nWhen Jackson was being treated by [[Callie Torres|Callie]] for his injuries, April walked in furious, screaming at him for almost dying, but was quickly removed. Thinking she had lost Jackson made her realize her true feelings for him. When everyone calmed down, she went back in to see him. She told him that she wanted him, which Jackson quickly rebuffed by telling her she was marrying [[Matthew Taylor|Matthew]]\uasoon. April then told Jackson to give her a reason not to.\n\nAlthough Jackson may have still had feelings for April, he did not give her a reason to leave Matthew. Instead, he exploded at April, telling her the only reason she wanted him was because he had moved on. This put a small strain on their friendship, but they still spoke occasionally. April even admitted that Jackson set her straight and she was happy to be getting married to Matthew.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the time came for April to send out wedding invitations, she purposely left out Jackson's name. She said she did this because she feared it would upset Matthew. Instead, she invited Stephanie, hoping she would bring Jackson as her guest. After speaking with Matthew and April, Jackson realizes that April truly wants him to be at her wedding so he decides to go and they share a brief hug, re-establishing their friendship.\n\nDuring the ceremony, however, Jackson apologized to\ua[[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]]\uabefore telling April that he loves her and that he always has loved her in front of the entire crowd.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref> It is later revealed that April chose Jackson and decided to marry him.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\nAfter working on [[Jill Kasliner]], Jackson and April fought about how they would raise their children. April walked out and ended up staying with [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] for a few days. She came back to retrieve her iPod and told Jackson that they couldn't table the discussion about how they'll raise their children any longer because she's pregnant.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref> They later discover that their unborn son has Osteogenesis Imperfecta type  and decide to induce labor at  weeks. Shortly after giving birth and holding their son, Samuel Norbert, he died in their arms.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Samuel, April left Jackson to go overseas with Owen to join the Army as a trauma surgeon. She was originally supposed to be gone for only three months but ended up staying away for a whole year.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nApril came back and things between them were rocky because Jackson felt like he had been abandoned by April during the time he needed her most. When April decided to take another tour, Jackson said that if she did, he wouldn't wait for her, although he said he loves her.\n\nApril came back from her second tour and Jackson told her to move out of their apartment. She refused because they were married and she didn't want to give that up. He eventually left and stayed with Bailey and Ben for a while. He told April he wanted a divorce and after some sexual encounters and four weeks of marriage counseling, April was served with divorce papers in the middle of the emergency room.<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref>\n\nRight before reluctantly signing the divorce papers, April discovered she was pregnant for a second time, yet chose to not inform Jackson and proceeded with signing the papers. Even after the divorce, she continued to keep her pregnancy a secret from Jackson and everyone else (with the exception of Arizona and Alex) until Arizona took the liberty in telling Jackson herself.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref> Jackson was very upset with April for lying to him and having to hear the news from someone else, but he was particularly bothered by the fact that April knew even before they signed the divorce papers, allowing their divorce to be finalized while she was withholding this important information. April confessed that she decided not to tell him because she knew he would change his mind about the divorce and she didn't want him to stay with her just for the baby.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nLater, she hooked up with Jackson while they were in Montana to work on a case.<ref>[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]], x</ref>\n\n[[Stephanie Edwards]]\nJackson started a relationship with the new intern, Stephanie, after hooking up in a car during Bailey's wedding, but he claimed it was purely sexual and only for fun. However, Stephanie seemed to think their relationship was more serious than that, stating that she would follow him if he were to find a job at a different hospital.\n\nJackson introduced Stephanie to his mother and the couple became more serious than they were.\n\nStephanie confronted Jackson about any residual feelings between him and April, which he denied.\n\nJackson indirectly broke up with Stephanie at April's wedding, telling her\ua\"I'm sorry,\" before standing up, interrupting April's wedding, and professing his love for her.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n[[Priya]]\nJackson briefly dated a woman called Priya, a human rights lawyer who travels a lot. When Jackson was invited to Maggie's game night, he decided to bring Priya. They played and had fun, but the night was abruptly ended when Clive's wife showed up, shocking everyone. After Clive and his wife left, Jackson called the night and took Priya home. He decided then to end things with her because of his feelings for Maggie.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nMaggie and Jackson began developing romantic feelings for each other during her mom's treatment for breast cancer at Grey Sloan Memorial. The two developed a stronger friendship after her mom's passing. Her mom, Diane, left Jackson in possession of pictures she wanted Maggie to have. April pointed out during the fire at the hospital that Jackson had feelings for Maggie, and Maggie\uahad feelings for him too. Maggie later confronted Jackson, quickly calling such suggestions, \"silly.\" But soon after, Jackson and Maggie started growing closer to each other.\n\nShe then later declined\uahis offer for a drink, citing that his mom and her biological father, Richard,\uaare married and that it's complicated. However, after discovering that Maggie's boyfriend Clive was married,\uaJackson ended his time with [[Priya]], unable to deny his feelings for Maggie. Jackson returned to Meredith's house, confessing his attraction\uafor Maggie and the two shared their first kiss, beginning a romantic relationship.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and Maggie's relationship had been going strong, with them having conversations about Jackson's loss and pain and Maggie's difficulty in opening up to him.\uaMaggie comforted Jackson during his mom's cancer treatment, while he encouraged her to be more open in their relationship. After they dated for a while, Jackson asked Maggie to move in with him, and she agreed.\n\nWhile they were camping, Maggie got stung by something, causing her to freak out and injure herself. After a bit of arguing about being in the woods, Jackson tried to explain that he didn't want Maggie to change just to grow and that Maggie missed out on some aspects of life due to her being so young when she graduated everything. Maggie called Jackson privileged and said that Jackson's family is so rich that he couldn't possibly know what consequences were.t, After this fight Jackson broke things off, saying their relationship was broken beyond repair.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n[[Victoria Hughes]]\nVic met Jackson when she responded to a call and found him holding [[Jai Prishna]], who was dangling from a rope over a cliff. She helped him wench Jai up to safety. Later, when she was at the hospital to drop off another patient, he asked her to go get burgers, but she said maybe another time. Later, they had lunch together in the park and talked about Jai. She told him about Lucas dying and he told her about his recent breakup with Maggie. They both agreed that it wasn't a great time for either of them to start a new relationship. Despite this, they continued to see each other, though it remained mostly platonic.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To|Nothing Left To Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Catherine Fox]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jackson & his mother, Catherine.]]\nJackson perceives his mother as a lunatic, constantly butting in on his personal life, mostly romantic and professional life, which he was especially annoyed at during his residency.\n\nWhen Catherine came to Seattle Grace Mercy West to perform the country's first penile transplant, she grilled him on his romantic life and criticized his girlfriend.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith and Jackson's friendship started when she discovered that he was the grandson of Harper Avery and son of famed urologist Catherine Avery. Familiar with the pressure of successful surgeon parents, she defended him when others teased him about it, and when he struggled to embrace or hide his legacy. They found more common ground when Catherine and Richard started dating and got married as Richard became a father figure in Jackson's life like he had been for Meredith.\n\nTheir friendship includes regularly teasing one another, such as her being protective of her at-the-time boyfriend [[Andrew DeLuca]]. She confided in Jackson that she had a bad feeling about Andrew's research with her father, while she did her best to be supportive of him. When he started dating Maggie, Meredith warned him not to cheat on her.\n\n[[Atticus Lincoln]]\nJackson befriended Link after working a few cases together. They developed a special handshake between them.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nJackson and Jo developed a friendship mainly after she got married to Alex. During a particular surgery, Jo was venting about Alex's mother pushing her to start thinking about having kids. In her rant, she called kids monsters, which offended Jackson. Jo later apologized to him and asked if the cute things outweigh the terror kids and cause. Jackson admitted to her that kids could be monsters, but they also give you the feeling that everything's right. He told her kids can ruin lives but also give you a reason to live when life tries to ruin you.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jo started thinking about finding her parents, Jackson warned her it could go badly as his finding his own father only caused him more pain.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Sloan|Mark]] gives Jackson a pep talk before his [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical boards]].]]\nDuring Jackson's relationship with Lexie, he and [[Mark Sloan]] developed a mentor/student relationship, which continues to grow even after Lexie and Jackson split. Mark often referred to them as the \"Plastics Posse\" - much to Jackson's embarrassment. They later became inseparable and were often teased about their bromance by the other doctors. After Mark's tragic death, Jackson promised him that the \"Plastics Posse\" would live on.\n\n\nJackson was initially a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Mercy West Medical Center]], until the merger with [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]]. Upon his transfer to Seattle Grace, Jackson has rotated over the services of several surgical departments, such as [[neurosurgery]], [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]], and [[Plastic Surgery|plastics]]. Jackson took a shine to Plastics and that is now his specialty.\n\nJackson is one of four doctors to pass their [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]], and he is currently employed at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] following the death of [[Mark Sloan]]. When the hospital was reorganized as [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and instituted a new board, Jackson became the de facto board chairman as he is the board representative for the Harper Avery Foundation, the majority shareholder of the hospital.\n\nSometime in Jackson's [[Timeline#Grey's Anatomy Season |third-year]] as an attending, he was promoted to the department head of plastic surgery.\n\n\n*Jackson originally declared [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]] as his specialty during his [[Internship|intern year]].<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref>\n*Jackson loses his composure and gets nervous when on camera.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: Message of Hope]]</ref> A similar event happened during his high school graduation.\n*He has nightmares, especially after the shooting at Seattle Grace.\n*He had a lucky pencil before it was broken during his [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]].\n*Jackson played baseball in high school and football in college.\n*Jackson is pro-choice.\n*Jackson lost his virginity when he was  to Sarah Richardson and Penny Cairo at his junior prom at the same time.

When they saw George cleaning out his locker, they went to check out the cafeteria. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nOn her first day as an intern, she was assigned to [[Alex Karev]], who took them on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nAlex was examining [[Brian Kristler]] in the ER when he noticed that he smelled like meth. Laura brought Alex Brian's films, which showed no acute injury, so Alex told Laura to run a tox screen, which showed meth use. He had her stay with [[Dave Kristler]], telling her not to leave him alone with the baby. ''(\"[[Love/Addiction]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns worked on Patient X (actually Izzie using her own scans and labs) and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. Laura got in trouble with Izzie for making fun of the patient. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nShe attended Alex and Izzie's wedding. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program.

She had surgery to repair it and was given ten days' worth of opioids for the pain. She ended up addicted to them and moved on to other drugs when they ran out.\n\n\nBetty got pregnant by a drug dealer and gave birth to [[Leo Hunt|Leo]]. At some point after his birth, he was put into foster care and went to live with [[Owen Hunt]].\n\n\nWhen Leo got his six-month well-baby checkup, Betty was told she could come and she did. While he was getting a shot, Betty stepped out of the room and talked to Amelia, who offered to buy her breakfast. While they were eating, Betty told Amelia what had happened that led to her life being how it was. In response, Amelia decided to take Betty in and help her get and stay clean. When Betty showed up to come home with her, Amelia laid out the rules for her and then they went home with Owen and Leo. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\n\nAmelia helped Betty get through her detox, which involved lots of vomiting. Betty was angry with Amelia and took the withdrawal out on her, which Amelia said was fine. Amelia became worried when Betty was spending a long time in the bathroom, she went to check on her and found that Betty had left out the window. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")''\n\n\nBetty came back to Owen's house. She said she'd been clean for six days and missed Leo. Amelia took her to work and kept Betty in her sight all day. Betty later confessed that she'd been too high to miss Leo and came back because she got cold, which Amelia already knew. She then took Betty to a meeting. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\nThe day of Alex and Jo's wedding was the day Betty got her -day chip from AA. Neither of her parents came to the ceremony despite Amelia inviting them. Betty then went to the wedding with Owen and Amelia. After the wedding planner ended up having an allergic reaction to shrimp and was sent to the hospital, the wedding party and guests then boarded a ferry, where Alex and Jo were married by Meredith. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the wedding, she continued to live with Owen, Amelia, and Leo and the four of them settled into a rhythm. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\n\nAmelia became upset and fought with Betty when she believed Betty was doing drugs and lying about it. She took Betty to work with her for a drug test, but still wasn't sure what she should do. Amelia then talked to Owen's mother about how to be a good parent to Betty. She went back to Betty, who admitted to having smoked weed. Amelia reminded her that drug addicts can't do that, because if you smoke weed, you might forget not to do heroin. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Amelia read a text from Betty's phone about her skipping class, Amelia convinced Owen to wait with her outside Betty's school to see if she would leave during the day. When they saw Betty leaving with two friends, Owen got their attention and waved, which encouraged them to go back to school. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\n\nSoon after, Amelia dropped Betty off at school one morning and then the school called and told her Betty hadn't come to school that day. Amelia came back to Owen's to check if Betty was there, but she wasn't, so she, Owen, and Teddy spread out to look for her, but at the end of the day, she was still missing. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the wind storm, Betty came into the ER with a cut on her head. She openly admitted to Amelia that she was high and said she really did want to get better. Amelia was angry with her, but came to the ER, hugged her, and told her to come back always. She also decided to become Betty's foster mom officially. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nWhen Richard found Betty wandering the hospital, he said that he fights cravings by helping people and invited her to help him treat patients. When she started talking about staying clean and getting her life back on track, he advised her not to think she was cured just because she was making good progress. Later, he found her searching cabinets for drugs. He told her they were kept in a locked cabinet. Amelia later talked to Betty and said she needed to be ready to accept Amelia's help and help herself and to get her to that point, Amelia found her a bed at a rehab facility. Betty agreed to have Amelia drive her there. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Owen and Amelia went to visit Betty in rehab, Betty said that one of the steps in rehab is to apologize and tell the truth. Betty said that she had been lying to Owen and Amelia all along and that her real name is Britney. Betty said she ran away when she got pregnant with Leo because she was afraid her parents would take Leo from her. ''(\"[[Girlfriend in a Coma]]\")''\n\n\nAfter telling Amelia the truth, Betty ran away from rehab after calling her parents to tell them where she was. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\n\nBetty and her boyfriend, [[Linus]], took meth and then went to the park, where they got opioids. They both overdosed and were taken to the hospital, where they were directed to the clinic because they both seemed stable. Once she realized where she was, Betty asked Linus to get their clothes so they could leave, but then she suddenly started having chest pains. She was moved to the hospital, where they found an aortic dissection. She was rushed into surgery. After a difficult operation, Betty's parents were told she'd be okay. She was stable and awake afterward, but unaware that Linus had died while she was in surgery. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\n\nTwo weeks after her heart surgery, Betty prepared to leave town to go home with her parents and Leo. She refused to say goodbye to Amelia before they left. Later, they returned to give Leo back to Owen, saying Betty wanted to be a kid and be able to make mistakes and live her life, which she couldn't do if she had to be Leo's mom. ''(\"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe became romantically involved with [[Linus]] while they were in rehab together. She confided in him that she worried that when people learned her drug dealer had gotten her pregnant at fifteen that no one would love her and he promised to love her forever. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\n\nShe has a son named Leo who was in foster care and later adopted by [[Owen Hunt]].\n\n\nShe has friends named Rachel and Eileen, whom Amelia says seem like nice girls.

In response, she started interning at a local medical non-profit. She also traveled to Europe, South America, and Africa, where she saw a kid in Zimbabwe wake up after a month in a coma. After a year, she reapplied to medical school and got in. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nIn her first year, Sydney was responsible for the death of a young patient. He came in with a fever, nausea, and stomach pain. She diagnosed gastroenteritis and sent him home. He came back a few days later with a ruptured appendix and died in surgery. She had a breakdown, so she was given time off, and when she returned, she put a smile on her face and made everyone believe that she was all right. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")'' ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\nAs an intern, she was labelled \"[[]]\", much like George. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] was on maternity leave, Sydney took over overseeing her residents. She clashed with [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], who found Sydney's positive attitude unbearable. Cristina, at one point, even thought she was purposefully killing a patient because Sydney took a risky approach to treat necrotizing fasciitis in [[Claire Solomon|an active young woman]]. However, her approach worked and she believed Claire would be okay after a few sessions in a hyperbaric chamber. Cristina later apologized to Sydney for overstepping. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nShe attended the [[Hospital Prom]], where she got sick off spike punch. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny]] died, Sydney was assigned as [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie's]] peer counselor. Izzie was initially reticent, unwilling to open up to Sydney, but once Sydney confessed her own failings, Izzie was able to slightly open up. Sydney was compassionate when Izzie said that it \"scared [her] too much\" to discuss what had happened. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\n\nSydney helped out when the interns were being taught triage skills, pretending to be a patient that Izzie was treating. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the ferry crash, Sydney tended to patients in the clinic. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\nSeeing that Alex was stressed, she offered him the chance to sit for a minute or get a hug. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nShe spoke to the family members, saying she knew it was frustrating, but asking them to donate blood if they could. She later told Bailey that she heard what Bailey did for Meredith and said she was great competition for Chief Resident. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nBecause Bailey was busy with [[Lawrence Jennings]], Sydney was called to oversee the clinic for a day. She wanted to improve patient satisfaction, so she ordered Izzie to do nasal lavage on a patient she thought had a cold. ''(\"[[Desire]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith brought Ellis's ashes to work on Halloween, Sydney told her that in tribal culture, a person trying to cleanse the past cuts off his or her own hair and buries it. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n\nSydney went on a date with Derek at [[Emerald City Bar]]. She got paged during their date and Mark came up and pointed out how poorly the date was going.

After the date, however, Sydney informed Derek that he wasn't ready for the kind of relationship she needed (much to Derek's relief, as he was going to let her down gently anyway), but they agreed not to let their relationship affect their work life. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nShe has a friend named Karen who works at a restaurant in downtown Seattle. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nShe served as [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie's]] peer counselor and revealed that her perky persona actually originated from a nervous breakdown she suffered after losing a patient of her own.\n\n\nDr. Sydney Heron is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She was in the same class year as [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] and was in the race to be [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]]. In order to better her position, she mastered several complex surgical procedures. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\nUnfortunately, she lost out to [[Callie Torres|Callie]], who was then replaced by Bailey.\n\nDespite her excesses, Sydney has proven herself to be a competent surgeon. For example, she successfully saved the leg of a patient with Necrotizing Fasciitis, assertively defending her decision when challenged by Preston Burke.

''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")'' When she learned that she was, she told Link and they celebrated their impending parenthood. ''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\nHer pregnancy continued until Amelia went to an appointment at what she believed to be her th week and learned that she was actually  weeks pregnant, injecting doubt into the paternity. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")'' She had a paternity test done and when Link came to her and said he didn't care if he was the father or not, he still wanted to be with her, she told him that he was the father. ''(\"[[Life on Mars?]]\")''\n\nLate in her pregnancy, Amelia had to leave a surgery abruptly because she believed she was in labor. She was surprised to learn that she wasn't and the contractions were just Braxton Hicks. ''(\"[[Sing It Again]]\")''\n\n\nWhile working on Richard's case, Amelia quickly said she needed Tom to take over and then revealed that her water had just broken. She walked to OB, where Carina examined her and said she was five centimeters dilated. She admitted she'd been having contractions all day, but believed they were Braxton Hicks again, so she ignored them. Carina confirmed that she was actually in active labor and monitored her progress. When she was at six centimeters, Link was called away to operate on Richard's hip. While he was gone, Bailey took over coaching and when the time came for Amelia to push, she sat herself behind Amelia's back to help her [[As We Know It|as George had done for her]]. When Link came into the room later, he met his son. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\nAfter his birth, his parents struggled to pick a name for him. His aunt [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] suggested they name him Tony, which his Dad was not a fan of. The considered several different names before eventually deciding on Scout. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, Scout was looked after by his parents, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], and Meredith and spent time with his cousins Zola, Bailey, and Ellis. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")'' During this time, his Dad frequently played guitar for him and his cousins. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nScout went to [[James Shulman]] for his one-year checkup, where he weighed  pounds and was  inches long. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nWhen his parents split up over conflicting desires regarding marriage, Scout began staying at [[Jo's Penthouse]] with his father when he was with him. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Link came to drop Scout off at Meredith's house to spend the day with Amelia, but when he learned Amelia was there alone with the kids, he stayed for the day, saying he didn't want Scout to have to split his holidays like he did as a child. After dinner, Link had a dance party with all four kids. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\n\nScout went with Link, Jo, and Luna to a park for fairytale theater. While they were watching the show, one of the actors, [[Jeremy (Today Was a Fairytale)|Jeremy]], had a sudden cardiac episode and fell onto the stage, injuring himself. Jo and Link immediately jumped in to help. When the ambulance arrived, Link rode to the hospital with Jeremy while Jo took Scout and Luna with her. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith held a dinner party at her house so that everyone could get to know Nick better, Link brought Scout. Scout was fussy and Amelia spent a while trying to get him to sleep. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nOn Halloween, Scout went trick or treating with his cousins. He dressed as an elephant. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\n\nScout had an accident at daycare. The daycare had already used his backup clothes and they hadn't been replaced, so they tried to call his parents. Both of them were in surgery, so they called his cousin, [[Lucas Adams]], to bring him clothes, which he did.

Meredith assumed Derek was cheating on her, but it was just his sister, Nancy. Meredith left before Derek could explain.\n\nShe came to Seattle to check up on him since he'd skipped the last few family holidays.

Nancy invited Amelia and Link, whom she thought was Amelia's husband, Owen, to dinner. Amelia tried to decline, saying they were leaving, but Nancy overheard them talking about being there another day at least and invited her to dinner again. Amelia begged Link to go with her and taught him all about Owen so he could play the role. When they arrived at Nancy's house, Amelia was surprised to see that Kathleen was also there. After a tense, but not overwhelming time, Carolyn arrived and Kathleen revealed that she had mentioned it to her. Carolyn, who had met Owen before when she visited Derek, exposed the lie and the dinner quickly ended.

''(\"[[Tell Me Sweet Little Lies]]\")''\n\n\nWhile driving home from work, she suddenly veered off the road and into a ditch. Debbie realized that she had fallen asleep at the wheel, due to her exhaustion from the nurses being understaffed. Debbie then said that from that incident she knew it was time to take a stand. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the understaffing pushed them to the breaking point, the second-shift nurses did a sick out and Debbie delivered official notice to Richard that they were going on strike in ten days. ''(\"[[Tell Me Sweet Little Lies]]\")''\n\nAt :, the last minute of her last shift pre-strike, she locked herself in the bathroom stall, allowed herself to hyperventilate for  seconds, and then went into the OR and gave Richard the final notice about the strike. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\nWhile walking the picket line, Debbie, along with Olivia and Tyler, asked George to go in to check on their patients. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\nDuring her lunch break, Cristina pelted the nurses with half a dozen tuna sandwiches. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")'' Later that evening, at Joe's bar, the nurses retaliated by pouring a drink on Cristina's lap. She then began to fight with the nurses, calling one of them a soccer mom, but Meredith diffused it and dragged Cristina out of the bar. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nWhen there was a bomb in [[James Carlson|a patient's]] chest cavity, Debbie informed the Chief when the Bomb Squad arrived to help after a bomb threat. ''(\"[[It's the End of the World]]\")'' She also later provided the hospital blueprints, which showed that the bomb was directly over the hospital's main oxygen line. ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Debbie was walking through the tunnels, she was cornered by [[Callie Torres]], who asked her who George's friends were, where he lived, whether or not Debbie had worked with him much, how he was with patients and doctors, his pet peeves, and if he had a girlfriend. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Shawn Beglight]] came into the hospital with a head injury, Debbie was one of his nurses. She assisted the doctors when they had to drill a burr hole in his hospital room and then [[Rick Beglight|Rick]], Shawn's father, threw up on her. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Steve Mostow]]\nDebbie considered pursuing a romantic relationship with [[Steve Mostow|Steve]] after he passed out in her car the week before Halloween. On the night of Halloween, they met up at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's bar]].\n\n[[Dr. Taylor]]\nShe dated [[Dr. Taylor]] for a time. They bonded over doing crosswords together in the OR and he eventually used a crossword joke to ask her out on a date. Things broke off between them because she didn't like that he didn't like to do anything that didn't involve alcohol. After they split, she kept being drawn to him, even though she knew it was a bad idea. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, her uncle Pete passed away. He was a nurse and was an activist for Equal Male Nursing Opportunities. Debbie says that he was a man ahead of his time. Her aunt Lucy, who was also a nurse, made rice krispie stuffing and says that Pete ate too much of it. In addition to Pete and Lucy being nurses, Debbie's sister Val, all her cousins, and her great-grandmother, Byrd were all nurses as well. Debbie said that her cousin Betty had a good sense of humor but had low self-esteem. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\nHer clique is [[Tyler Christian|Tyler]], [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]], and Liz.\n\n\nShe and Joe are best friends. They met at the bar, and Debbie recalls that he was pouring her tequila, but they knew they would be friends on the day of the first annual Emerald City Darts Tournament. When it was time to play, Joe needed a partner after his flaked on him, and Debbie volunteered to be his partner. Her dart skills brought her and Joe up to semifinals, where they lost. Joe congratulated Debbie on her dart skills and she thanked him for taking her mind off work. While munching on peanuts, they began to gossip about the people they both knew. Debbie then had the revelation that they shared a connection to almost every person at Seattle Grace; Debbie saw them at work, and Joe saw them after work. Debbie said that it was like \"comparing notes\". They have been best friends ever since. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n[[Elizabeth Fallon]]\nShe was good friends with Elizabeth while she worked at the hospital. When she died, Debbie was in the room and she said it was a strangely serene moment. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n[[Yvonne]]\nYvonne and Debbie hit it off while [[Mary]] was being treated. Debbie even managed to get them some jello cups, despite the cafeteria being closed. When Yvonne died due to internal bleeding, Debbie said that it hit her hard since she looked fine but was more damaged then most of the patients in the room. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nAfter Cristina stole a patient from the psych ward and dismissed Debbie rudely after asking for paperwork on the patient, she paged her constantly for rectal exams and other disgusting cases. At the end of the day, Cristina went to Bailey, assuming that it was her, and asked why she was paged for all those cases, but Bailey said that she had no idea what she was talking about. Debbie then says to Cristina that if she had shown a little respect, she could've saved herself a ''very long day''.\n\nDuring the nurses' strike, she pelted the nurses with half a dozen tuna sandwiches. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")'' At Joe's bar, the nurses retaliated by pouring a drink on Cristina's lap. She then began to get into a fight with the nurses, calling one a soccer mom, but [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] dragged Cristina out of the bar before it could happen. ''(\"[[Break on Through]])''\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nAfter he refused to cross the picket line, Debbie said that she had a newfound respect for George. Debbie and a few other nurses sent George into the hospital so that they could receive reports on their patients. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nShe has a good professional relationship with Richard. He says she is like family and also says that while Adele keeps him in check at home, Debbie is the one that keeps him in line at work. She informs Adele of what he is doing at the hospital and calls her if Richard is stuck in surgery and won't make it home for dinner. Debbie also reminds him about birthdays, holidays, and wedding anniversaries. For his th birthday, Debbie threw a surprise party at the hospital and Richard says he will never forget it. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she started at Seattle Grace, she was intimidated by [[Ellis Grey]] and says she was the Cristina Yang of her class. Debbie says that Ellis is still is one of the most skilled doctors she ever worked with. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\nShe worked at Seattle Grace as a nurse from the time of Ellis Grey and remained until at least [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] second year of residency. She was a large part of the nurses' strike when the hospital was understaffed. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\nBefore working at Seattle Grace, she worked at County Hospital.

On his first day, he did a liver transplant on [[Lisa Collis]], a four month old with biliary atresia. He was unable to close because of the swelling. [[Alex Karev]] had the idea to use a sterilized ping pong ball to hold the place, which was safer than a sponge because there was little risk for infection and her liver would just grow around it. Alex presented the idea to Stark, who rejected it, saying that he'd asked Alex to take care of his post-ops and not \"play with balls!\" However, Alex later found out that Stark had taken Lisa into surgery and was claiming credit for the idea. The surgery was successful. ''(\"[[Something's Gotta Give]]\")''\n\n\nStark left [[Meredith Grey]] in charge of his patients overnight while he went out. When [[Drew McNeil]] had severe post-op pain, Meredith paged him, but he quickly dismissed the pain as gas and left. When a CT revealed a perforated ulcer, Meredith paged Stark again, but he didn't answer his pages, so they took Drew into surgery without him. When he found out what they had done, he yelled at them, saying he would have taken the heat if something had gone wrong. ''(\"[[Slow Night, So Long]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Jared Swork]] opened fire on Pacific College, he shot Kelly Keck, a  year old. Stark took her into surgery. Because of her injuries, he believed amputating her leg was the safest option. However, [[Alex Karev]] believed that [[Callie Torres]] could save the leg, so he called to [[Arizona Robbins]], who was watching from the gallery, for support. She had Alex physically stop Stark while she went to get operating privileges and Callie to save the leg. When she returned and took over, Stark was shocked and left the OR in disbelief. He complained to Webber about it, but Webber told him to go save a life. When the doctors later all started to laugh after learning no one had died in the shooting, he was incredulous and declared that he hated the hospital. ''(\"[[Disarm]]\")''\n\n\nStark started to get close with April after they worked on the case of [[Kyle Baker]], a ten year old with a cystic hygroma that was nearly cutting off his airway. Stark wanted to call child protective services on the parents because they let it get so bad, but April figured out a compromise, which involved Kyle coming in regularly for exams, which April agreed to do personally. He later invited her to have dinner with him. After thinking about it, she accepted. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\nHe continued to work closely with April as they socialized outside of work. This came to a head when he invited her to come watch a movie at his house and her fellow residents convinced her that he was expecting sex. She panicked and cancelled their date. He realized what was happening and they ended things because she thought of him as a friend and he didn't want to be just her friend. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\nAfter that conversation, he started to ignore her and insisted that she call him Dr. Stark instead of Robert. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]] was born extremely prematurely, Callie was unable to see her. Cristina went to Stark to ask about it, but he said that Sofia wasn't stable enough to move, so he forced her to wait.\n\nBecause of her prematurity, Sofia's PDA hadn't closed by the time she was five weeks old. Despite [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona's]] attempts to get another pediatric surgeon to operate, she was unable to find one. Stark therefore operated and allowed Arizona to be in the OR to watch. However, Arizona was unable to handle it when Sofia started to bleed out. After Arizona left the OR suddenly, Stark was able to save her and finish the surgery. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Alex had the idea to bring several African patients to Seattle to have surgery, he made a presentation to Stark in order to get funding to pay for the project. However, Stark refused. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the African children started arriving in Seattle for their surgeries, he worked on the case of [[Asha]] with April and Owen. He became frustrated when April focused more on Asha and how scared she was than the medicine. He later found her making porridge in the hopes that she'd be able to get Asha to eat something. He scolded her for it, but later endorsed her as a potential Chief Resident to Owen. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nAfter working together on [[Kyle Baker]], Stark was impressed that April had convinced him to change his mind and asked her out on a date as a result. She took some time to think about it, but accepted his invitation. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\nThey had several outings together when one time, April said she'd have to cancel because she wasn't sure when she'd get out of the hospital, so he suggested that she just come to his house, where they'd watch a movie and have dinner. When the other residents convinced her he wanted to have sex with her, she backed out. He figured out that she wanted to break things off with her, citing the age difference. She clarified that she thought of them as more like friends, but he said he didn't want her to be just his friend. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\nAfter that conversation, he started to ignore her. When she said she wished other people could get to know the Robert she knew, he simply said that she should call him Dr. Stark. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\nWhile working on [[Asha]], April confronted Stark about ignoring her, but he insisted that he was treating her just like any other resident. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\n\nUnder contract for a year, Stark served as the department [[Attending#Department Head|head]] even after Robbins returned. Described as a lazy doctor and a complacent and self-satisfied attending, Stark represented the antithesis of attending surgeons commonly employed at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. Stark had an antagonistic disposition with most of the hospital staff.\n\nUpon his arrival, he formed a negative relationship with [[Alex Karev]] when he refused to consider using Alex's idea for a liver transplant. Alex later discovered Stark used the idea, but said it was his own. This negative relationship was reinforced when Stark insisted on amputating a teenage girl's leg unnecessarily. Karev body blocked Stark from the leg while [[Arizona Robbins]] went to get her privileges reinstated. When she returned, she kicked Stark out of the OR, and she and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] were able to save the leg. This showed that he values being right and doing things his way over helping a child. He is also not very open to suggestions.\n\nDespite his negative qualities, Stark proved to be a competent surgeon when he [[It's a Long Way Back|performed life-saving surgery]] on [[Callie Torres|Callie]], [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], and [[Mark Sloan|Mark's]] baby, [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] after her PDA failed to close. Arizona, who had initially considered other surgeons for the job, expressed her gratitude to him regardless of their initial hostility.\n\nStark recommended [[April Kepner|Dr. April Kepner]] for the Chief Resident job, after she showed that she really cares for her patients (by making a porridge and learning some words in Swahili so that not everything would be new).\n\n\n*Lexie thought Stark was gay, because he waited a whole month to make a move on April.<ref>[[This is How We Do It]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxRobertStark.png|[[Something's Gotta Give]]\nxRobertStark.png|[[Slow Night, So Long]]\nxRobertStark.png|[[Disarm]]\nRobertStark.png|[[Not Responsible]]\nxRobertStark.png|[[This is How We Do It]]\nxRobertStark.png|[[It's a Long Way Back]]\nRobertStark.png|[[White Wedding]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.png\nx-.png\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Robert Stark Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Robert Stark]]\n[[fr:Robert Stark]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stark, Robert}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He told Cathy that he could run a line up through her groin and use that to stop the bleeding. Even that was risky with her condition. She considered rejecting the surgery and allowing herself to bleed to death, but went through with it because of her daughter. In surgery, they were unable to stop the bleeding with the line, so they were forced to open her up, despite the additional risks. Despite their best efforts, she died during the surgery.\n\n\n\nCathy was very close with her daughter, Nina. They used to build dollhouses together, but Cathy's help was limited by her condition.

Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty. Five of you will crack under the pressure and two of you will be asked to leave. This is your starting line. This is your arena. How well you play? That's up to you.|'''Richard Webber'''}}\n\n'''Richard Webber''' is an [[attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]]\uaand the current [[Resident#Program Director|Residency Program Director]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]; and the current Chief Medical Officer of the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]].\uaHe is also the former [[Chief of Surgery]] at both [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. During his residency, he had an affair with [[Ellis Grey]], but he left her because he was jealous of her career. He was married to [[Adele Webber]] until her death and is now married to [[Catherine Fox]].\n\n\n\nNot much is known about Richard's childhood. His mother, [[Gail Webber|Gail]], died of pancreatic cancer when he was ten. He has a brother named [[Chris Webber]] and a sister.\n\n\nDuring residency, he grew close with [[Ellis Grey]]. They started having an affair together, planning to leave their spouses to have a life together. Ellis told her husband, but Richard overheard that she was on the shortlist for the Harper Avery Award, and decided to stay with his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]]. He was jealous of her career and he didn't want to feel that way for the rest of his life.\n\n\nRichard started having trouble seeing, and not completing simple surgeries. It turned out that he had developed a tumor, pressing against his optic nerve, and let Derek operate to remove it, under the radar of all the surgical floor. Later, he fought with Derek to write him out for surgery.\n\n\nRichard was later found to be off the wagon and drinking again. This caused him to lose his job as Chief of Surgery for a period of time to [[Derek Shepherd]], who told the board about his problem even though Meredith had attempted to stop him. He eventually sobered up again and after Derek stepped down following the shooting, he was able to regain the position.\n\n\nHis wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]], was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. When Adele was accepted on to Derek's Alzheimer's trial, Meredith tampered with the trial by ensuring Adele received the active drug, rather than a placebo.\uaOnce news of the tampering came to light, Richard took the fall for Meredith, leading to his resignation as Chief of Surgery, whilst remaining an attending general surgeon. Throughout the next year, Richard dealt with her Alzheimer's becoming worse. She eventually asked Richard to place her in the [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]]. Richard visited her a lot as he wanted to assure her that he was still there for her, but soon after she stopped recognizing him and started a romantic relationship with Allan, a fellow resident in the care facility. At first, Richard resisted, thinking Allan was taking advantage, but he soon realized Allan had Alzheimer's too and that his anger wasn't helping Adele. He then allowed Allan to take his place.\n\n\nRichard and Catherine were both examiners at the boards exam. The night before the Boards, Catherine and Richard ended up sleeping together. That is when their relationship started.\n\n\nNot long after that, Adele died of a heart attack after coming out of surgery.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter his electrocution, Richard briefly opened his eyes to see how [[Heather Brooks|Heather]], the first one to find him in the basement, got electrocuted herself and severely bumped her head. Both she and Richard were later found by Shane, who alarmed other doctors. Together with Cristina, Bailey started taking care of Richard. While his labs showed that his lactate was two, Richard started coding but they managed to revive him, after which Cristina successfully pulled off the difficult procedure to place a balloon pump without rupturing Richard's aorta. This stabilized Richard's heart and he was sent to the ICU. When his labs came back again, Richard's lactate was six, and Bailey felt he had an acute abdomen. She was worried and wanted to operate on him to look for and repair possible intra-abdominal tissue damage, but Cristina insisted his heart couldn't handle the surgery. They kept bickering until Owen reminded them to look into his medical directive. Meredith turned out to be his medical proxy, and she decided to run his labs again, and if the lactate was above six, they could operate. A little later, his labs showed that his lactate was nine, so he was wheeled into the OR with some of the doctors watching him.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n[[File:xWebberelectrocuted.png|thumb|xpx|Richard is unconscious after being electrocuted.]]\nHowever, the surgery was interrupted by\ua[[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]], who yelled at Owen and Bailey to close him up. As they hadn't found anything on the bowels yet and Richard's heart started to get unstable again, they listened to her and closed him up. Richard stabilized again after he was closed up. Catherine demanded access to Richard's chart and labs, and started to plan to move him to another hospital once he was stable enough. However, behind her back, Meredith was convinced by Bailey's feeling that something's wrong inside his abdomen, and doing nothing about it is worse than operating. She took her phone and booked an OR for Bailey to explore Richard's abdomen again. They did find necrotic tissue around the pancreas, and Bailey was extremely happy. \"When you know, you know!\" she said, just as Richard always taught them. After surgery, Richard was taken back to the ICU. As Catherine started bickering with Bailey and Meredith over how he still hadn't regained consciousness, Richard opened his eyes just as Meredith told Catherine that Richard chose her to be his family and to make his decisions for him.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nHis recovery didn't start out well as he continued to lose weight. Meredith was on maternity leave, so Bailey was now in charge of his case. When presenting the case, Shane recommended a feeding tube, but Richard refused this with Bailey supporting him in this. Behind Bailey and Richard's backs, Shane called Meredith to inform her of Richard's condition and she advised him to already order a feeding tube so it would be ready whenever Richard was ready to have it. Shane did so, but Bailey and Richard found out. They were not going to change their course of treatment, and Shane was ordered to bring Richard some soup. From outside the room, Shane noticed how much difficulties Richard was having to swallow it. When Cristina informed her over the phone that Richard still didn't have a feeding tube, Meredith felt like she abandoned Richard and failed to be a good family member, so she came to the hospital to read his labs herself. She and Shane tried to convince Bailey, who supported Richard in his decision not to have a feeding tube because it completely takes away one's dignity. Meredith pointed out that dying does too, and that would happen if they wouldn't place a feeding tube. Bailey then agreed to have another look at Richard's swallow studies with her. While they were doing so, Shane entered Richard's room and listed the consequences of not allowing a feeding tube. He told Richard that he was offering to place the tube now that they were alone, or they could wait for Meredith to do it. Richard realized that a feeding tube was necessary and allowed Shane to place it. That evening, Meredith sat by his bedside, apologizing for being such a bad family. He aggressively told her that she wasn't his family and that he had made the wrong decision to make her his medical proxy as she was too weak and sentimental. He said that she shouldn't have brought him back to life, meaning he would rather be dead right now. Meredith then let go of his hand as he turned his head away from her.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nHe continued down the path of self-destruction. Meredith told Bailey, who kept on worrying, that forcing treatment wouldn't help, he just needed to hit rock bottom. Bailey then instructed a nurse to start Richard on CPAP, which the nurse said he wouldn't like. Bailey said he didn't have to like it, he just had to do it. However, when the nurse came to his room, he started fighting her and said he didn't want breathing treatments. Bailey came into the room and told him about her other patient, who wouldn't stop fighting despite having no options. This was contrasted with Richard, who had many options but refused to try. She stated she wasn't okay with letting him die like Meredith was, so she was giving a choice. He then reached for the breathing apparatus, but only to throw it across the room. Bailey then wrestled with him to get him to wear the oxygen mask until he aggressively pushed her away into a chair. However, Bailey put [[Gene Seers|her patient]] in Richard's room, where the patient pointed out that Richard didn't look like he would be around much longer. Bailey gave them brochures for facilities that do end-of-life care, figuring that they could go through them together as they were in the same boat. While talking with Gene, Richard realized he didn't want to die in the hospital and took the breathing apparatus to start working on his lungs, with Bailey watching and smiling from outside the room.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nTogether, they continued working on his recovery until he was able to stand up and walk to the chair in his room. They called Catherine to show her the progress they made. When he showed her what he could do, he refused to accept help from Bailey, who smilingly pointed out he was now acting all too cool for school because Catherine was in the room. Leah and Shane felt a little awkward when they had to strip his JP drain and they helped him get back in bed, while Bailey and Catherine talked outside about his recovery. She expected more of the recovery, but Bailey says all he needs is support. Noticing how awkward the interns were acting when they needed to examine Richard, Catherine wanted him to come home with her. She pointed out he wasn't progressing in this hospital, as they were all coddling him because they love and fear him. Ultimately, it was a disservice to him and Catherine added he needed to be pushed and not coddled. Keeping this in mind, he told Leah that coddling makes her a bad doctor and he ordered her to give him a proper hands-on examination. Catherine overheard how Leah correctly diagnosed a pancreatic leak and complimented the bossy Richard as she came into the room. As Leah left, Richard said that the interns would have to learn to look him in the eye and answer his questions. He then answered her question to come home with her, saying that he needed to stay in the hospital as they needed him there.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nDetermined to teach the interns, Richard used his physical condition as a teaching tool. He had constant shoulder pain and he wanted Jo to come up with the correct diagnosis. Meredith interrupted to ask Bailey something about portal vein graft research, and Richard replied that it was her mother's research. She has written about it in one of the journals gave him. Back to his case, Richard told Jo that she would be kicked off the case if she couldn't find a solid answer about his pain. Her first attempt was to attach him to a scanner. While she was trying to get a clear read, Richard pulled off the sensors. He told her the pain wasn't caused by his heart or something he did, and he advised her to look deeper. She then came up with doing X-rays. He asked her what she thought she would find. Something clicked in her head and she suddenly realized he needed an ultrasound instead. Doing the ultrasound, she enthusiastically diagnosed him with a pancreatic pseudocyst. She started cheering because she found the answer, and explained how she got to it. He told her to work on her bedside manner and she apologized. He smiled and said he finally felt like he was in good hands.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Jo diagnosed him with the pancreatic pseudocyst, Richard revealed he would allow one of the second-year residents to perform the surgery to fix it. Stephanie was already out, as she walked into a wall after her eye surgery. Bailey doubted they were capable of doing the surgery, but they were able to walk her through the procedure. Richard then tasked Bailey to observe the residents in the ER and decide which one was going to operate. In the ER, Leah and Shane dropped out too. Bailey started ranting about how incompetent the residents were, but Richard came to their defense and said that she was the problem. Teaching the residents is the only thing that kept him going when it was still unsure he'd ever operate again, and she was standing in the way of that as she wouldn't let them learn. He said he'd have someone else supervise them and fired her from his case. He then asked Meredith to observe the residents and choose one to perform the cystogastrostomy. She told him she didn't have time as she had a Halloween party to get to, but when he said he would have never gotten where he was now if it weren't for her and begged her to help him teach the residents, she agreed. She chose Jo, who pulled off the surgery with success. After the surgery, Richard asked Meredith to talk to him through the whole surgery from the beginning, but Meredith allows Jo to do this in the interest of education.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nWhenever he wasn't teaching, Richard filled his days by telling old surgical stories over and over again to anyone who would listen. One of his many stories taught Stephanie the two-challenge rule. His next-door neighbor, CJ, got tired of it when he asked the residents to come back for the end of a story and yelled from her room that everyone knows the end because he'd told it so many times. He held off on exercise, which Meredith noticed. She asked if he was planning to leave the hospital because his room didn't look like he was. CJ walked by and asked him to join her on her walk, so he could hear some new stories, which she told him he needed. He said he'd catch up with her later, again refusing to get out of bed. Later that day, she was talking him through a recipe when she suddenly stopped talking as Richard heard a clattering. Richard then rushed out of bed and saw CJ collapsed on the floor. He called for help and asked for a crash cart as he started performing CPR on CJ. After he saved CJ, Richard felt exhausted in a good way. He told April that it was time for him to start working to get out of bed and be himself again. At the end of the day, Richard checked on CJ and took a walk with Callie, while telling her the story of what happened that day.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\nIn a wheelchair, Richard left the hospital for the first time in months when April drove him to the courthouse to support Callie during her malpractice lawsuit.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\nTo get out of the hospital, Richard had to pass a treadmill stress test. He failed every time but pushed Jo and Meredith to allow another one. In his room, he tried to convince Meredith he was a waste of a bed, but she replied his stress test was a disaster. He claimed he had been practicing and was thereby another man than he was last week. Meredith proposed to get him into a rehab facility as he couldn't go home on his own, but Richard refused and said he'd get a home health aid. This convinced Meredith to allow another test, which he said he'd pass, flying colors. She then invited him to the Thanksgiving Dinner at her house, and he accepted the invitation when he found out she wasn't cooking the dinner. While preparing for the treadmill test, he and Jo started talking about preparing a Thanksgiving turkey. During the treadmill test, Jo wanted to stop because his heart rate was pretty high. He wanted her to take up the treadmill, but when she refused, he did it himself. He had to start running, but couldn't keep up and fell off the treadmill. Jo called for help, and Derek and Callie came in, confirming his own diagnosis of broken ribs. Because she felt sorry about what happened, Jo and the other interns decided to hang out with Richard at the hospital at Thanksgiving. As none of them could cook a turkey, they decided to settle on fried chicken and biscuits.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he healed up, Richard passed the stress test and he was allowed to leave the hospital with a box filled with his personal stuff. He was wheeled to the elevator with several doctors seeing him off. He didn't understand why they were making such a big deal out of it and said he wanted a break from all of them. Bailey said he got himself better, but he said she was the one who did that. Not long after, Richard came back to the hospital. He met Bailey in the surgical skills lab, as he wanted to practice his skills for his return to surgery and didn't want to just sit around at home. Unknown to him, Bailey was trying to do  stitches without showing OCD behavior. He rearranged the surgical instruments on her tray. Later, Bailey yelled at Dr. Alma that she wasn't going to take the pills. Richard offered to join her to April's bridal shower to take a break, but she declined. After having yelled compliments and eaten a lot of finger food at the shower, Richard returned to the skills lab. He said that she called him a drunk before the accident. She started apologizing for that, but he said she was right: he is an alcoholic, which is why he was at the hospital instead of home because he was afraid he'd start drinking at home out of loneliness and boredom. He said he always wants a drink because he has a disease that can't be cured, only managed, but not alone. He told Bailey that she had to accept that she has a disease and needs help, after which she picked up the pill bottle and took one out of it.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nRichard scheduled his first little surgery back on the day of April's wedding. Almost everyone would be at the wedding, so there wouldn't be anyone around to make a big fuss about it. On the same day, Bailey started operating again and he told her he was proud of her. However, his plans had to change. While he was preparing for the surgery, Leah came running over and begged him for help. He accompanied her to the OR, where he found Shane staring at Jimmy Evans's chest. While ordering Leah to get rescrubbed, he asks Shane what they got. Shane kept on saying how he did this and that it's his fault while blocking Jimmy's chest with his hands. Richard took a look and concludes they needed bypass. He tried to convince Shane to take some rest, but Shane said that she would be dead when he'd come back. He added that it's his fault because he sent her to the basement. Richard then realized he was talking about Heather and what happened to her, remembering how he saw her get electrocuted. Richard assured Shane that she would be fine and that he needed to take some rest. As Shane left the OR, Richard got inside Jimmy's thorax and yelled to page someone from cardio. Jimmy deteriorated, leaving Richard performing heart massage on Alex's father.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Richard and Catherine get married.]]\n\n\nAfter some time being together, Catherine proposed to Richard in front of the entire hospital, and he agreed. They argued before the wedding and called it off briefly. However, they reconciled when Meredith helped them realize that life is too short to not be happy and together. They were married in the hospital chapel.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Bailey became Chief of Surgery, she hired Eliza Minnick to help re-shape the resident teaching program. While the residents enjoyed Minnick's program, the attendings, including Richard, felt they were being pushed out of their own surgeries. Eventually, Richard spoke up, and Bailey chose Minnick over Richard's position as director of the resident program. Most of the attendings sided with Richard, which led to Meredith being temporarily suspended for refusing to work with Minnick. Eventually, Bailey realized that Minnick's program was not as helpful as she thought, and she gave Richard back his old job title.\n\n\nOne day, Richard's sponsor, [[Olive Warner]], was admitted to the hospital and she asked for him. She told him she had reached her expiration date as her liver had already lasted longer than it should have and it also caused cardiomyopathy, which is why she was admitted. Eight months prior, she had signed a DNR and also drafted an advance directive for no intervention. Richard hated that she hadn't told him, but she said she took her personal problems to her own sponsor. Also, she didn't know how to sponsor him through her death. Richard then said he wouldn't let her die and brought in Maggie and Meredith. Ollie threatened to tell his secret to every doctor he brought in, but he had her blessing to tell them everything since they already knew. They had less trouble accepting that Ollie had reached the end of the road. She asked them to work on getting Richard to accept it and make sure he'd get through it without reaching for the bottle. They pretended that they were going to do more tests the next day and reached out to Catherine. Later, Bailey came to see him. He told her that Ollie was the keeper of his secrets and that she was how he felt God's presence. Bailey made sure he had a village of people who loved him.\n\nThe next day, Maggie and Meredith informed him that all possible options had a poor prognosis. He thought a small chance at survival was better than guaranteed death, but Ollie once again said she had made peace with it. He still thought keeping her alive was his job. Maggie later sat down with Richard and reminded her of everything she put her mother through against her wishes, which she had come to realize she only did for herself. He realized that he needed to give Ollie the ending that she wanted instead of repeating Maggie's mistake. Richard then brought Amelia to Ollie's room and they held a meeting, where he stated he had accepted the things he couldn't change.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref> Catherine arrived and made sure Richard was comfortable as he sat by Ollie's bed until she passed away. He cried over her body and later sought out Catherine. He told her he was doing fine and asked about her. She then revealed Jackson had unearthed a scandal relating to the Foundation that could ruin them all. She filled Richard in on all the details.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard demonstrates his Path Pen.]]\nShortly before Ollie's funeral, Richard gave a presentation on his Path Pen for the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. Upon his return to the hospital, he found out that several doctors had accidentally eaten weed cookies. Richard then got occupied with taking care of [[Vikram Roy]], who had neglected to tell his superiors that he, too, had eaten a contaminated cookie. He freaked out because of it while treating a patient and backed into a cart and fell, which ended with his arm being stabbed by a scalpel. Richard managed to stop the bleeding but later fired Vik for not coming clean about the cookie.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nWhen news got out about Harper Avery's sexual harassment scandal, Richard sat down with Jackson and Catherine in several meetings with a crisis manager Catherine had hired to protect the Foundation. They shut down the woman's plan to go after the assaulted women to make the scandal go away. In between meetings, Amelia found Richard and told her about Betty and her plan to take her in and help her get sober. He liked the idea and advised her to really drag Betty if she saw something in her, as Ollie had done with him. If it worked, Amelia would be saving a life. Richard, Catherine, and the crisis manager drafted a press statement, but Jackson and Meredith came in with a plan to create a new foundation in Catherine's name that would pledge itself to re-hire and re-train all the women affected by the scandal.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Bailey was met with a lawsuit for wrongful termination by Vik, she asked Richard to come to her meeting with him. Richard later admitted he may have overreacted in firing Vik, because, unlike himself, Vik never operated under the influence. He suggested Bailey could make the case go away by apologizing. Bailey didn't want to apologize if she didn't mean it, but after [[Levi Schmitt]] pointed out that she had begun a surgery while high, she deemed it fit to re-hire Vik for a one-year probationary period. That worked and Vik dropped the lawsuit.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref> \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard confronts Arizona over her leaving without telling him.]]\nSoon after, Richard found out that Arizona was looking for a job in New York as she was planning to move there with Sofia. Unhappy with his close friend moving away, he confronted her about keeping it from him. Later, Richard treated [[Matthew Taylor]] while his colleagues worked on bringing April back. He was the one to inform Arizona of their accident. They all sat by April's bed in the ICU. When she showed no signs of recovery, Richard offered to be the one to call her parents. However, she eventually woke up without deficits.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard and the other guests congratulate the newlyweds.]]\nAt Alex and Jo's wedding, Richard confronted Meredith with her offering Jo an attending job. He thought she was only doing it to keep Alex in Seattle and said it was unfair to Jo as she deserved the extra training fellowship in Boston. He later overheard Arizona tell April that she was falling for Callie again and that that was a catastrophe. Together with April, he convinced her that it was actually a good thing. Arizona told the two of them that she was going to miss them and they hugged. When the wedding was called off due to several things going wrong, Richard and the other guests took the ferry back to the city, where he witnessed an impromptu wedding between Alex and Jo officiated by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nEver since Ollie's death, Richard had stopped going to meetings but he also didn't start drinking again. Catherine stuck around to look after him. At work, Richard and Andrew treated [[Barry Clemens|a man]] who inserted one of his wife's hair products into his rectum. In surgery, Vik cauterized a bleed against Richard's advice, which ignited the hair spray and caused a fire in the man's abdomen. Vik was wounded by the can that was propelled across the room and taken away, while Richard and Andrew attempted to save Barry, to no avail.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> Upon hearing that Bailey was looking for an interim Chief, Richard threw his name in the mix, but Bailey told him it wouldn't be him because she wanted the job back one day. She inquired if he had a new sponsor, but he stated he was just talking to Catherine. He thought the two of them had been talking behind his back, but they hadn't. Bailey said she just remembered what happened the last time he was Chief. With Ollie's death, she didn't want to add extra stress to his plate, which is why she chose not to appoint him interim Chief. He claimed he left for a meeting, but at the exit, he came across Andrew on his newly acquired motorcycle. He offered Richard to take a ride. Reluctantly, Richard got on, and, much to his surprise, he liked the feeling and asked for the helmet so he could take the ride.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nAlex was chosen as interim Chief instead. On Alex's first day, Richard treated [[Dave Buckley]], a teacher who collapsed at work while he was helping a kid lead a block into a table saw. His labs showed extremely high alcohol levels, which triggered Richard and made him determined to follow the case all the way through. In surgery, while Link was working on Dave's fingers with local anesthetics, Richard told Dave that this was what rock bottom looked like and that he needed to take responsibility. Dave maintained it was an accident and that he didn't drink. Richard berated Dave to get him to confess until Alex threw him off the case.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard challenges Dave's sobriety.]]\nAfter a mom of one of Dave's students insisted that she knew alcoholics and that Mr. Buckley wasn't one, Richard went to his room and challenged him by placing a bottle of vodka in front of Dave. However, he refused to drink, which Richard had never known an alcoholic to do. He ran labs again, which still showed that Dave was drunk. Richard then diagnosed auto-brewery syndrome. At the end of the day, Richard told Andrew he was missing his wife. Link and Andrew then invited Richard to come with them to Joe's, where they could also do other things beside drink alcohol.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAs Chief, Alex asked Richard for advice when his patient refused surgery because his insurance didn't cover it. Richard only told him to be creative, refusing to do the job for him. Alex then stabbed the patient with a scalpel so the surgery would qualify as trauma surgery. Richard found out and yelled at him, saying he had opened himself up to serious consequences, but the patient was happy to have had the surgery and didn't press charges.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nRichard found out that his new friend Link and Jo went all the way back to undergrad. While Jo assured him their history wasn't romantic, Richard understood Alex's dismay over it as he felt the same about finding out that Catherine had a history with Tom. Throughout the day, Richard supervised Andrew as he took charge of the ER. He urged Andrew to take initiative while handling the interns and to remember that they were working at a teaching hospital. At the end of the day, he told Andrew he saw potential in him, so he wanted to push him to be the best he could be and also help Andrew to teach the interns to be their best selves. After work, Link, Andrew, and Richard went to Joe's, where Link and Andrew played their guitars while Richard sang \"The Thrill Is Gone.\"<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nRichard found out through an AA friend that [[Thatcher Grey]] had AML and that he only had a few weeks to live. He found Meredith and told her. The news about Thatcher made Richard visit Ollie's grave. He told her that it had been hard since she passed away and that he had avoided meetings because they only reminded him that she was gone.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWith Catherine away to Los Angeles for Foundation business, Richard spent a few days by himself. At work, he treated [[Frankie Shavelson]], a pregnant, beloved nurse he was close with. She had a wandering spleen, which began to untwist by itself. While he was checking up on her, she expressed worries over him. He admitted it had been hard since Ollie's death and due to Catherine's frequent travels. He maintained that he was fine, though. However, the spleen problem played up again and Richard had to operate. Alex delivered the baby while Richard had trouble controlling the bleeding. Richard did his best, but Frankie passed away. He couldn't bring himself to call time of death, so Alex did that for him. He delivered the news to the other nurses.\n\nEqually distraught as the nurses, Richard finally found the motivation to go to a meeting again. The person speaking there mentioned a bar exchanging shots for AA chips. Richard then got up and left. Richard found the bar and showed the bartender his -year chip. The bartender poured him eight vodka shots per his order. Richard looked at the shots and grabbed his chip back. He then went behind the bar and grabbed a baseball bat, smashing the shots and all bottles on the shelves. The bartender threatened the call the police. Richard invited him to do so so that he could tell them how the man was taking advantage of vulnerable people who were struggling to hang onto everything they've got. Eventually, the police arrived and Richard was arrested. He called Meredith, who was out in Los Angeles with Catherine and had just helped diagnose Catherine's spinal tumor, and told her that he had been arrested. He made her promise not to tell Catherine.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith flew back to Seattle and bailed him out. She then brought up the fact that he hadn't found a new sponsor yet. He admitted he lost control. Knowing Catherine would soon need help, she told him to get his head in a place where he could take care of the people who depend on him. Richard went to the hospital and told Bailey, who was stepping in for Alex due to his being trapped at home by the windstorm, about his arrest. He agreed to her plan to inform the board and bench him for the day. He went to check on Frankie's baby, who was surrounded by nurses. He then noticed he had three missed calls from Catherine and called her back. Much to his surprise, Tom answered the call. Richard thought Catherine was having an affair with him, so he decided to read the Bible to find serenity and then find himself a new sponsor. Bailey scoffed at the idea of Catherine having an affair. She then told him about her marriage sabbatical. He pointed out she was trying to fix the inside from the outside, which wouldn't work, so he advised her to get real help.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nRichard took charge when the storm caused a power outage at the hospital, trapping three elevators between floors. He had an altercation with the head of maintenance while urging him to get the doors open. In between, he tried to reach Catherine, but she still didn't answer his calls. He then came across Betty, who was looking for Amelia, and decided they would occupy their minds by being useful. They bonded a bit and she told him that she felt that if she could get clean for a few months, she could put her life back together and get Leo back. He advised her to take it one day at a time.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard catches Betty looking for drugs.]]\nHe was paged away and sent her back to the ER, but he later found her looking for drugs in a cabinet. She begged him not to tell Amelia, but he couldn't call himself a doctor if he complied with that request. After he watched Amelia convince Betty to accept a place in rehab, Richard was approached by Jackson, who asked if he had talked to his mother. Since he hadn't, Jackson took him to a private room so they could talk. Jackson then told him that Catherine had a grade  chondrosarcoma on her spine.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nIn light of Catherine's diagnosis, Richard resumed going to meetings regularly, where another attendee offered to be his new sponsor. At work, Richard, Catherine, and Jackson performed a pelvic exenteration together. Catherine struggled in surgery, so Jackson offered to take over for her. Furious over his confronting her with her cancer in public, she finished her part and left. Jackson and Richard found her cooling down in a lounge and confronted her about hiding her cancer from them. She told Richard she couldn't exactly lean on him with his going around demolishing bars. After Catherine dismissed Richard's jealousy of Tom, Jackson and Richard convinced her that they could handle bad news, so there was no need to lie to them. She then said telling them about the cancer made it real for her, after which she broke down and they comforted her.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Catherine's surgery, Richard went to a meeting in the morning. At work, he convinced Meredith to go see her father before it was too late and then joined Catherine in her room. Tom and Amelia came in to explain their approach. Richard took Catherine to the OR. She told him he didn't need to sit in the gallery the entire time and told him she'd see him on the other side. After a kiss and hug, they danced with the staff and Jackson to \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" the song that had kept Catherine calm through all the scans. The surgery started. Jackson couldn't handle sitting there so he left with Maggie, but Richard knew that Catherine secretly wanted him there because showing up for one another when they really needed it is how they made their long-distance relationship work. Bailey came to with him. When things got dire, Richard closed the gallery. He couldn't bring himself to watch the team flip Catherine on the table, so Bailey held his hand and informed him once it was over. When Tom and Amelia's approach had to be changed to removing the tumor piecemeal, Richard convinced them to use his Path Pen. They removed as much tumor as they could, but they to leave a small part behind in order to leave her brachial plexus unscathed and thus save her career. Catherine thanked them for saving her life and made peace with the fact that she would have to live with cancer for the rest of her life. Richard went outside to took a moment to gather himself and then joined Amelia to a meeting, where she talked about giving him his wife back and being grateful for being sober to experience every terrifying, exhilarating, imperfect moment of the surgery.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine had a hard time recovering over the holidays. She shut Richard out and refused any help. She went to bed early on Christmas Eve, leaving Richard to finish dinner with Maggie and Jackson. She also lashed out at her physical therapist, because she dismissed Catherine's request for exercises to get her sensual self back. Richard brought up average recovery time to convince her not to wear herself out, but she said she wasn't average and left the room. Jackson and Maggie regularly visited to check on them. During one particular visit, Catherine fell off the treadmill. She broke down in Richard's arms and told him she couldn't do this. However, over time, things went better. On Valentine's Day, Catherine apologized to him for having been impossible. He didn't want to hear her apologize as he couldn't imagine what she was going through, but he promised to be there for her for every step of it. He told her she couldn't be average if she tried. She then found her sexual appetite back and asked him to take her the bedroom, which he did.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Bailey grew increasingly frustrated with Alex occupying her job. With two weeks left, she raged that Alex was given credit in an article about the hospital's innovation. Richard said that's just how it goes sometimes and shared a story of how she performed emergency surgery on a patient he had been treating for years, which is why the patient now sent her a basket of pears every year instead of him.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy and Richard save Betty.]]\nWhile Meredith was breaking the hospital's longest surgery record, the ER was flooded with victims from a mass overdose. Richard fetched all residents from the gallery and later found Owen working on Betty. Owen had Richard call Amelia. Richard watched over Betty while the doctors diagnosed an aortic dissection caused by the mixture of opioids and meth. Richard scrubbed in with Teddy to place a stent. That went well, but they found they had to also reconstruct the entire distal aorta. They managed to pull it off and Betty made it through surgery. At the end of the day, Richard, Teddy, and Link took a moment to rest in a quiet ER.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nRichard was amongst the first guests to arrive for Catherine's party at Jackson's penthouse. Alex shared an article from [[Kimberly Thompson]] about her experience with Maggie, which focused on she advocated for herself to convince Maggie to operate. While Richard found the article moving, Maggie hated Kiki for telling her story and making it seem like she healed herself with her magical narcissism. Later, Richard overheard Owen complaining about Tom taking advantage of Teddy and told him that Tom had been after Catherine, too. Richard later caught Meredith and Andrew making out in the guest room and quickly left. Maggie later heard him talking about the article and told him to stop because it made her feel small and insignificant and it pissed her off. Richard talked about being bullied as the only black resident in his class and how it made him realize there's no point in being pissed off unless you do something with it. He then advised Maggie to take back her story and tell it louder. When the party had to be evacuated because of a supposed fire, Richard, Catherine, Jackson, and Maggie got in the limo and celebrated with burgers, champagne, and cider for Richard. Maggie had decided to follow Richard's advice. Catherine liked them being together and said they'd celebrate every scan together like this, no matter the outcome.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Maggie guested on a medical podcast, she accidentally let slip that Ellis Grey was her mother. The news of her biological parents spread in the medical community and Richard was asked for a comment. He lashed out at Maggie for not thinking about the consequences when she revealed his affair to the world. She later found him and he told her it was her story to tell, but he just hated that Catherine had to deal with it on top of everything else. He said he was not particularly proud of that story. She was hurt and told him that the story culminated in her existence. He later found her and said he was proud of her despite the shame about the circumstances of how she was conceived. She knew she was a scandal. Richard told her she was the best of him, Ellis, and her parents who raised her beautifully and that he was proud to be any part of her. That was what he would tell the press if they reached out for any more comment.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Richard found out that Jackson had the interns de-scale tilapia for his spray-on skin project, he gathered the fish and hosted a fish fry on the hospital roof.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> Catherine decided not to go back to work any time soon, but she wouldn't elaborate as to why only telling Richard \"cancer card.\" When Jackson and Richard treated [[Toby Donnelly]] together, Richard had troubles using the right pronouns since they were gender non-binary. He admitted it was hard to keep up with the world, but he just needed some guidance and patience to adjust. With the help from Taryn and Jackson, he got the hang of the pronouns.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nOn the heels of Andrew and Meredith making their relationship public, Richard scheduled a lap appy for Andrew. Andrew examined the patient, who complimented him on his looks in front of Richard. She then asked Andrew to check out her Instagram. Richard told him it was part of the job so Andrew complied and listened to the patient talk about Crossfit. In surgery, Richard asked about the long-term plan. Andrew thought he was talking about his relationship with Meredith and said they hadn't discussed it yet. He said he respected where Meredith came from and that she was amazing to him. Richard then said he meant Andrew's career. Andrew said he was attracted to general surgery. The surgery had to be converted to an open procedure when they came across dead bowel. Richard wanted to take over, but Andrew knew the steps of an ileocecectomy and pulled it off. Once Andrew was done, Richard complimented Andrew and said he'd put in a good word with the head of general surgery. He ran into Meredith after and told her that Andrew did well and that he was a good man, subtly giving her his blessing. He later went by Bailey's office because she had found out that Alex had been handing off paperwork to interns. They agreed it was a genius move but that he could never found out that they thought that. That night, Richard took Catherine for a stroll in the park to de-stress after she completed a complicated transplant surgery as her first surgery back.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard made peace with his AA acquaintance.]]\nWhen an AA acquaintance of Richard's was admitted to the hospital with a heel impaling her chest, Richard kept showing up to provide support against Gemma's wishes. Ollie was Gemma's sponsor, too, but unlike Richard, she didn't have a family to fall back on after Ollie's death. She started drinking again and fell down the stairs while carrying her heels after a night out. While she didn't want him on the case and even had Maggie throw him out of the room, he showed up in the scrub room to talk to Maggie. He told her that while maybe he didn't resort to drinking, Ollie's death made him an angry dry drunk and if he hadn't had a lot of money to settle with that bar, he would have been in prison by now. Maggie was then paged , so Richard had to take over from her. The surgery went well and Richard admitted to Gemma that he was the one who had operated on her. She let it slide and they laughed about what had happened to her. She wanted her  years back. He told her to focus on today instead of the number of years and shared the story of how he almost lost his  years not too long ago.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nOne day at work, Richard noticed that \"Ellis Shepherd\" was scheduled for an ex lap. Richard rushed to the scrub room and found out that Meredith had put her daughter's name down so an immigrant's daughter could benefit from her insurance since the man earned too much to qualify for the state coverage but too little to pay for the surgery himself. Meredith refused to ship the kid off to County because she needed Alex Karev-level care after being separated from her parents for months at the border. Richard acknowledged the system was wrong but that she had chosen the wrong way to attempt to fix it. In surgery, they found out that the girl's obstruction was caused by lymphoma, meaning her case would drag on after this surgery. After the surgery, Richard yelled at her because his AA program required rigorous honesty in all his affairs, so keeping this secret was threatening his sobriety. He pointed out she could lose her license or her kids if she were sent to jail as well as the fact that implicating [[Luis Rivera]] in insurance fraud wouldn't help with his asylum. Richard then come up with a plan to make [[Gabriella Rivera]] sicker on paper so they could keep her there for  days, which would automatically activate a new state policy regardless of income.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Catherine surprised Richard when she showed up at the hospital. She had to come down there for Foundation business. She and Bailey locked themselves in a conference room with people in suits would divulging the reason behind the meetings. Richard grew increasingly worried while wild rumors about the meeting started to spread. Richard scrubbed in to repair a punctured rectum. In surgery, he taught [[Nico Kim]] that you need to find humor in the job in order to be able to survive in it.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAfter surgery, Richard saw Andrew being escorted away in handcuffs by the police. Andrew told him he had committed fraud and Bailey filled him in on the details. She asked Richard to come to the ER with her for incoming casualties, but he wandered off. He found Meredith stuck in the hyperbaric chamber with Alex and [[Gus Carter]]. She asked him to go set the record straight, but he didn't want to land her in jail and leave her kids without their mother. As Gus started coding, Richard ordered the techs to decompress the chamber. \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard is fired along with Alex and Meredith for covering up the latter's insurance fraud.]]\nRichard and Bailey operated together and she told Richard she was suspecting that Andrew did not do it alone and that he was just covering for Meredith. She asked if he knew anything about that, but Richard dodged the question. After surgery, Richard found Alex asked him to come. They interrupted Meredith's meeting with Catherine and Bailey and defended her actions, stating that they knew but had failed to report it. They just couldn't put that father through more misery. Bailey then decided to fire all three of them.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nRichard took to an AA meeting to vent his anger over his mentee firing him while his wife sat back and did nothing, predicting he wouldn't be able to forgive them any time soon. He got a job working for a health app, which required him to make house calls for minor illnesses, providing him with excuses to avoid Catherine at home. He soon quit and interviewed for the Chief of Surgery position at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]], the lowest-ranked hospital in Seattle. He was offended when the interviewer bluntly asked if he wasn't planning on retiring any time soon since the job was enormous and they were looking for somebody in the long run, as they wanted to overturn the facility to improve its ranking. After a week, he went to check if they had called Alex, whom he had put down as a reference. Alex didn't know since he never answers calls of unknown numbers. Noticing Alex had let his life fall apart, Richard suggested he interview for the job and then hire him as an attending. While initially hesitant, Alex was convinced when Richard pointed out he needed to get his life back in order to give Jo a reason to come back. Alex was hired and he hired Richard. Catherine found out and angrily confronted him, saying his working there humiliated her and her Foundation. He shot back that she just let him be fired and went to sleep on the couch.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOn his first day at Pac-North, Richard discovered the hospital only had two residents, both of whom were terrible doctors because they were too swamped with scut to hone their mediocre skills. He went to complain to Alex about it and to demand an office. Alex reminded him of the hospital's terrible ranking and that they were supposed to turn it around. Throughout the day, Richard was confronted with how terrible the hospital was compared to Grey Sloan, like a malfunctioning CT and a crowded ER with personnel that paged him for non-surgical cases. During an emergency surgery with Alex, Richard told him he didn't want to work there after having worked at Grey Sloan for  years. He figured he'd drop dead one day in OR , a thought that made him happy. They managed to save the patient, which was about the only thing that went right that day. Afterward, Alex admitted he also had had his doubts about Pac-North but he had become invested to change things around so that failure was no longer the culture there. He made Richard see he could help him do that and find a new legacy for himself in doing so, which would also prove Bailey wrong. Alex had also arranged for a janitorial closet to be turned into Richard's office.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nAlex and Richard started changing things for the better with baby steps, like a new MRI machine. While Catherine was away for Foundation business, Richard found out that his calls had landed [[Gemma Larson]] a job in the billing department of Pac-North. Richard had a brain dead patient whose sisters needed to decide if they wanted him to pull the plug. Since the sisters had drifted apart, they kept arguing, which prevented them from making a decision. Richard broke up the fighting and told them to come together for the decision so that their sister's death would mean something for their sisterhood. They decided to pull the plug. However, after Richard did that, the patient's phone rang and they discovered that the woman they had just unplugged had stolen her bag, meaning Richard had unplugged a random woman. Richard informed Alex and told the sisters to use this opportunity to forgive one another and reconnect with each other and their third sister. He informed Alex and then left him to clean up the mess. He tried calling Catherine but she didn't answer. He then ran into Gemma, who had heard about what had happened and asked him for details over dinner. He agreed and they left together.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWith the basics at the hospital set straight, Richard and Alex started to have time to teach the two residents. Richard was upset when he discovered the article that had come out in Meredith's name trashing Grey Sloan, a sentiment not shared by Alex. Richard let [[Cecil Taylor]] scrub in with him to operate on [[Yan Huang]], who had refused to be treated at Grey Sloan because of Meredith's trending article.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nWhile on his way out after an all-night surgery, Richard ran into Gemma, who insisted on buying him breakfast with her paycheck. He conceded and they left together. Over breakfast, they briefly talked about her unsuccessful search for a new sponsor and work until she steered the conversation towards his marriage. He talked about their recent fight, how the passionate light in Catherine seemed to have gone out, and how he didn't know how to get it back. He talked about how, as a -year-old boy, he feared his father wouldn't have his love sitting next to him on his porch for the rest of his life when his mother died. Gemma told him she was the opposite and always wanted a rotation of men rather than marriage. Richard said he had never been that. She proceeded to touch his hand meaningfully. He pulled back and she questioned why he pulled away from the first little bit of comfort he'd had in weeks. He cited his marriage as the reason. She said she was thinking that because he and Catherine had hit the \"worse\" part of their vows, he may be looking around. She had no intention of competing with Catherine but she didn't think he should be miserable until they found their way back to one another. She explicitly stated she was here and that life was too short to deprive themselves of what they had been feeling for so many years. Richard told her she had mistaken her friendship for something else. He apologized if he had done anything to mislead her but stated there was nothing between them, nor would there ever be. She reminded him that when hard times hit, he had a habit of burying himself in either another woman or a bottle of vodka, only one of which he could properly handle. He went to grab his coat and she surprised him with a kiss. He pushed her off of him and left. She followed him, thinking he was just lying about not being attracted to her. He told her he was in love with his wife. Gemma threw his tumultuous love life in his face. Richard refused to let her use his history to make herself less lonely and pointed out she was in dire need of a sponsor.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Richard helped Alex to lead a group of investors around the hospital. They tried to distract them from a chaotic ER and failing residents. Richard learned from Alex that the construction workers had discovered a mass grave on the construction site of the new research wing. They decided not to tell the investors and Richard continued the tour by himself to let Alex handle the administrative side. He managed to keep the investors busy the entire day only to walk in and have them overhear Alex while he was loudly announcing his handling of the mass grave to keep gossiping nurses in check.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Richard began ignoring Gemma. When she confronted him about it, he turned down her offer to let her make up for her behavior over coffee. He was surprised when Maggie showed up at Pac-North with his brother [[Chris Webber]] and niece [[Sabrina Webber|Sabi Webber]], whom he hadn't seen in five years. Sabi then revealed to Richard and Maggie that she had a large cardiac tumor. While Sabi had a new scan taken, Richard explained to Maggie that he had left his family behind because they thought he deemed himself better than them, and he wanted to protect Maggie from their hostile behavior. The scan then revealed that the tumor had grown considerably and invade its surroundings. Maggie wanted to operate but Sabi did not want to be operated on by family. While Maggie didn't see how that applied as they had only known each other for a few hours, Richard sided with Sabi and paged the on-call cardiac surgeon from Pac-North, which angered Maggie. She did agree to consult with the surgeon, though. However, as Sabi's condition grew dire quickly, Richard honestly said he wanted Maggie to operate, which convinced Sabi to consent. When Chris left the waiting room to go call family, Gemma came to sit with Richard. He told her part of the conflict with his family consisted of his brother blaming his alcoholism on his ambition, which bothered him. As Gemma put a reassuring hand on Richard's shoulder, Catherine arrived. Gemma quickly left. Richard was surprised to see Catherine, who said she had to come as it was a family matter. He and Chris then reminisced about Sabi as a child. Privately, Richard explained Gemma's presence to Catherine, who took it as an admission of guilt. Soon after, Alex and Maggie delivered the bad news that Sabi had died on the table. Chris exploded in rage and yelled at Maggie. Catherine tried to defuse the situation and took Richard and his brother to go say goodbye to Sabi.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nRichard isolated himself from his loved ones. He attended Sabi's funeral without Catherine, Maggie, and Jackson as his family wasn't ready to see them. He arrived back in town the night before Meredith's trial with the medical board. At the hotel, he apologized to Jackson for not having reached out while in Boston and he snapped at Bailey, who commented on the amount of people that had taken time off work to come support Meredith. Richard followed the entire hearing and was called to the stand. The tampered-with Alzheimer's trial was brought up and Richard again took all the blame, frustrating Bailey. [[Patricia Murphy]] revealed in her testimony that Richard made a call to the NRMP to get Meredith a spot at Seattle Grace, displaying his habit of bending the rules in her favor. During the break, Bailey confronted him with his lying for Meredith, enabling her in her behavior rather than setting her straight. He said his taking the fall for her was his choice and that he only wrote a recommendation for her. Bailey pointed out he always went around the system for Meredith, regardless of the consequences, which Richard pointed out was her being jealous. He admitted to giving her special treatment due to his history with Ellis, which made him think of Meredith as family, which had made him willing to do the things he did. Bailey then vented her frustrations over the consequences she had faced because of their insurance fraud. She felt betrayed by someone she raised. He said he recognized that feeling from when she had torpedoed Meredith's character with her cold testimony. He thought Bailey would stick out her neck for Meredith like he had done. The trial then resumed and ended with Meredith getting to keep her license.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nGemma continued to look after Richard at work. Owen witnessed their close interaction but Richard assured him Gemma was just a friend. Gemma came by his office later where they talked about Sabi and Richard's fight with Catherine. Gemma brought up her husband's death, which made her start drinking. As they went to say a prayer together, [[Zander Perez]] briefly came in to complain about a procedure, believing Gemma to be Richard's wife, but Richard sent him away to go do his job. After Richard witnessed some flirty interactions between Owen and Daphne Lopez, a prospective ER doctor, he warned Owen that he was going down a slippery slope. When Owen said he was taken, Richard pointed out he hadn't yet proposed to Teddy and wondered what he was waiting for. That evening, as he was leaving with Gemma, Richard received a text from Catherine saying that she had left town for business. However, he didn't even know she had been in Seattle. He then told Gemma that Catherine was thinking that there was something going on between him and Gemma.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a car crashed into Joe's bar, Meredith called in Richard and Owen to help out at Grey Sloan as multiple residents had been injured. Bailey granted them privileges and Richard took on the case of [[Taryn Helm]]. Privately, Ben asked Richard to keep an eye out on Bailey as she wasn't giving herself time to process her recent miscarriage. Richard cautiously tried to let Bailey know that Ben had told him what was going on but she kept the conversation about work. However, during surgery, she couldn't bring herself to crack open Taryn's chest. Richard took over and they managed to save her life. Afterward, the two of them lingered in the OR and he told her all the residents had been saved. Finally having the time to let herself feel the grief, she broke down in Richard's arms. Richard later went to fetch Meredith and they dropped by Bailey's office with tissues and doughnuts to comfort her.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nUpon hearing Maggie had quit her job after Sabi's death and that Chris was suing her, he took a day off and went to see her at home. He wanted to take her out to go eat something but given her appearance, he thought it was better to eat in. As he was looking for food to make her breakfast, she told him she didn't deserve compassion from him. Since there was no food at the house, he said they would start with coffee while she insisted that she wanted to be alone. Over coffee, Richard told Maggie that she was Sabi's only shot. He told Maggie he hadn't been able to look at her because he sent her into that OR knowing Sabi was unlikely to survive. Maggie said it was all her fault as she had forgotten to ask about Sabi's clotting time, which she was used to being told by the OR staff at Grey Sloan. It had made her question her aptitude. She then begged Richard to leave. He left but soon returned with food. Maggie asked Richard to yell at her, knowing he had lost way more than her. Richard remained calm and shared with her the lesson that his mother had taught him: talk about your problems over pancakes. He made pancakes and as they were eating, he went over Sabi's case to find what he could have done better. Maggie insisted it was not his fault. Richard then told her she was just imperfect and human, which nobody had ever had to tell her before. Richard then advised her to let insurance settle with Chris to give him the sense that something came of Sabi's death. He stressed that Maggie was too skilled to quit and that Sabi wouldn't want that. Maggie wished she had gotten to know Sabi better so Richard invited her to ask him everything she wanted to know about her. That night at home, he found Catherine waiting for him. She had found out he hadn't shown up for work all day. He said he was trying to convince Maggie to go back to work but she questioned how that could  take all day. Richard pointed out things wouldn't work if she didn't trust him. She agreed and said she wasn't sure if things were working.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nRichard and Catherine talked it over and agreed to get a divorce. They planned on telling their children over dinner, which Richard found too much, but Catherine insisted. Maggie arrived first, figuring it was a dinner party for their anniversary. As soon as Jackson arrived, Richard wanted to get to the point but Catherine interrupted by handing out wine as she wanted to wait until after dinner. Unbeknownst to the hosts, Jackson had invited Vic, who brought Dean to set him up with Maggie. Catherine took Richard to the kitchen and said she didn't want to tell their children with all the extra people. They agreed to get through the night without letting Jackson and Maggie know. Over dinner, Catherine dissed Pac-North to hurt Richard. To defuse the tension, Dean asked Catherine and Richard how they met. Jackson and Maggie told their story, including their proposal. Jackson then made a toast to their perfect marriage. While preparing dessert, Catherine admitted she had forgotten about the proposal story and it had made her realize that they always managed to find a way through the bad times. She asked him not to give up yet. He asked her to apologize first for not showing him loyalty and turning her back on him when he had to rebuild his entire life. She couldn't bring herself to truly apologize, causing Richard to declare that it was too late for their marriage to be saved.\n\nOver dessert, Richard started texting. Catherine openly accused him of cheating on her with Gemma. Richard revealed he had actually been in touch with Alex to approve an offer to hire Maggie at Pac-North. Jackson made a snide comment. Having had enough with all the tension, Catherine finally blurted out that she and Richard were getting a divorce. Richard apologized to the children for them having to find out this way. He went out to get some air, where Maggie came to sit with him. He told her it was truly over with Catherine. She comforted him and accepted the job offer. Once the guests were gone, he went inside to pack for a hotel but Catherine already called her driver. He told Catherine that Maggie had accepted his offer, which only infuriated Catherine more. She said that she was embarrassed for him throwing his career away and now dragging Maggie down with him. He knew that she hated how Maggie would put their hospital on the map and it would be out of Catherine's control. As he stressed that he was now free to do as he pleased, she pulled out his phone and made a call to her finance guy to look into buying Pac-North. She casually said she could shut it down. She told him she wasn't sorry about a damn thing and headed out the door.<ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref>\n\nOn Monday, Richard told Owen that Catherine had bought the hospital after a fight. She made them go over to Grey Sloan and interview with Tom, who would decide if they would be hired at Grey Sloan. Tom called in Richard first and told him his job was safe, as Catherine requested. Richard was angry about Catherine playing him like a piece of chess and turned the offer down. Richard left to go to a meeting but couldn't bring himself to go the empty house afterward. Jackson found Richard on a bench outside the hospital in the evening. Jackson thought it would all blow over soon but Richard wasn't too sure about that. Jackson then gathered Bailey, Meredith, and Owen and the five of them met with Tom. They told him they were prepared to quit en masse, which would piss Catherine off, unless he agreed to their terms. Part of the deal was that Richard would be re-hired. Tom was forced to agree to their ultimatum.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nTo distract Richard from his marriage falling apart, Bailey had him train the new residents who had been hired from Pac-North. She also invited him to dinner but he didn't appreciate her fussing over him. All day, Richard was distracted while the residents practiced in the skills lab. After Bailey heard that Richard had dismissed the residents before  P.M., she found him sitting outside. He told her he didn't want her checking up on him. He added that having those subpar residents at Grey Sloan felt like a punishment, like Catherine had won. Bailey expressed worry after he told her he was bone tired, cautiously suggesting he was suffering from depression. He told her he would be okay and left.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a skills lab, a resident named Tess Desmond asked Richard why he was still practicing despite his immense amount of experience. He replied that practice was the key to experience. After Tess said she didn't understand why the other residents weren't taking their job more seriously after everything they had been through to get there, Richard invited her to practice her laparoscopic skills with him. After Tess calmly reassured a patient during rounds, Richard invited her to scrub in with him. As they were scrubbing in, she listed all the steps to the procedure and Richard said he would allow her to perform the procedure, much to her astonishment. However, before she made the first cut, Levi came barging in and announced that Tess was actually his patient, [[Tess Anderson]]. She was taken back to her room, where she explained that she had had to let go of her dream of becoming a surgeon after going through four types of cancer in eight years drained her college funds. She just wanted to live her dream for one day. Richard then performed the procedure with Taryn after all. He visited Tess afterward and said his dream of becoming a surgeon was harder than it was for others, too, but he stuck with it. He then revealed he had developed a tremor in his hands, preventing him from operating again, as would any treatment for it. In an attempt to inspire her not to give up on chasing the most beautiful job in the world, he gave her his stethoscope, saying he wouldn't need it anymore.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOne morning, Richard received a letter from Alex, which he took with him to an AA meeting. He quickly read it and angrily threw it away. During the meeting, he spoke about the rush of being a surgeon and training young minds. He said a student he wouldn't have put money on at first stepped up and became a stellar surgeon and a fine teacher. Said student informed him through a letter that he would abandoned his entire life to be a father to the two children he apparently had with his ex-wife, whom he now loved again. Richard wanted to yell at him for making that mistake but having fallen in love with two women at the same time before and having missed his own child growing up, he knew Alex had to follow his heart and gut. Richard admitted he mostly felt robbed of the chance to say goodbye, even more so after they had begun to turn Pac-North around. He concluded that lately, all his loved ones were disappearing and he couldn't find a way to make it stop. As he finished his talk, his hand was shaking again.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Richard handed off his entire service, only teaching skills lab anymore. Soon after, Richard found movers moving his furniture from Pac-North into his office at Grey Sloan. He demanded they take the furniture back, much to Bailey's surprise. Richard left to teach a skills lab. Afterward, Bailey took him back to his office and showed him she arranged for his old furniture from before his firing to be moved into place. However, he got angry again for her assuming that that is what he wanted. In a hissy fit, he declined her offer to call building services and started throwing things onto the floor. At the end of the day, Bailey found Richard sitting in his empty office and brought up his handing off his service. He admitted the smallest thing set him off these days and apologized for his outburst. He told her he was stepping back from surgery, which is why he didn't want to use this office anymore. It reminded him of another time, another him, and it cluttered his mind. He held his hand to stop it from shaking while he said he wanted to look ahead. Bailey said the hospital needed him. He simply said he wanted to step away while at the top of his game.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn [[Pro Bono Surgery Day|pro bono surgery day]], Maggie let Richard know that she had settled with [[Chris Webber|Chris]] like Richard had advised her to. Richard then shared that Catherine had sent over divorce papers. She let him keep his own house. Meredith then came up and tried to talk him into joining the pro bono surgical team but he turned her down. Jackson later ran into him and asked about his day. Richard just said he had nothing and walked off. At night, Jackson invited Richard to the game that night to show him that he wasn't picking sides in the divorce. Richard happily accepted.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nRichard traveled to Los Angeles to present his PathPen at the LA Surgical Innovation Conference. He called Maggie \"Meredith\" upon meeting her in the lobby but blamed it on the flight. He had rewritten his talk  times and was eager to share his Pen with the world. As he was working on his speech by himself in his room, he was surprised when Catherine showed up at his door with an apology for her behavior. He then admitted Gemma had kissed him. They then laughed about their expensive fight and lied down on the bed. The next morning, he ordered breakfast for her. He was vigorously working on his speech by the time she woke up, rambling on about a luminous insight into cancer. He kept going on as she encouraged him. Unaware that he had been talking to a hallucination the entire time, he declared he was finished and recited his talk to her, working in a joke per her advice. Later that day, he took the stage with many of his colleagues watching the livestream from home. After a charming introduction, he announced that he wasn't going to talk about his Pen and declared that with his brilliant wife's help, he had found a way to cure cancer, alarming his loved ones, including Catherine back in Seattle, who assumed he was drunk. He then started his chaotic, nonsensical talk about cells and cancer and went through slides of hand-drawn pictures of organs and atomic explosions, stating that cells need apologies. A slide showed Catherine's name written in a heart. As he went on, Teddy called for help while Maggie and Cormac got on the stage and told him that he wasn't feeling well. Not recognizing her, he tried to keep going and got a little aggressive. Maggie and Cormac escorted him off the stage and got him on a gurney. As he was taken away, he suddenly recognized Maggie again and asked her what was happening, while it dawned on him he had been hallucinating the entire night.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine boarded her private plane to Los Angeles to go pick up Richard and Maggie. While flying back to Seattle, Maggie found memes online mocking Richard. Catherine's publicist got to work trying to minimize the damage. While the attendings gathered in a war room to find the diagnosis, Richard got settled in a room, again not realizing something was wrong. Catherine played along with her being at the conference and claimed he got sick after his presentation, which is why they were running the test. While they performed a PET scan, Richard cited all steps of a Whipple procedure to prove that he wasn't losing his mind. The scan showed no signs of Alzheimer's or Lewy Body dementia. Andrew paid Richard a visit in his room, pretending it was a social visit, even though he was in contact with [[Lauren Riley]]. Maggie and Meredith later performed some cognitive testing, which he failed miserably. They brushed it off as his being tired to keep him calm. Later, Richard disappeared from his room. His loved ones spread out to find him. Meredith found him in a dark OR about to cut himself open for an ex-lap, stating he was the only one who could fix this. Meredith cautiously approached and assured him that she could fix him, too, as he was the one who had taught her everything she knows. She wanted her children to grow up and know him. She wasn't ready to let him go yet, and neither were other people. He handed over the scalpel. He called her Ellis and said something was wrong with him. She guided him back to his room. He thought he was at Seattle Grace and asked for his interns so they could start rounding. He also said Adele would kill him if he was late for dinner again. Unable to bear watching his decline, Catherine left the room while Meredith and Maggie got Richard comfortable.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine continued to watch over him even though he did not recognize her, his cognitive function rapidly declining even further to the point of him being minimally responsive. After a few weeks, Catherine wanted to take Richard home despite his doctors' protest. As they tried to get him in a wheelchair, which angered him, he revealed he had numb extremities. The EMG showed impaired nerve function, which wasn't consistent with the tentative diagnosis of dementia. They then went to do a nerve biopsy but Andrew interrupted the procedure, thinking he had found he diagnosis: cobalt poisoning from his hip replacement three years ago. As cobalt wasn't included in the standard heavy metal panel, Meredith drew another blood sample, which confirmed the diagnosis. Link operated and replaced the hip, removing the toxic sludge from his body. Richard woke up in the ICU after a while with Maggie by his side. He recognized her and answered some questions correctly. His tremor was also gone. Catherine then came in and said she was having nurses bring her a bed so she could spend the night. However, he didn't want her there as he perfectly remembered her not standing by him as he got fired and her buying his hospital just to spite him. He ordered her to get out.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nRichard is a determined teacher and boss who cares a lot for his personnel and the hospital itself.\n\nHis private life is devoted to his professional one. Without his job, he doesn't have a real reason to live, especially after his wife,\ua[[Adele Webber]], died. He was a loving husband towards her, despite the fact that he cheated on her and put his duties in the hospital above everything.\n\nHe has always cared for\ua[[Meredith Grey]]\uaas if he was her father. He decided to mentor her personally to make sure she became a great general surgeon.\ua\n\n\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\n[[File:xEllisRichardFlashback.jpg|thumb|left|px|Richard leaves Ellis.]]Richard met [[Ellis Grey]] when [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] was three. During their residency at Seattle Grace, he had an affair with her, although both were married. Although Ellis left her husband, Richard could not bring himself to leave his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]]. He would learn decades later, however, that Adele had known about the affair all along and stayed with him anyway. He later confessed that he ended the affair because he believed that Ellis deserved better and that he had too much baggage.\n\nWhen Dr. [[Maggie Pierce]] began to work at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], she told Richard that she was adopted and [[Ellis Grey]] was her birth mom, leaving Richard to suspect that he is her biological father.\n\n[[Adele Webber]]\nRichard proposed to Adele on New Year's and got married the Valentine's Day after. They got married when Adele was .\n\nAdele asked him to retire, forcing him to choose between his career or their marriage. He tried to skirt around it, but Adele, tired of waiting, made her choice\uaand left him. He moved out and was sleeping in his office for a short time, but later had a room at the same hotel as [[Callie Torres|Callie]]. After learning of Ellis's illness, Richard had been visiting her regularly, but upon deciding to attempt a reconciliation with Adele realized that he could no longer continue his emotional affair with Ellis. He attempted\uato patch things up with his wife but was stunned to find out that she had\uaapparently moved on to someone else.\n\nAdele was admitted to the hospital and was discovered, first by Addison and later by Richard, to be pregnant (at  years old). Though he believed the father to be the man Adele insinuated to be seeing months earlier, Richard stayed by Adele's side as she was treated, though complications later arose and she lost the baby. Adele later admitted to Richard that the baby, which was a boy, was actually his. After this tragedy, Richard and Adele decided to give their marriage another try.\n\nRichard and Adele declared that his work was the reason that their marriage had failed. He started living on Derek's property in his own trailer and began to repair his life as a divorc\ue.\n\nAfter months living apart, Richard decided to move back home. He admitted to Adele that he made a mistake  years ago but he's a good man, and he doesn't treat her as she deserves, putting his foot down. Adele commented, \"It's about time\" and allowed Richard to return home.<ref>[[Freedom, Part ]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Adele moves into Roseridge.|xpx]]\n\nAfter Adele was placed in [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]] after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and finding a new love, [[Allan]], Richard began to date [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]].\n\nAdele later passed away of a heart attack on the day of [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey's]] wedding.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\n[[Catherine Fox]]\nRichard and Catherine maintained a\uaflirtatious relationship throughout her first two visits to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital|Seattle Grace Mercy West]]. He almost accompanied her to a medical ball, but he realized he needed to be with his\ua[[Adele Webber|wife]] in her time of need. By the time of the medical boards, Adele's condition had\uadeteriorated to the point she did not recognize Richard anymore and had begun \"dating\" another man. This was when Catherine and Richard began their sexual relationship. When Adele died, Richard pushed away Catherine and her efforts at a relationship. They have since reconciled and see each other on an irregular basis, but are serious. Richard was planning on proposing to Catherine, but a huge argument about Cristina losing the Harper Avery Award changed his mind. After some time apart, Richard professed his feelings for Catherine and subsequently, they reconciled. Richard and Catherine later showed differing views on marriage just as he was about to propose to her again. Some time later, Catherine proposed to Richard in front of the whole hospital, to which he agreed.\n\nThey faced difficulties in their marriage after Richard was fired, as he said that she had just sat there and let him be fired. He began to work at Pac-North, which upset Catherine. They eventually decided to separate, and at a dinner where they were supposed to break the news to Jackson and Maggie, they had another argument. This ended in Catherine purchasing Pac-North. Richard first refused to be hired back to Grey Sloan because of what happened with Catherine, but he eventually came back.\ua\n\nDuring his cobalt poisoning, Catherine stayed by his side, as he didn't remember what she had done. After Richard was cured, he demanded that she leave.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nRichard attended both of Bailey's weddings. In , Miranda became an intern at\ua[[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Richard discovered her talent when she correctly diagnosed a patient after  months of unnecessary surgeries.\ua\n\nWhen he was a drunk, she was the only one that managed to make him admit it and sign the papers to go into rehab instead of signing the papers for early retirement.\n\nHe was the one who recommended\uathat she be the new board member after Cristina's departure, and he also recommended her to be chief when [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] stepped down. \n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nRichard and Derek were good friends. They first met during Derek's residency when Richard was one of his teachers. When Richard separated from [[Adele Webber|his wife]], Derek allowed Richard to park his trailer on his land and live there.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[File:RichardandMeredithForgiveEachOther.jpg|thumb|left|Richard and Meredith forgiving each other|xpx]]Richard and Meredith share a father-daughter-esque relationship. He met her during his residency when Meredith was a little girl. In the recent past, after Meredith started her surgical residency, the relationship between the two of them was a rocky one. For quite some time, Meredith couldn't forgive Richard that he had forced her parents apart and acted unprofessionally and disrespectfully towards him. Also, Richard couldn't forgive himself for not standing up for her and never doing anything about the fact that Ellis was neglecting her. Also, he couldn't detach the feelings he had for Meredith's mother,\ua[[Ellis Grey]], from the feelings he had for her. After an intervention by [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], they forgave each other.\n\nAfter a gunman, by the name of [[Gary Clark]] entered the hospital and started shooting people, Meredith offered herself to him, stating that she was the closest thing to a daughter Richard had.\n\nAfter the shooting, they maintained a good relationship until his accident during [[Super Storm|the super storm]]. In the aftermath of this accident, Meredith learned that she was Richard's healthcare proxy and that his life depended on her decisions. Meredith made the decision to have them operate and he woke up from his coma. After waking up, Richard told Meredith that he had only made her his medical proxy because he thought she had the guts to let him die. This revelation estranged them for a while, but subsequently, Richard apologized and they both returned to a close relationship.\n\n\nHe was the [[Chief of Surgery]] at Seattle Grace and was formerly a mentor to [[Derek Shepherd]] and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] during their residency.\n\nThere are continuity errors regarding where exactly Richard built his career; at one point, he states that with the exception of his fellowship, he spent his entire career at Seattle Grace. However, it is also established that he both taught and befriended Addison and Derek, presumably in New York (the majority of references within the show, as well as additional sources, indicate that a good portion of Richard's career was spent in Manhattan, rather than Seattle). He also has a diploma from Northwestern University. \n\nA board member regards Richard as the best surgeon in the hospital and is demonstrated on the occasion in the robotics lab where he takes the course as a \"refresher\", and he pits himself against [[Cristina Yang]], losing in the first few tasks. In the last task, performing a minor operation, Richard manages to complete the surgery with his eyes closed, while Cristina struggles to get ahead. When asked how he managed to do so, he claims muscle memory - he is so used to these procedures knows how to perform the surgery with his eyes closed.\n\nRichard had planned to retire and recommended [[Preston Burke]] as his successor, but after the secret of Burke's tremor and cover-up came out, that plan was put to a stand-still. Nevertheless, he has told the hospital board of his retirement and has yet to name his successor; Derek, Preston, Addison, and Mark all eagerly clamoring for the post. Richard eventually chose Derek, but Derek tells him that Richard should remain chief.\n\nIn an attempt to move back home, Richard begins to delegate some of his work to other staff with responsibilities, such as the [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]], at the time being [[Callie Torres]], but as she was slightly unaware of what to do exactly, [[Miranda Bailey]] eventually replaces her, reducing Richard's burden. To assist with this further, he enlists\ua [[George O'Malley]] to become the chief's intern to assist with some of his day to day duties, such as passing messages, phone calls, charting, pre-op and post-op patients amongst other things, until George finally had enough after learning he failed his intern exam by  point.\n\nAfter the death of O'Malley and throughout the merger with Mercy West, Richard comes under a massive amount of stress. He makes a mistake on a patient that brings to the attention of Bailey that something is wrong. Eventually, he takes Meredith under his tutelage where she finally figures out that he had started to drink again. Meredith eventually tells Derek and Derek brings it to the attention of the board who force Richard to resign as chief and his responsibilities as a doctor; Derek takes over his position as chief of surgery.\n\nAfter a numerous number of days sober, Richard finally returns to being a [[General Surgery|general surgery]] [[Attending|attending]] under Shepherd. He is the doctor that was on the case of [[Gary Clark]]'s wife and did her surgery. She did not recover however and died leaving Clark with a vendetta against him. Clark later returns and begins to shoot people, mainly surgeons, in the hospital. Webber was not present at the time but once he hears what is going on he finds a way into the hospital and confronts Clark, who ultimately commits suicide.\n\nDerek resigns as chief surgeon, leaving Richard as interim chief until the board agrees to let him come back full-time as the chief of surgery. After a day of recalling his old procedures with [[Ellis Grey]], he began going through her journals again. When he found the trick he was looking for, Richard was encouraged to try to expand her findings on islet cell transplantation, which was stopped because of her Alzheimer's. He initiated a clinical trial to cure type  diabetes through a device that contains insulin-producing islet cells. He even tried to get Meredith to participate, which she ultimately turned down because she was dedicated to Derek's Alzheimer's trial.\n\nBefore he could get the approval or a waiver from the FDA, Richard tried the device and procedure on Clara Greene, who was in a hypoglycemic coma. Eventually, it was approved. Richard, with [[Jackson Avery]] as his assistant, began trying out the \"artificial pancreas\" on humans, as well as mice.\n\nRichard took the fall for Meredith's tampering of a clinical trial for Alzheimer's which could help Adele. He resigned as Chief and helped [[Owen Hunt]] obtain the job as his successor. He has since been a senior general surgery attending. Richard passed the clinical trial onto Dr. Bailey.\n\nRichard invested money to buy\ua[[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], which was later renamed\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. As Richard is a part-owner of [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], he has a seat on the board as a member.\ua\n\nAfter he had recovered from his accident, [[Owen Hunt]] made him [[Resident#Program Director|director of the residency program]].\n\nAfter Owen quit, Richard was named interim chief of surgery until they could replace him.\n\nBecause he didn't want to be the Chief anymore, he recommended Miranda Bailey for the job. She was judged up against a candidate chosen by Catherine Avery, [[Tracy McConnell]], and was ultimately named Chief of Surgery.\n\nAfter reviewing the residency records and finding several questionable calls, Catherine Avery made Bailey hire a new Director of the residency program, Dr. Eliza Minnick. This upset Richard, who believed Bailey had betrayed him. Eventually, he started to work alongside Minnick with the residents. This ended when after the hospital fire, Bailey fired Minnick, reinstating Richard in his function.\n\nBailey fired him upon discovering the role he played in covering up Meredith's insurance fraud. He initially got a job working for the health app Pronto Health Pro, but quit soon. He interviewed for the Chief of Surgery job at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]], the last ranked hospital of Seattle since its new investors were looking for someone with vision and experience to turn the place around. However, he wasn't hired because of his approaching retirement. He then made Alex interview and when he got the job, made him hire him as an attending general surgeon there.\n\n\n*He is a recovering alcoholic.\n*When he drinks, he drinks vodka.\n*He has driven several Mercedes Benz E-Class Models through the years\n*His favorite cake is red velvet with cream cheese icing.<ref>[[Hope for the Hopeless]], x</ref>\n*He claims to be strong at history and geography trivia.\n*In , Webber won a plaque for \"best doctors in America\".\n*His email address is [[rwebber@seattlegrace.com]].\n*He taught a painful lesson to Addison about getting to close to her patients by giving her a patient who would eventually die.

After bringing a patient to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], he got a job working there but eventually resigned when he moved to Malibu with\ua[[Megan Hunt]].\n\n\n\nNathan was born in New Zealand. At the age of , he moved to Seattle.\n\n\nOwen and Nathan became doctors together, including their field training. They became like brothers, and Nathan really trusted him. <ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref> Through Owen, Nathan met [[Megan Hunt]], with whom he fell in love. They started a relationship, but they both cheated on each other. While they were working as field surgeons in Iraq, Megan found out he had cheated and called her brother<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref>, who urged her to get away from Nathan as soon as possible.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], x</ref>\n\n\nThat same day, Nathan and Megan needed to transport a patient from the field, but there was only room in the chopper for one of them. It was going to be an ugly ride through an unprotected airspace, so he wanted to go. Megan objected as she wanted to get away from Nathan and pointed out it was her patient. After a fight, he let her go as he would've done the same thing had the patient been his. The helicopter never arrived at its destination and disappeared without a trace. Megan's disappearance started the feud between Owen and Nathan, as Owen blamed him for it.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref> After her disappearance, Nathan stayed around for a while to look for her, while Owen returned to Seattle soon after her disappearance.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile working with April, he and the other doctors called her \"''The Machine''\" because she worked through everything and made others want to work harder. Because of April, Nathan came to Seattle with [[Kamal Aboud]], who needed surgery to remove tumors from his hands. Jackson initially refused and Nathan started calling around to find another surgeon. While doing so, he encountered Owen, who urged to him to leave. Since all other surgeons refused, Jackson decided to amputate, but changed his mind mid-procedure and saved Kamal's hands. At the end of the day, Nathan went to Joe's with April and Bailey, who wanted to hear war stories.<ref>[[The Me Nobody Knows]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing their night out, Bailey offered Nathan a job at the hospital. She neglected to consult with anyone before hiring Nathan, thus surprising Maggie and Owen to see him at work. At the end of his first day, he asked Meredith to go grab a drink together, but she declined, as she decided to hate Nathan because Owen did so.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref> The news of the feud between Owen and Nathan spread quickly around the hospital, and rumors of possible causes soon followed. Nathan focused on his job and ignored Owen's constant attempts to thwart him. When Owen's mother showed up at the hospital for [[John Finch|John]], Nathan saw her and they hugged. Owen later told him to stay away from his family, to which Nathan responded he viewed [[Evelyn Hunt|Evelyn]] as his family, too. Owen then punched him and told him they were not his family. Afterwards, Nathan went to Joe's and bought Amelia a drink.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nOwen continued to interfere with Nathan doing his job, even going as far as to throw him off a shared case. Nathan hung out with April at the bar and told her how he met Owen, and that he never hated him. However, when the patient was in distress, Owen specifically requested Nathan for help, and their colleagues witnessed how amazingly in sync they were able to work, anticipating each other's moves and knowing what to do without any conversation. While scrubbing out, the men began yelling at each other again.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref> While working together with Meredith, she acted rather hostile when he tried to smoothen things with personal questions, but at the end of the day asked him about his deal with Owen. Since she only knew about Megan's helicopter disappearing, Nathan told her that he had wanted to board the chopper, but Megan insisted on going herself.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Owen confronted him again about clashing opinions over a shared patient, Nathan flat-out told him to find someone else to hate in order to get over his guilt. He reminded Owen that while he stayed to look for Megan, Owen gave up and returned to Seattle.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref> Not long after, Owen, Nathan, and Meredith got on an ambulance to retrieve a heart. Nathan learned that Amelia was an alcoholic and confessed he bought her a drink. Owen started to yell at him, but Meredith broke up the fight. Later that day, Owen told Nathan bad things happen around him, and he told Nathan he knew about the cheating. He told Nathan he couldn't come to the hospital and pretend to be a hero and fool everyone, as Owen would not let that happen.<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref> After Maggie became aware of the reason of Owen's severe disliking of Nathan, Nathan opened up to Maggie and told her that despite Owen telling everyone he's a liar, the only thing he did was leave pieces out of the story since he considered those to be just for him and Megan. He admitted to having made a big mistake, but he's paid for it ever since it happened.<ref>[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]], x</ref>\n\nThe feud seemingly came to a truce on the day of Owen and Amelia's wedding. Since April, Owen's best man, ended up in the hospital, Nathan drove down to the church to give Owen the rings. Owen thanked him and invited him to stay for the ceremony.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Meredith had a bad day, he confronted her about it in the parking lot, realizing it was all about Amelia and how she was living the life that Derek didn't get to live. They started arguing and she suddenly jumped him when he asked her what she wanted. They ended up having sex in her car, four times.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\uaWhen Nathan brought it up a few weeks later, Meredith stated she didn't want him to get too attached to her. He claimed he knew they were just friends who had sex, but during Owen and Amelia's wedding, he smilingly looked at her, indicating he started to feel more for her.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> After the wedding, Nathan continuously chased Meredith, hoping to be friends or something more, but she repeatedly rejected him due to knowing her sister, [[Maggie Pierce]], would get hurt. However, after accidentally meeting up on a plane and getting closer, the two became a couple.\n\n\nAfter Meredith told Nathan that Megan had been found and was being transported to Seattle, Nathan rushed to the hospital to be reunited with his long-lost fianc\uee. Nathan attempted to restart his relationship with Megan by re-proposing to her, but she turned him down because she believed that he was still in love with Meredith. Nathan subsequently tried to get back together with Meredith, but she told him to make a grand gesture to win Megan's affection because it's not every day that people gets a second chance with a lost loved one. Nathan traveled overseas and brought back [[Farouk Shami Hunt|Farouk]], Megan's son, who was stuck in Iraq, proving his love for Megan. Nathan and Megan then got back together and [[Megan and Nathan's House|moved]]\uato Malibu together, resulting in Nathan's resignation from Grey Sloan.\n\n\nIn early , Nathan and Megan split up after the sitting at home during the pandemic made them realize they were not happy together. As soon as they agreed to break up, Nathan signed back up with his NGO and he shipped out two days later.\n\n\nWhen Nathan first came to the hospital with [[Kamal Aboud]], he seemed like a very nice guy. He and April get along very well, and Kamal deeply cared about him. Owen, however, feels completely different about Nathan. He resents Nathan and doesn't even want to be near him. He passed on his hatred to Meredith, who began to notice that Nathan overstepped his boundaries and made rash decisions, like when he decided to pull a spike out of a man's chest. This is likely due to the fact that Nathan had been doing relief work in the Middle East for a long time, a place where he had to take initiative, and was not yet adjusted to the ways of a real world hospital.\n\n\n\n[[Megan Hunt]]\nNathan was romantically involved with Megan Hunt, Owen's younger sister. One day, while working in a field unit, they had to transport a patient across unprotected airspace, with the chopper only having room for one of them. After some fighting, Nathan allowed Megan to step on board, as the patient was hers. The chopper, however, disappeared without a trace, which lead to Owen blaming him for her supposed death hence their current feud.\n\nHowever, Owen revealed to Meredith that Nathan was never near the chopper with Megan. He revealed that Nathan cheated on Megan with another woman.<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref> Nathan later confirmed this when confronted by [[Maggie Pierce]] and said that everything he told Meredith was true; he just left out the part about the cheating because he considers it to be only for himself and Megan. He does not owe anyone an explanation of this, and Maggie agrees.\n\nWhile Owen was taking care of baby Harriet, he and Nathan had a conversation about kids. Owen asked if Nathan and Megan ever discussed having children, and Nathan said that they did talk about it. Megan wanted to name their child Bernard, which he and Owen shared a laugh about. Nathan sadly went on to say that the universe had other plans for Megan.<ref>[[Both Sides Now]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Megan was found and brought back to Seattle, Nathan proposed to her to rekindle their romance. However, she turned him down because she thought that he was still in love with Meredith. After getting advice from Meredith, Nathan made a big gesture for Megan by bringing her son back from Iraq. Megan finally believed that Nathan wanted to be with her, and they both departed Seattle to begin a life together in California.\n\nAfter a few years filled with therapy to work on their relationship, it ended up one of the casualties of the pandemic. They realized they were a couple that enjoyed high highs and low lows and staring at the same four walls for a year while people were dying around them made them realize they were not meant to live together.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nNathan and Meredith were initially at odds, with her disliking him out of loyalty for Owen. Due to Owen's stories, she began to notice he was prone to making rash medical decisions, and their opinions quite often differed. However, she has shown to be able to put her dislike aside so it won't affect patients, or when Nathan told her his side of the story. When Meredith had a bad day, he confronted her about it in the parking lot. They started arguing and ended up having sex in her car.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\uaIt happened four times, but Meredith didn't want him to get too attached to her. He claimed he knew they were just friends who had sex, but during Owen and Amelia's wedding, he smilingly looked at her, indicating he had started to feel more for her.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nLater at the wedding, Nathan and Meredith flirted and he asked her to dance, only for Maggie to interrupt and dance with him, leaving Meredith to watch the two. Nathan continued to try to get closer to Meredith, and although she liked him, she kept brushing him off as she knew Maggie liked him too. Finally, Nathan showed up at Meredith's house, verbally confirming his feelings for her. Meredith lied to him, saying she didn't return the feelings, out of consideration for Maggie.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\uaMeredith also warned Nathan that Maggie was going to ask him out, which Nathan believed to be the reason she was rejecting his pursuits. Nathan still wanted to be more than friends with Meredith, but out of loyalty to her sister, she continued to ignore him.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\uaMeredith asked Nathan to a dinner date, but cancelled on him last minute as she had to care for Maggie, who was grieving after the death of\ua[[Diane Pierce]], her mother.<ref>[[What's Inside]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Nathan and Meredith at a press conference]]\nMeredith and Nathan found themselves sitting next to each other on a plane, both heading to a conference. Meredith went to the bathroom, but Nathan followed her, intent on talking to her about their situation. They ended up having sex. After the plane landed and passengers were tended to, Nathan proposed that they get a hotel room and Meredith accepted.<ref>[[In the Air Tonight]], x</ref> A few weeks later, Meredith walked out of the hospital while holding hands with Nathan, indicating they are officially a couple.<ref>[[Leave It Inside]], x</ref>\n\nWith Megan returning, Meredith and Nathan's relationship was rocky. Nathan proposed to Megan, but she turned him down, believing he was still in love with Meredith. He told Meredith about that at the end of the day, but she just walked away from him.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref> Meredith avoided Nathan out of anger, but when they later had a conversation, she revealed that she felt he was betraying her by not getting back together with Megan. When Nathan and Meredith had first started dating, they bonded over losing a loved one. Meredith believed that Nathan must seize the opportunity to have a second chance with Megan. If he didn't, then he wasn't the man Meredith thought he was. Nathan eventually moved to Malibu with Megan, effectively ending his relationship with Meredith for good.\n\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nNathan met Owen and Megan in med school and became friends with Owen, who became like a brother to him. Owen was supposed to be his best man at his wedding with Megan. They were torn apart, however, after Megan disappeared in the field with the helicopter she was on and Owen began blaming Nathan for having allowed her to step on board. They did not see each other for years until Nathan came to the hospital with April Kepner. When he was hired as a cardiothoracic surgeon, Owen quickly began to bad-mouth him and punched him upon his notion that the two of them shared a family. They continued to share parts of the story, confusing their colleagues. On the day of Owen's wedding, Nathan brought the rings to the church since April ended up in the hospital. Owen appreciated the gesture and invited him to stay for the ceremony, thus marking a truce in the feud.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\n[[Evelyn Hunt]]\nNathan and Evelyn appear to be on good terms, with her hugging him warmly upon meeting him again after his arrival to Seattle, and him calling her \"ma\". It seems that she, unlike her son, has forgiven Nathan for whatever part he had to play in her daughter's fate.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref> At Owen and Amelia's wedding, Nathan sat next to her while she admired her soon-to-be daughter-in-law.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nDuring their time working together in Jordan, he became close with April Kepner, whom he often calls \"Keps\". They remain good friends at Grey Sloan, as seen when they were playing darts at Joe's and talking to each other about their personal problems.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nMaggie was surprised to find out that Bailey hired someone for her department without consulting<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref>, but she soon came to realize Nathan was talented and not a bad guy. After the panel convened for [[Ben Warren|Ben's]] actions on [[Gretchen McKay]], Nathan noticed Maggie was acting differently and he figured she heard Owen's stories about him. He told her that everything he had told Meredith was true, but he admitted to leaving out some pieces that he considered just for him and Megan. Maggie understood and went back to treating him normally.<ref>[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]], x</ref>\uaOver time, Maggie developed a crush on him, but Nathan didn't notice it and just maintained a pleasant professional relationship with her. Pierce asked Nathan out, but Meredith had warned him about this and had told him to say no. Riggs did so due to his growing feelings for Meredith, but felt bad hurting Maggie.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nNathan and Amelia maintain a professional relationship. After he bought her a drink, he became aware of her romantic relationship with Owen and once offered to go talk to a patient's family without her so she could make her date with Owen.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref> Nathan appears to keep a distance from her in his personal life since she's close to Owen, so he figured she'd have formed her conclusions about him already.\n\n\nRiggs is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]], formerly working at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].

Our job is to build a boat strong enough that, when they decide to, they can get back to us safely.|'''Evelyn Hunt''' to '''[[Amelia Shepherd]]'''}}\n\n'''Evelyn Hunt''' is the mother of [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] and [[Megan Hunt]].\n\n\n\nEvelyn was in the military and served in the Vietnam War. Afterwards, she settled down in Seattle with her husband and had two children: Owen and Megan. The family lived only five miles from Seattle Grace Hospital. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n\nShe is shown hugging Owen after finding out he was back from Iraq. He did not want to tell his mom he was back until Cristina convinced him to see her. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\n\nShe attended her son's wedding to [[Cristina Yang]]. ''(\"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\")''\n\n\nAfter living as a widow for over thirty years, Evelyn met [[John Finch]] at a writers group. John was fascinated by her stories about her time in the service, as he had himself been in the navy. The two eventually fell in love, but Evelyn chose not to tell her son about John just yet.\n\nOne morning, however, Evelyn had been feeling dizzy and as she was taking a shower, she fell through the glass door. She was admitted to GSMH, John by her side, much to her son's surprise. Owen was concerned that John was only conning her, and seeing her son's harsh reaction, Evelyn broke up with John. However, she then began suffering from severe abdominal pain, startling both Owen and John, who refused to leave without knowing that she would be fine.\n\nEvelyn's pains turned out to stem from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and she was rushed into surgery. Had she not already been in the hospital, the rupture would've been fatal, but since she was, the surgery was successful and she was awake and stable afterwards. She then reunited with John, whom Owen had asked to stay, having seen that John was genuinely in love with his mother. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a fire broke out on Mt. Baker, John was called to the scene, where he was seriously injured. Evelyn came to the hospital to be with him. She sat by his bedside after surgery and was told he'd make a full recovery. She was shocked to see [[Nathan Riggs]] at the hospital, but greeted him warmly. She then told Meredith the history between Owen and Nathan. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\n\nShe attended Owen and Amelia's wedding. At the wedding, she said Amelia looked stunning. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Megan was found in Iraq and brought back to the United States, Evelyn came to see her in the hospital. She wasn't sure about Megan having the more radical surgery, but she was supportive of Megan's decision. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n\nMegan got Evelyn and Teddy together in order to talk to them about Owen and Amelia's marriage. They all agreed that it didn't seem like a stable marriage. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Amelia struggled with what to do with Betty, Owen mentioned that his mother ruled with an iron fist, so Amelia called her to get help. Evelyn assured her that she should drug test her and ground her. She said it sounded like Betty needed a mother, so she should be one. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day Owen and Teddy were supposed to get married, Evelyn came to their house to get the house ready for it. When Owen called and lied that he got called into a last-minute surgery, she helped take down the decorations and informed Teddy, whom Owen didn't call. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the [[COVID- Pandemic]], Evelyn took care of her son's two children while he and Teddy worked at the hospital. During this time, she and Leo made up a game in which she wrapped him in pillows and he pretended he was sleeping on a cloud. ''(\"[[In My Life]]\")''\n\nWhen there was a leftover vaccine from personnel vaccinations at the hospital in January , Owen called up his mother. After he administered the first dose, Evelyn worried she had stolen someone's vaccine but Owen assured her it would have ended up in the trash otherwise. Teddy arrived moments later to witness the event. Evelyn told her she could administer the second dose. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nEvelyn came to her son's wedding to Teddy along with her daughter and grandson. The ceremony started, but before the priest could finish, he was hit by a couple on a tandem bicycle when they lost control during a bike race. Despite the interruption, Teddy and Owen married later that day at [[Emerald City Bar]] with their friends and family present. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Megan learned that a teen in Tacoma had been declared brain dead and his parents had decided to donate his organs, including his heart, which UNOS had directed to Farouk, Evelyn came to the hospital to stay with Megan while Farouk had his surgery. Hours later, they were still waiting in Farouk's hospital room, unaware that Owen, Teddy, and Cormac had been in an accident on their way back from retrieving the heart. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\n\nLate Husband\nHer husband, Owen and Megan's father, died  years prior to her hospitalization. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n[[John Finch]]\nEvelyn met John at a writers group, having began to write stories about her time in military service. John was fascinated about her stories and the two began talking and bonding, eventually starting to meet outside the group as well. According to Evelyn, it took her weeks to realize that he was dating her, and she was astonished that a young man like John was interested in a widow like her. However, she had also fallen for him, and when he kissed her, she felt like they were the same age, all the years between them melting away. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n\n[[Owen Hunt]] is her son. She also has a daughter, [[Megan Hunt|Megan]], who went missing when a helicopter carrying her disappeared in the battlefield. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")'' She was believed to be lost or dead in the Iraqi desert for ten years before the Army informed Owen that Megan had been found. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")'' For those ten years, Megan was held prisoner by rebel forces, but treated well. Evelyn has three grandchildren: [[Farouk Shami Hunt]], [[Leo Hunt]], and [[Allison Hunt]].\n\n\n*She has a cat.<ref>[[With or Without You]], x</ref>\n*It is implied that Evelyn Hunt was a scrub nurse either prior to her military service or during as she responded to [[Meredith Grey|Dr. Grey]] regarding her daughter's surgery, \"Well, I admit I've been out of the O.R. for a while...\"<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n*She lives only a few miles away from [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].<ref>[[Here's to Future Days]], x</ref>\n*Father Patrick is her favorite priest.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nMrs.Hunt.png|[[Here's to Future Days]]\nMrs.Hunt.png|[[With You I'm Born Again]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[With or Without You]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[Family Affair]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[Break Down the House]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[Get Off on the Pain]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[Momma Knows Best]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[Put on a Happy Face]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[Here Comes the Sun]]\nxEvelynHunt.png|[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Evelyn Hunt Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Evelyn Hunt]]\n[[de:Evelyn Hunt]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hunt, Evelyn}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Meredith would bring the doll with her to the hospital. Years later, an adult, and now a doctor, Meredith uncovered the doll while she and Derek were unpacking boxes in their house, which was previously owned and inhabited by her mother and father before their divorce, and by her mother after, until Meredith was forced to place her mother in [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]], due to Ellis suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's. The doll brought up old memories for Meredith, along with a renewed attachment to the doll that resulted in adult Meredith bringing it to work with her one day. Upon recognizing an Anatomy Jane doll and her own remembered fondness for her own as a child, [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] allowed Meredith to scrub into surgery that day on a patient being treated for an inoperable tumor. During the surgery, it was obvious that [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] was quite disturbed, and also feeling a little guilty, at the sight of the doll, as he had been reminded of a young Meredith craving her mother's attention and love, yet not getting it since Ellis was not only very focused on her surgical career but also because he and Ellis were having an affair when they were both interns and residents. \n\nMeredith's parents had a troubled marriage, though part of this was due to [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]] spending too much time working and normal everyday problems. But a large part was due to the fact that for years, Ellis had been involved in an affair with one of her colleagues and best friends, [[Richard Webber]]. Their marital issues proved too great, and eventually, [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]] left the home when Meredith was five years old. He tried to visit her on several occasions, but he got nowhere. Eventually, he stopped seeing his daughter and subsequently started a new family with his new wife, [[Susan Grey]], and had two children.\n\nWhen Thatcher left Ellis, she continued her relationship with Webber, although he still had a wife, Adele. Although Richard tried to conceal his relationship with Ellis, Adele always knew, so if she was in their company, she would just play with Meredith. Eventually, Richard broke off his relationship with Ellis, as he felt he was being the better man, by walking away from Ellis, with Meredith only meters away, riding on a carousel. Meredith vaguely remembered her mother's pregnancy with Webber's child after he broke it off. In the memory, Ellis made it clear that she did not want to even look at the child. Shortly thereafter, Ellis accepted a fellowship opportunity at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She relocated to [[Massachusetts]] with Meredith, and Thatcher lost all contact with his daughter. As an adult, her only childhood memory of Thatcher was giving her cereal in the morning.[[Image:YoungMeredith.png|thumb|left|px|[[Time Has Come Today|Meredith as a child.]]]]\n\nIn the th grade, her English class had to read ''Romeo & Juliet.'' For extra credit, their teacher Mrs. Snyder made them act out all the parts. A boy named Sal Scafarillo was chosen for Romeo, and all the girls were jealous of Meredith, who was chosen for Juliet. But Meredith was not happy, and she complained to her teacher that Juliet was an idiot because she had fallen for the one man she knew she could never have. Then she blamed fate for her own bad decision. She told her that if Juliet was stupid enough to fall for the enemy, drink a bottle of poison and go to sleep in a mausoleum, then she deserved whatever she got. Therefore, at the age of , she was very clear that love, like life, was about making choices. Meredith later described her high school years to Cristina by saying, \"I wore a lot of black. Had the whole angry pink hair thing going on. Wouldn't have been caught dead at prom.\"\n\nShe went to college at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], and despite excessive drinking and partying, she graduated. Following her graduation, Ellis suggested that Meredith find another direction in her life, not being convinced that her daughter had what it took to survive medical school and make it in the surgical world. Following an argument about Meredith's future, Meredith spent two months traveling in [[Europe]] with her best friend [[Sadie Harris]], who also hated Ellis. But during that time, Meredith's mother Ellis Grey was diagnosed with early-onset [[Medical Glossary#A|Alzheimer's disease]] and placed into a nursing home in Seattle. Ellis's diagnosis gave Meredith the push she needed to go to medical school. After graduating from medical school, Meredith moved back to Seattle from Boston and into her childhood home in order to begin her internship at Seattle Grace. Meredith was the only one who knew about her mother's condition outside the nursing home staff, whose personnel were bound by contract to keep Ellis's condition confidential. Ellis also made Meredith promise not to tell anyone.\n[[File:Anatomy Jane.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith's \"Anatomy Jane\" doll.]]\nCristina later helped \"diagnose\" Meredith as having a case of \"severe abandonment issues,\" as the cause of her relationship problems with Derek, due to the fact that Thatcher left her, when she was a child, that she had to suddenly leave her childhood home when she was five, and that Ellis was absent for most of her childhood, due to her work and the affair she was having with Richard.\n\n\nAfter having a one-night stand with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] without knowing that he was her boss, she and Derek began dating, initially discreetly. But soon Bailey, Meredith's resident, caught her and Derek together and made it her mission to make Meredith's life at work as miserable as possible, as she was involved with her boss, who was also Bailey's boss. Meredith soon learned that Derek was still married when his wife, [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]], came to Seattle to get Derek back. At first, Meredith was angry with Derek for not telling her, but she later admitted to still loving him and begged him to \"pick me, choose me, love me.\" When Addison handed him the divorce papers to end their relationship officially, Derek remained hesitant and soon after decided to stay with Addison, much to Meredith's dismay. Although the two constantly flirted and Derek still hinted at having feelings for her, they both agreed to remain friends, and Addison, too, attempted to be friends with Meredith.\n\nWhen Derek's best friend, [[Mark Sloan]], visited Seattle, he was quick to realize that Meredith was \"the one\" for Derek and tried to persuade Addison to stop fighting for her marriage as Meredith was Derek's, true love. Meanwhile, Meredith rescued a dog, [[Doc]], in an effort to move on, but after her housemates, Izzie Stevens and George, gave her an ultimatum to choose them or Doc, she gave the dog to Derek and Addison. Doc was taken to the vet and diagnosed with bone cancer. Meredith started to date Finn the vet, much to Derek's annoyance. Meredith dating Finn also caused Derek to end the friendship with Meredith and call her a whore.\n\nOn the night of the Seattle Grace Hospital Prom, Derek went with Addison, while Meredith went with Finn. The two soon after met with each other in an exam room where Derek confessed that he still loved her and they had sex. Addison discovered Meredith's underwear in Derek's pocket and the two finally agreed to divorce. Meredith, however, was still dating Finn and issued a contest between the two boys to see which she would settle with. She ultimately chose Derek and they reconciled. \n\n\n[[File:xDrowningmeredith.jpg|thumb|xpx|Derek saves Meredith from almost drowning in Elliot Bay.]]\nMeredith, Izzie, George, Alex, and Bailey went to the site of a massive [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] accident. After Meredith finished stabilizing a patient's badly wounded leg with the help of a little girl just by the water, the man panicked and pushed Meredith off the edge into the bay. Later, when Derek was shown Meredith's fate by the little girl, he jumped into the water and then retrieved a pale, seemingly lifeless Meredith. He tried to perform CPR in the ambulance, but she did not respond. The doctors all tried to revive her, but she flatlined. Then Meredith entered a state of limbo in her mind, where she interacted with deceased acquaintances like [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny]], [[Dylan Young]], [[Doc]], [[Bonnie Crasnoff]], [[Elizabeth Fallon|Liz Fallon]], and her own mother, [[Ellis Grey]]. Eventually, she left this state of limbo and came back to life slowly. Meredith recovered, but Derek remained concerned that Meredith was a good swimmer, and that perhaps she had not tried hard enough and had given up.<ref>[[Walk on Water]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen one of Derek's patients, [[Jen Harmon]], found out that Derek was going to propose to Meredith, the two started to become friends and she wanted to help with the proposal. When she died, Derek blamed himself for her death. He ended up quitting his job and he moved back into his trailer. Richard told Meredith later that day that Derek was going to propose to her. Later that night, Meredith went to the trailer to find Derek drunk and hitting empty beer cans into the woods with a baseball bat. They started to argue and Meredith said, \"I know there's a ring!\" Derek froze. Meredith then told him that the chief had told her about the ring and that she was not going to give up on them. Derek then hit the ring into the woods. The next time Meredith went to see Derek at the trailer, she told him Izzie had metastatic melanoma and that it spread to her liver, skin, and brain. And that he was the most qualified surgeon to remove the tumor. Derek later asked Meredith to marry him, but she rejected his proposal. Derek ended up going back to work and removed Izzie's brain tumor successfully. That night, Derek proposed to Meredith in the elevator, which was decorated with surgical scans from their past cases. This time, Meredith accepted.<ref>[[Elevator Love Letter]], x</ref> Izzie Stevens began to plan the wedding, but right before, Derek and Meredith decided to give the wedding to her and Alex Karev.<ref>[[What a Difference a Day Makes]], x</ref> Later, Derek and Meredith got married in the resident's lounge, on a blue Post-It note from Cristina Yang.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Meredith was treating a John Doe, who soon would be identified as [[George O'Malley]], he attempted to write on a pad before surgery but wasn't successful. While recovering in the ICU, he attempted again to write on Meredith's hand, and she soon realized that it was George after he traced \"\" on her hand multiple times. Meredith was alarmed and alerted the other doctors, who originally believed her when he was taken in for brain surgery. During George's brain surgery, his brain swelled and he was declared brain dead. Lexie thought it wasn't George because she didn't think he was tall enough, so Callie checked for a Texas-shaped birthmark on his hand, which she saw, confirming it was George.\n\n\nDuring the start of the merger with Mercy West Medical Center, Meredith was hospitalized from having donated a portion of her liver to her father, Thatcher Grey, since he was unable to be placed on the transplant list due to his alcoholism.<ref>[[Tainted Obligation]], x</ref> Richard's drinking escalated again, causing him to make an error during surgery which almost killed a patient, until Dr. Bailey stepped in, fixing the problem<ref>[[New History]], x</ref> and scheduling weekly followups with the patient to ensure he had no lasting effects.<ref>[[Blink]], x</ref> Richard's alcoholism led him to do one-on-one teaching sessions where he showed Meredith various surgical techniques and she discovered his drinking again.<ref>[[Holidaze]], x</ref> She kept this from Derek, but he became very angry with Meredith and made her tell him what was going on.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref> When Derek found out about the drinking, he reported Richard to the board, forcing him to either step down from surgery and go to rehab or retire. When he chose rehab, Derek was named the interim Chief of Surgery.<ref>[[State of Love and Trust]], x</ref>\n\n\nNear the end of their third year of residency, Meredith revealed to Cristina that she was pregnant. She also planned on telling Derek, but the mass shooting intervened. The husband of a deceased patient, [[Gary Clark]], entered the hospital and shot many people, killing many, including [[Reed Adamson|Dr. Reed Adamson]] and [[Charles Percy|Dr. Charles Percy]]. The hospital was placed in lockdown while the shooting occurred. Gary Clark also shot Derek in the chest while Meredith watched from afar. Cristina had to do his surgery herself after barring Meredith from the OR. When the shooter entered the OR, Meredith entered too and told him to shoot her. However, he ended up shooting Owen, though his injuries were comparatively minor. While tending to Owen's injury, Meredith suffered a miscarriage.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the shooting, all involved were made to go through a psych consult to be cleared for surgery. Meredith was the last one to be cleared. She was cleared by Dr. Andrew Perkins only after she admitted her pregnancy and miscarriage.\n\nDerek began speeding to cope with the trauma and was arrested several times for \"reckless endangerment.\" The only people that knew about Meredith's miscarriage were Cristina, Owen, and April. Meredith ended up leaving him in jail on the night of Cristina and Owen's wedding. The next day, angered at having been left in jail overnight, Derek had an argument with Meredith in the hospital hallway. Derek tried to calm Meredith down and Meredith admitted that she had been worried about him since he started speeding and the only time she got relief was when he was in jail because she knew he was safe. She then told him about her miscarriage. Derek and Meredith kissed and hugged, and Derek agreed to drive more carefully from that point on.\n\n\nThe couple had recently been told that Meredith had a hostile uterus and conceiving a child would be difficult. Meredith and Derek met Zola when she was brought to the hospital for a spina bifida operation as part of Alex's program. Derek immediately bonded with Zola and suggested adoption. Meredith took a little longer to bond with Zola, but eventually, she was unable to avoid falling in love with the child. However, Derek found out that Meredith had tampered with his Alzheimer's trial just as the couple was granted temporary custody of Zola. When the social worker on their case, Janet, discovered that Meredith and Derek weren't living together and that Meredith had been fired, red flags were raised in the system. Fearing that she would lose Zola, Meredith hid with Zola in the basement of the hospital for  hours. Zola was taken away from them for a time, during which Meredith and Derek rekindled their relationship. They were given a date to see a judge about the adoption after Alex went to the judge directly. That date was subsequently canceled and Janet told them that it was unlikely that it would end in their favor and suggested that they move on. But the decision did end in their favor, and Janet brought Zola to them, finalizing the adoption.\n\n\nAt the end of her residency, Meredith, along with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], was involved in a plane crash on the way to Boise to help in a conjoined twins case. Lexie died due to a part of the plane crushing her, and Meredith was horrified and mourned. The plane crash also led to Mark's death, Arizona's loss of her leg, and Derek's severely damaged nerves in his hand.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nThe group ended up spending four days out in the woods before they were found and airlifted to [[Boise Memorial Hospital]], where they were treated before being sedated and flown back to Seattle.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nAll the survivors of the plane crash filed a lawsuit against the plane company. Their attorney informed the survivors that they would be pursuing action against the hospital instead of the plane company since the hospital put them on the plane. This alarmed the doctors. However, they decided to go ahead with the lawsuit, because Derek went to see the plane wreckage and believed if they settled, they wouldn't properly investigate what went wrong so it couldn't happen again to someone else.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors went to trial and were awarded $ million each. Callie decided that their win should be celebrated, and Meredith, Derek, Callie, Arizona, and Cristina all went to dinner to celebrate, where Meredith revealed that she was pregnant.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\nDuring Meredith's pregnancy, [[Alana Cahill|Dr. Alana Cahill]] was brought to the hospital to assess efficiency, as the plane crash verdict forced the hospital into bankruptcy after its insurance refused to pay the penalties after finding a loophole.<ref>[[Walking on a Dream]], x</ref> The doctors learned that Dr. Cahill was planning to clean up the hospital so that it could be sold to a company called Pegasus Horizons. But Richard and Callie conducted additional research of the company and learned that it would be a terrible asset to the hospital.<ref>[[The Face of Change]], x</ref> They brought the survivors together for a secret meeting and discussed purchasing the hospital so they could maintain the hospital in which all the doctors had been trained and which they still loved.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors went to investors looking for a partner to come up with enough money to purchase the hospital. After exhausting all their other investment options, they eventually were given $ million by the Harper Avery Foundation to purchase the hospital. The Harper Avery Foundation, led by [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]], made Jackson Avery their spokesperson on the board,<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref> which upset all the other doctors. They, however, all resolved the conflict when Jackson tried to bring the board together by proposing the hospital be renamed to reflect their beliefs and reasoning behind purchasing the hospital in the first place. This resulted in Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital being renamed to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in , after Lexie Grey and Mark Sloan, the two fatalities of the plane crash.<ref>[[Transplant Wasteland]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite Derek's warnings to slow down, a heavily pregnant Meredith couldn't keep from joining in on a surgery at the beginning of the superstorm. However, Meredith was forced to leave when there was a risk of explosions in the OR. She talked to [[Alex Karev|Alex]] about beating up [[Jason Myers]], only to find out that [[Jo Wilson|Jo]] was the one who had beaten up Jason. She followed Jo into a staircase, where Jo promised she would never let Alex take the fall for what happened to Jason. As Jo left, a construction worker told Meredith that they were done with the grinder in the OR. \"Then why aren't I up there?\" she angrily asked, and as she ran up the stairs, she slipped and rolled down the stairs. She sent Derek a message and got checked out by [[Connie Ryan]], and she promised that everything was fine with the baby. While the surgeons were preparing the hospital and the storm hit Seattle, Meredith's water broke.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was admitted but had to wait for Connie, who was busy with other soon-to-be mothers. Cristina, who found it typical for Meredith to go in labor during a superstorm, stayed by her side while Derek went to look for Connie. He found her, but as she did a check-up on Meredith, she told them that there was face presentation. As she mentioned that a C-section was necessary to deliver the baby safely, the lights went out and the back-up generators failed to engage. Even though they were, at first, hesitant to perform surgery in the dark, they realized there were no other options. The surgery went well, and Derek took his newborn son to the NICU to make sure everything was fine. While closing up, Connie got called away for another mother in need, and she and Meredith trusted Shane to close up. However, Heather and Shane discovered heavy bleeding, and Meredith realized that she had suffered an internal bleed from her fall on the stairs. Before losing consciousness, Meredith instructed Shane, who had found out that her spleen was bleeding, how to stop the bleed. Meanwhile, Heather went to find Dr. Bailey to assist them. Bailey overcame her fear to operate and pulled Meredith through. Meredith was kept in the OR until she was stable and later moved to a room in the maternity ward, where Derek and Zola visited her and their new family member.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a board meeting in her room, the others informed Meredith what had happened during the superstorm. She tried to help out as much as she could, but Derek and the others told her to rest after her major abdominal surgery. While the others left, Cristina stayed behind to chat a little until she got paged. Though it was said at the meeting that the ER had to close, Meredith got confused when she witnessed Stephanie and Jo exchanging supplies to use in the ER. When a stressed Alex entered her room, Meredith managed to calm him down by letting him hold her son. He told her about Richard and Heather, and he gave the baby back to her so she herself could recover her own calm. Meanwhile, Cristina and Bailey started arguing over the course of treatment for Richard, only to find out that Richard had listed Meredith as his medical proxy, which in turn had forced her to choose between Cristina and Bailey's plans. She decided to do so by relying on science and asked to rerun some tests. While waiting for the results, Callie sat down in her room to have a little chat about how she was doing. When Richard's results came back, Meredith decided to side with Bailey and allowed her to operate, which Cristina had advised not to be done. While Bailey operated on Richard, Meredith asked Cristina to admit that the decision was right, and Cristina did.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith later talked with Cristina and Alex about Richard's decision to make her his medical proxy, wondering if she was in his will too. After Richard's surgery, Owen came to Meredith's room to tell her that Bailey had closed Richard back up once [[Catherine Fox|Catherine]] started yelling at them from the gallery. Meredith also consoled a sad Derek, who had lost Heather in surgery. After Meredith ordered Derek to go home with Zola, who had spent enough time in daycare now, Callie and Sofia came in to drop off some things. Callie told them that she had moved out of the apartment and that they would stay at a hotel for a while. Meredith decided to let Callie stay at their house, and she later told Arizona, who had no idea where Callie and Sofia were, that they were at her house. While trying to fall asleep, the interns bothered her to ask for help finding Heather stories to tell Heather's mother, and Meredith told them what she had told George's mother after he died. When the interns left, Jackson came in to tell her that his mother was planning on moving Richard to another hospital. Alex and April came in too to talk about their problems, and as they left one by one, they all refused to bring her a wheelchair. However, she somehow got herself a wheelchair and went to Richard's room in the ICU with Bailey. Bailey still thought that they should open him back up, and Meredith made the call to book an OR for Bailey. Later, back in her room, Cristina and Alex talked with Meredith about medical proxies, and it turned out that Cristina had actually disapproved of Meredith's decision for Richard. After Bailey's surgery, Catherine still wanted to have a second opinion. Meredith told her that Richard chose her to make his decisions, and not Catherine. They started arguing as Richard opened his eyes, and Meredith enthusiastically greeted him.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite his promise to Meredith to take care of the kids so that she could have a year to focus on her work, Derek started to consult on a time-consuming brain mapping project for the White House. The presidential team asked him to become more involved in the project, but he initially refused the offer in an attempt to keep his promise to Meredith. While at April and Matthew's wedding, Derek received a call from the president himself and ended up accepting the offer to put his name on their federal research initiative.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\nThis caused Meredith to become upset with him since she had wanted to continue with her own research work. Derek later learned that the federal team wanted him to run the project's advisory board. While on a trip to Washington, D.C., Derek was offered a full-time job at the National Institutes of Health, and he found a job for Meredith at James Madison Hospital.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Meredith later told Derek that she refused to leave Seattle after Cristina reminded her not to let what Derek wanted eclipse what she needed. Forced to choose between his family and the brain mapping job, Derek decided to stay in Seattle as well and rejected the offer.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, there was excessive tension between Meredith and Derek. Derek was unsatisfied with his job at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, especially because his sister Amelia had taken over as head of the neurosurgery department.\n\nMeredith was upset with Derek for being so attached to the federal initiative position and told him that she never wanted him to give it up for her. [[Deborah Curzon]], a special assistant to the president, came to Seattle in a last attempt to recruit Derek for their team. Derek told her that he was unfortunately unable to accept the offer, but he took her card anyway. Later that day, he got into a fight with Meredith, who told him to take the job in D.C. and leave. Derek called the woman he had spoken to earlier and told her that he did want the job after all.<ref>[[Risk]], x</ref>\n\nHe packed some clothes and went to the airport while Meredith threw away the Post-it note that had signified their marriage. The next day, Meredith and Derek talked on the phone and decided that they can make their relationship work, even if Derek had to take the job with the president. She then took the Post-it note out of the garbage and hung it back up on the wall. After a couple of weeks of Derek in D.C., he came home to Meredith and said that he thought D.C. was everything, but he was wrong. Derek told her that her, Zola and Bailey were everything. Derek told her that he couldn\ut live without her. Meredith replied that she could live without him but that she didn\ut ever want to. The two then hugged and made up. Derek moved back home.\n\nWhen Derek moved back home after being in D.C. the two were lying in bed and Derek told her that she was always the one. He told her that she truly did save him. He also told her that he wanted more with her. Meredith then went to work telling friends that she was happier than ever with her husband and children.\n\nWhen Derek was leaving to hand in his resignation to the White House, he told Meredith to stay and wait for him, just like when he left her at the house of candles so he could break up with Rose. Meredith and Derek kissed and he left. A couple of hours later, Meredith got a call that Derek never showed up for the meeting in Washington D.C.. Meredith soon began to worry about what happened to him. Just as she picked up the phone to call the police, the police came to the house asking if it was the home of Derek Shepherd. She replied yes that\us my husband. Meredith then was told there was an accident.\n\n\n[[File:Meredithsayinggoodbyetoderek.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith says her last goodbye to Derek.]]\nDerek was involved in a car accident with serious injuries. Ultimately, he was declared brain dead, and Meredith had his ventilators turned off. He had been on the way to the airport for a final trip to D.C. where he would wrap up his work and hand in his resignation. After Derek died, Meredith took Zola and Bailey and left Seattle in the middle of the night, much like her mother did with her when she was a child. All Meredith left was a note saying that she and the children were safe. Her friends tried to contact her repeatedly, but she didn't answer. It was later revealed that she moved to San Diego for one year. Finally, Meredith answered on Thanksgiving, telling Alex to stop calling her, that she and the kids were fine.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith put out feelers with a real estate agent to see whether anyone would be interested to buy her house. But she forgot to inform Amelia, which sparked a fight between the two. Amelia was mad at her for not having called her before pulling the plug on Derek, so she couldn't say goodbye. Meredith broke down after the confrontation. She later went to Alex and explained that her house didn't feel like her home without Derek, so she asked if she and the kids could stay with him and Jo for a while. He agreed to that,<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref> but Jo got mad at him for not consulting her first. Meredith felt guilty about forgetting that Amelia was also supposed to be her sister, and gave her her old phone with Derek's last voice mail message. Later that day, she intervened when Catherine and Richard were too angry to get married. Meredith played the dead husband card and got them to the altar after all. That evening, Meredith hosted a party for the newlyweds at her house. At the party, she told Maggie, who was upset about her own parents' divorce, that she could always come to talk to her, about anything. Amelia joined them as Meredith said that a house filled with happy people would be the perfect last memory, as that had been what Derek had wanted. She took Amelia and Maggie's hands and they went inside to dance it out together.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\nAs Jo found a loft for the two of them, Alex moved out of the house and sold it back to Meredith, who moved in with her kids and sisters. The sister started carpooling to work, and Meredith started to teach an intern anatomy class at the hospital. Initially, there were some tensions among Meredith and Amelia, including an argument over whether or not they were going to tear down the wall between the kitchen and the living room, as a drunk Meredith had mused about. Maggie intervened to call a truce. Meredith and Amelia apologized to each other, and Meredith admitted she doesn't know how to talk to Amelia as she's a lot to handle sometimes, and Meredith doesn't totally like her. However, she considered Amelia family, so she didn't have to. She then decided it was okay to tear the wall down.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a busy day where Bailey, the new Chief, dumped all her patients on Meredith, Bailey rewarded Meredith with a promotion to Head of General Surgery.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref> However, Bailey made Meredith an offer with a low salary. After consulting with other department heads, Meredith stood up for herself and asked for the salary she deemed fit. It turned out that Bailey was actually testing her to see if she would stand up for herself and agreed to Meredith's request.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen [[Nathan Riggs]] arrived at the hospital, it did not take long for Meredith to discover the reasons regarding his feud with Owen. Out of loyalty, Meredith asked Owen if they hated Nathan, to which Owen said yes.\n\nThe day Owen sold Derek's trailer, Meredith witnessed Amelia being happy in her new life with Derek's job and a possible engagement to Cristina's former husband. This all resulted in a particularly bad day for Meredith, resulting in her snapping at everyone in the OR, including Nathan. Alex later told her not to crap on everyone's life just because she was choosing to be unhappy and pointed out she had choices. Later that night in the parking lot, Nathan brought up her behavior and that he understood the way she felt about living a life without Derek, comparing it to Megan's disappearance. Things got heated and resulted in her kissing him, which led to them hooking up in her car four times in one night.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Owen and Amelia's wedding, Meredith and Alex talked about possibly having only one true love in your life. At work, Meredith made it clear to Nathan that she didn't want him to get too attached, which he assured her he wasn't.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie confesses her crush on Nathan.]]\nShe then went to the church to get Amelia down the aisle, which included a quick getaway and more debating about having one true love. Meredith concluded it would be better if you believed you can have more than one. This led her to open up to Nathan shortly before the ceremony when they discussed her wedding and his wedding plans with Megan. During the ceremony, Nathan gave Meredith a loving look. However, Maggie misinterpreted his look as being for her, and she confessed to Meredith that she had a crush on Nathan, leaving Meredith in an awkward situation.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nAt the wedding reception, Nathan invited her to dance but she declined. As he was suggesting they get out together, Maggie interrupted and ended up dancing with Nathan. Meredith continued to avoid Nathan after Maggie's confession and told him they had a problem. Before she could elaborate, Jo called her about Alex assaulting Andrew. She went to the hospital to check on Andrew's status and, knowing what really happened, kept Alex updated on Andrew while lying to Maggie about what had happened to Andrew. She and Ben both knew that Alex was the culprit, but she kept protecting Alex to make sure his good side would win. She learned the truth about DeLuca being with Jo through Stephanie and went to tell Alex, who had thought that DeLuca was raping a drunk Jo. She advised Alex to go and tell Bailey what happened, but he went to try and stop Andrew from pressing charges.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Nathan supports Meredith.]]\nNathan found her sitting in a lounge and sat with her at her request as she decided to tell Bailey the truth. She did so, but Alex turned himself in before Bailey could have him arrested. Maggie was upset when she learned that Meredith had lied to her. Meredith said she just did so because they were still figuring things out and promised not to lie to her anymore, like a real sister. However, she immediately broke that promise when she hid the fact that Nathan came to see her that night, asking about the problem she had mentioned as he really felt something between them. She replied someone would get hurt and, since Nathan brushed it off, then lied and said she didn't feel the same way about him.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie later told her about her recurring sexual dreams about Nathan and decided to ask him out like a grown woman ready for her big love. Meredith then accompanied Alex to the courthouse, where he was charged with felony assault in the second degree. This made Alex think of himself as just another piece of trash but Meredith reminded him of his career and remained confident that he wouldn't go to prison. In surgery with Maggie, Owen came in to invite Meredith for a housewarming, and Maggie volunteered to come after finding out Nathan would be there. Meredith later rode an elevator with Andrew and talked about how she was assaulted and forgave the man who did that to her. She added he should be focused on surgery instead of the case, which he interpreted as a threat.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith at the dinner party.]]\nMeredith arrived at the dinner party and she made Owen give Maggie a tour so she could have a private talk with Nathan. She told him Maggie was going to ask him out and she asked Nathan to decline nicely, which Nathan took as a signal that Meredith herself felt something for him, which she denied. At the party, she also asked Jo to talk to Alex even though Jo was more concerned about Andrew. Later at the hospital, Bailey confronted Meredith about her threat to Andrew and warned Meredith not to go down with Alex, but Meredith insisted on standing by him. She and Bailey then had to operate on Alex's patient following a mistake he made, and Meredith invited Andrew to scrub in to clear the air between them. Back at home, Alex told Meredith about Bailey's decision to let him work in the clinic and that he supported that decision because his head wasn't in the game. Meredith then told him about her sleeping with Nathan, just before Maggie came in and told them Nathan turned her down. However, she didn't plan on giving up since he just told her he wasn't dating right now.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey and Catherine brought [[Eliza Minnick]] to be the new Residency Program Director, effectively firing Richard from the job. When Meredith refused to allow Eliza into her OR to observe her teaching technique, Bailey suspended her. Bailey came to her house to get her to come back to her job. She agreed to come back if Richard could return to the Residency Program Director. Bailey declined and Meredith didn't come to work. Richard came over to Meredith's house to get her to come back and said she'd be fine.\n\n\nEventually, Meredith finally agreed to dinner with Nathan, but their plans were postponed when Maggie's mother died and Meredith had to take care of her.<ref>[[Be Still, My Soul]], x</ref> She found herself on an airplane with Nathan, as both were heading to a conference. They ended up hooking up in the airplane bathroom. Both had to tend to patients when the plane hit turbulence. The experience allowed them both to become closer and for Meredith to open up to Nathan about her history. She agreed to stay in a hotel room with Nathan, marking another step in their relationship.<ref>[[In the Air Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs the relationship with Nathan progressed to him sleeping over a lot, Meredith finally found it time for him to meet the kids and invited him to dinner. After doing so, she started to panic a bit, but Amelia pointed out there was nothing or no one standing in her way. However, as she came home after work and told her kids about the upcoming guest, her plans were thwarted when Amelia told her that Megan had been found and was on her way to Seattle. Upon finding out that Nathan didn't know yet, Meredith immediately left to go and tell him. As she arrived at the hospital, she witnessed an explosion from the parking lot.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> Meredith rushed inside and started to help out with evacuating patients due to the spreading fire, all the while looking for Nathan. She also went looking for [[Erin Miller]], a missing girl. While looking for Erin on the OR floor, she found that Nathan had refused to evacuate and was still working on his lobectomy patient. She quickly got gowned and gloved to help him so they'd be out faster. As soon as they could, they left and took the patient to the evac zone outside. He had inhaled some smoke and needed oxygen therapy. Meredith stayed with him and checked his breath sounds. In that quiet moment, she recalled their shared dream of their lost loved one returning to them and finally told him the news about Megan. He broke down and she confronted him, unable to answer his questions about Megan. She could only tell him that Megan would be brought to Madigan Medical Center. He decided to drive up there and could hardly contain his excitement and happiness, something she told him he did not need to apologize for as she understood how he felt. She then told him to get going and watched him drive off.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith talks to Megan before the surgery.]]\nMeredith was at work when Owen and Nathan brought Megan to the hospital. She had a frozen abdomen and Meredith had an idea of how they could reverse her colostomy. While Bailey and Webber advised a conservative approach, but Megan opted for the more radical approach so she could return to her son in Iraq faster. Nathan had doubts about Meredith working on the case given their history, but Meredith assured him she could do it. Megan tried to find out from her who Nathan had been dating, but Meredith didn't answer. [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] also urged her to tell Megan the full story. As she advised Alex to tell Jo that he had found her husband, she realized it was only right Megan also got the full story and went to tell her, only moments before Nathan came in to do so. As she prepped Megan for surgery, she shared that her one great love had died and that she'd do everything to get Megan back to her son, which was Megan's first priority. Meredith nervously scrubbed in for the surgery, which went well right up to the end, when she found out there wasn't enough tissue left to close the wound, angering her.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nShe took her anger out by destroying the attending's lounge and went home, where she was inspired to perform an abdominal wall transplant. She got Teddy on her side and they presented the plan to Megan, who accepted the opportunity to escape her hospital bed and didn't have a problem with Meredith doing the surgery. She had Richard's sub-interns set out to find a donor since UNOS had none available. When she received news they had found one, she went to tell Megan, accidentally interrupting Nathan's proposing to her. Meredith, Teddy, and Jo then performed the surgery without a hitch. Megan recovered well. On her way out, Meredith found Nathan sitting outside on a bench. He told her Megan was still convinced he was in love with Meredith, who was angered and walked off.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\nMeredith did not want to be in another love triangle and believed that Nathan was betraying her by not seizing the miraculous opportunity to be with Megan again. Eventually, with all of Meredith's pushing, Nathan started a new life with Megan in Los Angeles with her son, [[Farouk Shami Hunt|Farouk]].\n\nBecause of her groundbreaking procedure on Megan, Meredith landed the cover of the Journal of Surgical Advancement (JSA) and won a [[Catherine Fox Award]]. She also began a series of ALPPS procedures - a first for any doctor on the West Coast.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref> For Jackson's surgery competition, she submitted a proposal for a mini-liver procedure but was unable to get the patent from her mother's former friend, [[Marie Cerone]], who still held a grudge over her and Ellis' fight. Eventually, Meredith was able to develop the procedure with the help of Jo. She also later broke the hospital's record for the single longest surgery.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith starts treating matchmaker Cece.]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew kissed Meredith while drunk, which he immediately apologized for. While she dismissed at as no big deal, the kiss led to her having sex dreams about the majority of men in her life, such as Andrew, Jackson, and Tom. Soon after, she started treating [[Cece Colvin]], a professional matchmaker, who picked up on Meredith's desire to be kissed, even though Meredith dismissed the observation. She threw her hat in the ring for the recent job opening for interim Chief to have extra work to distract her from her desires. Cece had to be put on dialysis awaiting her kidney transplant. Throughout the set-up, she pointed out that there's no cap on happiness and that love doesn't just come walking through the door. After the surgery, Meredith briefly met [[Atticus Lincoln]] but dismissed him at his attempt to introduce himself. At night in bed, a curious Meredith googled Cece's services but opted against using them.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nWhile the sex dreams continued, Meredith found herself avoiding Cece due to her aggressive matchmaking attempts. Jackson advised her to tell Cece she was married to her work, which she heavily objected to, causing Link to overhear that she wasn't married. In another attempt to find more work, Meredith set out to convince Bailey to allow her to create a surgical innovation fellowship for Jo. Later, she ran into Link and he properly introduced himself. She defended her earlier comment and stated she just meant she had a life outside work. He proposed drinks after work, but she had to assist Maggie in inserting a pacemaker for Cece's heart. During the procedure, Maggie also encouraged her to hire Cece. They later had to inform her that her client, whom she had hit after passing out in her car, had died, Cece opposed being put on the transplant list. Bailey then found Meredith and told her she had stolen Meredith's idea and created the fellowship for Jo under her own leadership. She needed some joy and found that was the way to do it, so she told Meredith to go find joy herself. After finding out she had been passed over as interim Chief, which went to Alex instead, Meredith decided to hire Cece. She admitted to Cece that she was, in fact, married to her work but didn't want to be. Having found a new purpose, Cece accepted her as a client and they started talking.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nAfterward, Meredith got tired of the flood of questions soon and did her best to avoid them. Cece tried to get answers through [[Taryn Helm]], but Meredith only closed herself off even more. She confided in Alex, who told her that after everything she had been through, she had earned the right to close herself off and be selective of whom she wanted to let it. While Meredith found a new way to continue Cece's care, she and Cece agreed to diminish the number of questions and try a new approach as well. She instructed Meredith to go out and buy herself five new outfits and ready herself for something new, which she did.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nCece planned a blind date for Meredith, who briefly came into work beforehand wearing make-up, which was noticed by several men, including Andrew and Link. She met with the guy at a restaurant for lunch having low expectations, but they really hit it off and [[John (Character)|John]] completely understood her dedication to her work. Along the way, they discovered they were actually on the wrong date but decided to keep it going. They left the restaurant and took a stroll. While discussing traveling, John stated that he was happy not having kids that could restrict his travel plans. He even went on to say he hated how desperate single mothers are in the dating scene. Having lost all interest due to his comment, Meredith revealed she had three children of her own and left the date.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andy makes Meredith realize there are positive things to take away from her date.]]\nAt the hospital, she shared her experience with [[Andy Herrera]], who made her see that she now knew there still were great men out there and that she managed to dodge this particular slow-moving bullet because he revealed his opinion on single mothers before the relationship could have dragged on for too long.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nThe blind dates continued. Before a date with [[Daniel (Flowers Grow Out of My Grave)|Daniel]], Meredith was told by Richard that [[Thatcher Grey|her father]] was dying of acute myeloid leukemia. She didn't know what to do about the situation. Link approached her for dinner, but she turned him down as she viewed him as more of an emergency kind of person rather than serious dating potential. In surgery, she and Alex discussed her situation with her father. She opened the door by giving him a piece of her liver, but he never walked through. She wouldn't need to grieve him since he had been a ghost for years. On her date, Meredith rambled on about how it shouldn't be children's job to forgive their parents just because they are their parents. She decided not to reach out since the sole purpose would be making Thatcher feel better, which she didn't think weighed up against the pain it would cause her and her kids. She returned to the hospital, where Link put his number in her phone in case of an emergency. At the same time, Andrew came over to ask Meredith about her date. She said she scared him off. Both Link and Andrew then held the elevator doors for her, causing her to take the stairs. After work, she went to hang at Alex and Jo's with Link, whose hair she cut after he had cut off a piece to comfort a kid facing cancer treatment.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was flown out to Los Angeles with [[Tom Koracick]] by [[Catherine Fox]], who needed their expertise. She revealed she had a spinal tumor. They did extra tests and found it was a grade III chondrosarcoma. Catherine struggled with how to tell Richard. Unbeknownst to her, Meredith received a call from Richard to tell her he had been arrested and was in jail.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Seattle, Meredith bailed out Richard as a windstorm hit Seattle. Back at the hospital, she and Andrew treated a deteriorating Cece, who had discovered Link and suggested him to Meredith. Concerned over Catherine's health, Meredith was dismissive of Maggie's relationship troubles with Jackson. Meredith eventually broke HIPAA and told Maggie about Catherine's cancer. At the same time, Taryn arrived with the news that they had finally found a donor for Cece. Andrew clarified to Cece that there was a very real chance she would not make it off the table alive, but Cece was willing to roll the dice. She did warn Meredith she would come back to haunt her if she didn't do her best to squeeze all possible joy out of her life. This convinced Meredith to say yes to drinks with Link, much to Andrew's dismay. He then sought out Meredith as she was preparing for the transplant and told her that he had fallen in love with her since their kiss and that he wanted her to know that he was an option. While she had some excuses to turn him away, such as her being his attending and his history with Maggie, he thought she felt the attraction between them, too. Overcome by desire, she removed herself from the situation and promised him she'd think about what he had said. Soon after, they got stuck together in an elevator on their way to the OR due to a power outage caused by the storm.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith bond while stuck in an elevator.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith decides not to choose between the two men pursuing her just yet.]]\nWith no cell phone connection, they tried to find a way out to no avail. She asked him to stop looking at her the way he did. He likened their situation to Doctor Who's TARDIS, where the rules don't apply, but she told him the rules still applied. While in there, Andrew confided in her about how his famous surgeon father killed four people while he operated in a manic episode but he got away with it because of his connections. Meredith then decided to try the trap door and he lifted her up but to no avail. As he lowered her down, she dropped into his arms and they almost shared a kiss until the power kicked back in. Finally free, they rushed to the OR. Unfortunately, Cece didn't make it. Meredith closed her up and told her about her interest in both Link and Andrew. Thanks to Cece, she had found happiness again. Afterward, Andrew showed some of his appealing cocky side and asked Meredith out on a date, with Link coming over at the exact moment with the same question. Unable to choose, she decided to go home to her children.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nThe attraction between Meredith and Andrew continued to grow with every surgery did they together. At the same time, she found herself irritated by Link's laid-back attitude. She questioned why Jo ever thought they would be good together and didn't try to hide her disdain from Link. A difference of opinion over a shared patient led to a confrontation in the OR. She wondered why he had kept his reasoning for his non-standard approach from her, to which he replied that convincing her that he belonged here was not a part of his job.\n\nLater, he found out that The Hulk had canceled for [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey's]] superhero birthday party. He offered to help out and they managed to get her house ready in time. He explained he offered to help out because she seemed stressed. He shared he does not believe in letting stress ruin your life after half of his hospital friends died from a cancer he survived and because his parents split up over it. Finally understanding the origins of his laid-back nature, she apologized for the way she behaved. He didn't mind as he liked the chase. The kids then arrived for the party and Link played along with Bailey. They sat down with cake and wine and he complimented her on running a three-kid household all the while winning surgical awards. As she admitted she had grown to like him more over the course of the day, they continued to talk over cake and wine while she ignored Andrew's text asking her to come over to celebrate his first solo surgery.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith reconnects with her dying father.]]\nFollowing Richard's urging, Meredith decided she did want to say goodbye to her father before it was too late. She went to visit him and discovered he had moved to Zimbabwe after Lexie's death. The realization he had yet again left her behind hurt her deeply, but he revealed he had actually come back for Derek's funeral. However, he saw how lost she was and decided not to bother her any further one of the most difficult days of her life. Conversation then came easier and Meredith told him about Maggie and her children and comforted him until he died with her by his side.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Jo and Alex invited Meredith for their classy NYE party. Andrew came over to ask Meredith out for drinks. She declined as she had to go put her kids to bed, but she did invite him to come to the party with her. Link, dressed as Santa, came over to give Meredith cookies from his bag while on his way to the peds ward. Jo mocked Meredith's love triangle, but Meredith stated there was no love and thus no triangle. Afterward, Andrew asked Meredith when she was going to stop stringing Link along as he was growing tired of wasting time not being with her. She assured him NYE was an actual date between them. However, she stayed at the hospital, thus standing up both Link and Andrew at the party.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew confronts Meredith about her behavior.]]\nLater at work, Andrew confronted Meredith over her standing him up and stated it was just rude of her. As time went on, he witnessed her convincing her patient's husband not to give up, he wondered how she could tell the man that if she herself kept running away from love. He thought she was so beyond him, but it turns out she was just a kid hiding behind excuses. To spite him, Meredith turned around and asked Link out to dinner. He was surprised since it was Valentine's Day but gladly accepted. Later that day, Meredith officiated a wedding between her patient and her fianc\ue shortly before the former's death. Afterward, Andrew took Meredith to the hospital roof for a spontaneous date with champagne. She stayed with him and they ended up sharing their first kiss while Link waited for her at the restaurant.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith apologized to Link for standing him up. She also held off on going on a real date with Andrew because she wanted to make sure Maggie was okay with it. While awaiting the date, Andrew kept staring at her longingly so Meredith set a rule that he could not do that at work so at to not be distracted from her work. After successfully operating on [[Kimberly Thompson|a woman from Maggie's past]] together, Maggie was finally ready to hear her out. While surprised, she was fine with it, so Meredith then went to find Andrew and took him out on a date to a restaurant. He agreed but insisted it'd be his treat.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew lets Meredith sleep.]]\nFollowing their date, Andrew assisted her as she broke the hospital's longest surgery record with a  hour and -minute surgery. Afterward, an exhausted Meredith fell asleep on a gurney in a hallway, so Andrew moved her to a bed in an empty room and covered her with a blanket.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith plan to leave soon for a night to themselves.]]\nOn the day of Jackson's party to celebrate Catherine surviving her surgery, Meredith told Chief Karev about her relationship with Andrew. He mocked her and also told her to report it to HR. She took Andrew to the party with her as her plus one, though they did not plan on staying long as Meredith had the house to herself. However, their plans were disrupted when Amelia had a fight with Owen and planned on sleeping at the house. Andrew then took Meredith into a guest room at Jackson's and they started making out there, only to be caught by Richard. To calm herself and \"act normal\", Meredith took Andrew into the kitchen and took over preparing egg rolls from the catering staff, inadvertently putting a plastic tray in the oven, which led to the penthouse being evacuated right before the big celebratory speech. Andrew and Meredith then decided to go to his place, but their plans were once again disrupted, this time by the return of [[Carina DeLuca]] with [[Vincenzo DeLuca]], Andrew's father.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew asks Meredith to trust his judgment on his father.]]\nVincenzo came to Seattle to pitch research on gestational sacks, while Meredith had a dream about her mother that steered her towards finding a specific new research project, though she had yet to figure out what exactly it was. While she spent the day in a lab trying to find an answer, Andrew visited and told her that his father seemed stable despite Carina's claims that he was bipolar. At the same time, Maggie publicly revealed her biological parentage to the medical community, which Meredith was fine with. Meredith talked about Vincenzo with Alex and advised him to dig deeper before agreeing to fund the research, but hid her knowledge about his mental illness so as to not break Andrew's trust. She later came across the arguing DeLuca siblings in a hallway. Carina wanted to shut the research down, but Andrew had signed on, insisting their father was stable. While Meredith herself remained on the fence, Andrew asked her to trust his judgment on this. At the end of the day, Meredith concluded her research had to be about non-invasive diagnostic tools.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew spent all his time on his father's research while Meredith gave him the space to do so. While her bad feeling about the project persisted, she decided to just be supportive of Andrew. In the end, Vincenzo's display of reckless behavior led to Alex shutting the research down. Meredith found Andrew clearing out the lab and he requested some time alone, so she told him to let her know if he needed anything and left him be.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith works on her research while Andrew ignores her.]]\nAndrew continued to shut Meredith out, so she focused her time and energy on her ingestible diagnostic device research. He later sent her a text to come over, which she did. She told him she was past the point in her life where she would sit around at work wondering if her boyfriend was ignoring her. He knew that, but he just needed some time to be hurt over his father and he did not want to drag her down with him. To make up for his behavior, he made her an apology dinner.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith assisted Jackson, Catherine, Owen, and [[Megan Hunt]] on a complex surgery involving an abdominal wall transplant and a penis and scrotum transplant, Richard gave Andrew a solo lap appy under his supervision. Meredith spent the day worrying about Andrew, but he passed Richard's test with flying colors despite the surgery turning into a complicated procedure. Richard told her that Andrew was a good man and Andrew later talked her through his day over dinner at his place.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nThe relationship continued to evolve but Meredith never let him sleep over since she didn't want her kids to meet him before she had told them about him. However, one night, Andrew ran into Zola while sneaking out, thus disrupting Meredith's plan on how to tell her kids. At work, Meredith and Andrew's patient turned out to be in labor instead of having an obstruction. Meredith asked Bailey for advice on how to tell her kids. After watching Andrew take care of the newborn baby, Meredith decided to gather her kids that night. Over ice cream, she told them that Andrew was her boyfriend and that he would be visiting more, but that she was not going anywhere, following Bailey's advice.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith's happy life continued for a short while until she joined Alex and Andrew on [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabriella Rivera's]] case. Gabby and her mother had been detained at the Mexican border. Gabby was reunited with her father after three months while her mother was still in the detention center. Since she was given little to no medical care, Luis had no clue what was going on with her. A scan revealed an obstruction that eventually led to her needing surgery. Unable to pay for it, Luis applied for state coverage but he earned too much cleaning office buildings to qualify. With Gabby's condition worsening, Meredith promised she had a plan. She secretly put her daughter Ellis's name on the paperwork, which alarmed Richard. He yelled at her for what she did, but she insisted that the system was broken and that they could debate her actions later. She then headed into surgery. Pathology revealed that the obstruction was caused by lymphoma, meaning they were looking at years of treatment and follow-up.\n\nAfter the surgery, Richard pointed out that Meredith was risking losing her license and a prison sentence for committing a felony and that implicating Luis in insurance fraud wouldn't help his asylum. He then suggested that they make Gabby sicker on paper so they could keep her in the hospital for  days, after which a new state policy would automatically kick in regardless of Luis' income. They rolled with it and assured Luis he could sleep in Gabby's room every night so they would not have to be separated again. Meredith assumed that Andrew was judging her for her actions, but he revealed he was actually in awe of her and hadn't spoken out because he was afraid he would tell her that he loved her. Taken by surprise, Meredith barely responded to his confession and left.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nUpon finding out that Jo still hadn't spoken to Alex after her return from Pittsburgh, Meredith went to stay with Jo while Alex took her place in her household. Jo shut her out and said Meredith was only there to hide from her own life. Meredith admitted that Andrew's \"I love you\" terrified her because it reminded her of Derek and all the pain she had been through. She then said she understood pain from deep experience and that her parents had messed with her head, like Alex's had, so they would both understand whatever had happened in Pittsburgh. Jo then revealed that her mother was raped by her father and that she looked like him. Jo then opened up about how all the terrible things in her life were just her birthright, but Meredith quipped with good things that Jo had been a part of. To get through to her, Meredith talked about how she stopped fighting when she was about to drown and asked if Jo wanted to stop fighting, too, or if she just needed a few more days under her covers. Jo replied the latter, after which Meredith insisted they go talk to Alex and Bailey to get her a proper leave of absence so she could get the help she needed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Trapped, Meredith fails to stop Andrew from taking the fall for her.]]\nWhile Jo waited to talk to Bailey, she asked Meredith to go and tell Alex. Meredith joined him in the hyperbaric chamber with [[Gus Carter]], while unbeknownst to her, her insurance fraud had come to light and Andrew was being questioned by Bailey, Catherine, and representatives from the insurance company. Soon after, Andrew came by with Catherine to say goodbye; he claimed that he had committed the fraud and apologized to her. Meredith wanted to stop him from taking the fall, but she couldn't stop him from taking the fall and turning himself in as she could not leave the chamber.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nUnwilling to explain the whole situation to the technicians through the phone to stop Andrew, Meredith had no choice but to focus on Gus and Alex. She told him about Jo's depression and what had caused it. After finding out about what Andrew did, Richard dropped by. Meredith asked him to set the record straight as Andrew's career would not survive this. He pointed out her children wouldn't recover if she were locked up, but she planned on hiring a great lawyer and plead her case, confident that her track record and the fact that it was her first offense would help her win. As Gus coded, the decompression process was started. She and Alex pulled Gus through and she rushed off.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith informs Bailey and Catherine on what she did.]]\nShe went to set the record straight with Bailey and Catherine. Alex and Richard came to her defense, but Bailey fired all three of them. Having made her mind up, Meredith went home to tell her kids that she would have to leave for a while to go take care of something. She then went to visit Andrew in jail and told him he needed to let her clean up her own messes and develop some self-preservation skills. She stood by her decision. She told him she loved him and left to set the record straight.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nShe immediately went to her attorney. Much to her surprise, she was told that she could go home. The lawyer would schedule a hearing, where she suspected Meredith would be ordered to a few hours of community service in a clinic if she was repentant. Additionally, she deemed it highly unlikely that the medical board would pursue action her license. A week later, the hearing took place and Meredith explained to the judge that Gabriela's cancer meant too many procedures and money to pay for herself or cover it pro bono. She stated the system should have supported the Riveras and that it was broken. She honestly said she only regretted her decisions to the extent she could knowing that they led to Gabriela doing well now. The judge got angry and the lawyer blurted out her three kids as a reason to keep her out of jail. She was then ordered to community service but picking up trash on the streets instead of at a clinic.\n\nWhile picking up trash, she started to give out medical advice when other people in her group found out she was a doctor. After a few weeks, Suzie Wilson, Zola's classroom mom, passed by and recognized her. Thinking she was volunteering, Suzie said she finally understood why Meredith never volunteered at school. Meredith explained working mothers don't have time for that, after which her supervisor shouted at her, revealing that she was actually there per court order. Suzie spread the word at school, which was overheard by Zola, who come home to ask her how to spell criminal. While enjoying some ice cream with Andrew, Meredith told him she was happy both she and the kids were healthy and that she actually found some sense of accomplishment in picking up trash. She then received a letter from the medical board to inform her they were, in fact, pursuing action against her license.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShe started disguising herself better to avoid getting recognized again. One morning, she found out her hearing about her license was scheduled three months later. Taking advantage of still having her license, she continued to give out medical advice to people on her crew, referring them to Pac-North for further care. She also had Levi bring her supplies from Grey Sloan, which she thought of as hers since she still owned the hospital. Her supervisor [[Robin (Season )|Robin]] started to object to her street clinic since it was keeping people from doing their work but Meredith brought up she had noticed a nodule in Robin's neck that warranted a closer look. Robin had seen her primary care physician about it, who referred her to an ENT, but her appointment was still months away. After convincing her that detecting possible cancer was more important than staying at work for two more hours, Meredith took her to the Grey Sloan parking lot for an ultrasound. Given the features shown on there, she convinced Jackson to take the time to perform a biopsy, which revealed papillary thyroid cancer, which could be treated. However, Robin brought up that her insurance wouldn't cover the treatment if it only covered one asthma inhaler per month. Jackson said they would look into options for her, which Robin said would boil down to bankruptcy or death. Meredith was then discovered in the hospital by Bailey but she stated she was just visiting a friend. That night at home, Meredith shared that continuously seeing people being let down by the medical system had made her decide to write about what she was seeing despite her lawyer advising her to lay low.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nShe got in touch with a website that would publish her story and shared some titles she had thought of with Andrew, all of them insulting to the medical system. She didn't care about her standing with the medical community since they were in a fight already anyway. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Meredith's patient [[Shirley Gregory]] was refusing to let Jo operate on her despite her being a student of Meredith's. Jo then had Bailey agree to have Meredith supervise the procedure remotely through video chat, which convinced Shirley to consent. Meredith used Robin owing her to follow the entire procedure through but Bailey hung up on her as soon as the procedure was over, leaving Meredith to go take care of a beehive in a discarded toilet. Link and Amelia came over to hang out with her and Andrew at the house. Amelia shared she was pregnant. Meredith congratulated her, excited about becoming an aunt.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWithout her knowledge, the website combined all her suggested topics into one article entitled \"Hospital Hell at Grey Sloan Memorial: Fired Surgeon Speaks Out.\" Including sharp comments about insurance companies, Big Pharma, and institutionalized discrimination, the article started trending online. She realized the article would terrify people and keep patients away from Grey Sloan. She also figured Bailey would hate her even more, which Andrew confirmed as soon as he got to work. Meredith attempted to set the record straight with the website but they refused to delete the article or even change the headline because of the popularity it had gained. Meredith quickly finished her assigned zone at community service and asked her [[Supervisor Lisa|supervisor]] to be allowed to leave to take care of an emergency. Her supervisor told her that she would inform the judge of all her extracurriculars if she left before putting in the required hours. After Meredith learned even Cristina had learned about the article, she promised Lisa she would make up the hours and begged her not to call the judge, after which she took off. At the hospital, after Jo confirmed that Bailey was furious at her, Meredith went to see her and told her that she had nothing to do with the article as all the things she had written herself were not directed at the hospital. She offered to write a retraction but Bailey said they never get read. Meredith stressed she loved the hospital and how sorry she was but Bailey said the damage had been done and asked her to leave.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith defends her choices to Andrew.]]\nOn her way out, she ran into Andrew and told him what had gone down and that she had gotten a summons to go back to court because she had walked out on community service. Andrew hated that she made a choice that could land her in jail and added to the possibility of her losing her license. He wished she would have done the community service and come back to work to change the system from within, but she said nothing she had written was untrue and that she wasn't going to sit on her mountain of privilege leaving others to fight for themselves in the broken system that was hurting and killing them. She added that if he really expected her to sit back and nothing, he didn't know her at all, and walked away from him.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nHer skipping out on community service gave her nightmares. On the day of her court hearing, she woke up to Zola telling her she wasn't feeling well. When Zola vomited during breakfast, a worried Meredith took her to the hospital and asked Tom for a head CT given Zola's history of spina bifida. While waiting for the CT, her lawyer reminded her she needed to be in court but the scans revealed Zola's shunt needed to be revised. Andrew tried to convince her to go to court while he'd look out for Zola but Meredith made it clear there was no way she would leave her daughter. Tom made Meredith wait in the waiting area so she made Taryn promise to text her updates. Andrew offered to sit with her but she didn't like him offering to skip a surgery to be her human tissue. Maggie and Amelia came to sit with her and Meredith vented her frustration about Andrew, who just didn't get her because he wasn't a parent himself. She said Andrew was sexy and fun but she wasn't sure if he was more than that or if she even wanted him to be. She then asked Maggie and Amelia to talk about their lives to distract her. Meredith grew increasingly worried despite Taryn's reassuring texts. As she was about to head to the OR, Zola's surgical team came by to tell everything had gone fine. Meredith ordered Andrew to stay by Zola's side in post-op. Later that night, Meredith headed out to get Zola some Jello. She ran into Andrew, who had anticipated the request and had found her a cup. Her lawyer then appeared and Meredith explained why she hadn't shown up for the hearing. Nancy told her she squeezed a drop of humanity out of the judge, which meant she'd have to make up the lost hours in jail.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith went to jail. On Halloween, she woke up with her roommate [[Paula (Season )|Paula]] hovering over her face because Meredith had been snoring. Since she was supposed to be let out that day and was eager to spend the holiday with her kids, Meredith watched the clock closely. When the time came, she addressed a guard, who told her that, as per usual, a crucial document for her release hadn't arrived one time but that it would show up soon. Meredith tried to bribe the guard by offering medical advice to any sick family members but it didn't work. Paula then learned she was a doctor and wondered what she did to end up in jail. Meredith told her about her crime, which was still threatening her medical license. Paula wasn't impressed with her small problems and told her how she had landed there. She was still waiting for her hearing but couldn't post bail so she was stuck in jail until the hearing, which would most likely be another month. Meanwhile, her kids were placed in the foster system. Meredith helped her out with a puzzle and commented that she was strong for not letting herself go crazy with worry over her kids. The guard came to let Meredith out and they wished each other good luck. The officer told Meredith to keep fighting the good fight without landing herself in jail. Meredith then asked the man for a favor. She went home and greeted her kids. She told her sisters she had come to realize she had a lot to work with even if she were to lose her license. She then called her lawyer and made arrangements to pay Paula's bail so she could be reunited with her kids.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nHaving made up for the hours, Meredith went back to doing community service. She ran into Amelia on her way out one day and advised her to tell Owen about the pregnancy. Meredith was working near Pac-North and decided to have coffee with Alex during her break. While in line at the coffee cart, she ran into Amelia and Maggie who told her about their problems.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of her hearing, Meredith drove to the hotel with her sisters, Alex, and Andrew. While waiting to enter the room of the hearing, Meredith waited with most of Grey Sloan's attendings, including Bailey. Upon entering the room, Nancy asked Meredith to keep quiet for once given the vicious prosecutor and let her do her job. Meredith promised she would.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith learns Paul Castello is on the panel.]]\nThe hearing began and the judge introduced the doctors on the panel. [[Paul Castello]] came in late and Meredith immediately recognized him as the doctor who had killed Derek, while he didn't seem to remember her at all. Meredith quietly explained the situation to Nancy but upon learning that the hearing would have to be rescheduled, which could take six months, Meredith decided to power through with Paul on the panel. Bailey took the stand first and denied Nancy's suggestions of her and Meredith being close. She stated Meredith no longer held the qualities that had prompted Bailey to appoint her Head of General Surgery. Afterward, the prosecutor presented her with a list of questionable events Meredith had been involved in, all of which Bailey confirmed to be true. Afterward, Luis Rivera testified that Meredith had saved his daughter and that there should be more doctors like her. Andrew was mostly questioned about their relationship, which he assured them was completely consensual and that Meredith had not pressured him to keep the fraud quiet when he discovered it. He was also confronted with his request for a transfer, which detailed Meredith's and other attendings' abuse of him after he pressed charges against Alex for assaulting him. Andrew assured the panel that that had been cleared up and left in the past. He apologized to Meredith, who said it was okay. Levi began testifying about Meredith being an amazing teacher but he was soon forced to confess that he had been the one who had reported the fraud to Bailey. He broke down and ran out after his testimony. During the recess that followed, Meredith told Andrew that their relationship wouldn't survive if her license were taken away.\n\nAfter the recess, Owen testified to her surgical skills, specifically on Megan's case, but the prosecutor had dug up Bailey's post-op notes, which mentioned Owen voicing serious doubts about Meredith's approach at the time. Richard was questioned about the Alzheimer trial but he maintained that he was the only one who had played a role in that. The prosecutor commented on the pattern of his bending the rules for Meredith and called [[Patricia Murphy]] to the stand. She shared that Meredith hadn't been matched to Seattle Grace at first until Richard reached out to the NRMP to make a personal recommendation, which landed Meredith her spot. Meredith was shocked upon hearing this. Alex testified about Meredith making him a better person and surgeon. He was asked about the delay in Zola's adoption. He kept her kidnapping of Zola quiet and said delays happen all the time. The prosecutor suspected it had something to do with Meredith's being fired. Alex hesitated to answer. Paul then began pressing him to answer, asking if Meredith's insubordinate behavior had almost cost her her daughter. Meredith shot up and told him that he had no right to talk about her daughter as he had been the one to kill her father as he neglected to do even basic burr holes, let alone a head CT. Meredith yelled that he didn't deserve to judge her or anyone for that matter, after which he had a sudden seizure. She was among the doctors who rushed to his aid. She briefed the paramedics when they arrived and stressed that they should get him a head CT. \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Gabby is among the patients who showed up to show their support for Meredith.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey re-hires Meredith to work at Grey Sloan.]]\nAfter another recess, the judge announced that the hearing would be postponed given the situation. Alex, however, objected and let in a large group of people, all of whom had been treated by Meredith. [[Ray Ford]], [[Shirley Gregory]], [[Robin (Season )|Robin]], and [[Katie Bryce]] all testified that Meredith had saved their lives. Alex then read a letter from Cristina, which stated that taking Meredith's license meant signing death certificates of countless future patients and that Meredith was an unstoppable light in a broken system. Alex wanted to proceed with letters from Callie, Arizona, April, and even Addison, but the judge had heard enough. He asked to clear the room but Bailey had something more to say. She stated Meredith had in fact broken the law to save a life, so she deserved to pick up trash, but she did not deserve to have her license taken over it. Bailey stated Meredith was too good of a surgeon for that and that everything she had survived made her better instead of cold or hard. Everyone then had to clear the room. Meredith waited outside until Nancy came to deliver the news that the majority of the panel had voted to drop the entire thing, meaning she got to keep her license. Meredith briefly hugged Andrew and was then flooded with hugs from her other friends. As they all left the hotel, Bailey told Meredith she could return to work at Grey Sloan. Meredith accepted the offer and hugged her.\n\nAt home, she ran into Jackson as Maggie was throwing him out. Shortly after, Andrew arrived. He wanted to talk. She apologized for what she had said about their relationship. He knew she had meant it. He pointed out everything he had done for her with the whole insurance fraud situation, which he said was what you do for your partner. However, he had come to realize that unlike him, she did not truly see him as her partner. While she was talking about Derek in that hearing, he realized that she didn't respect him like she did Derek. Meredith told him she respected him, too, but he insisted some part of her was wondering if he would ever be her equal. He told her to take some time to think about her future and if she wanted him to be a part of that.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn her first day back, Meredith snuck into work to do two lap appies before breakfast to ease back in. Cristina also had sent her a package to congratulate her but it was nowhere to be found. The resident presented her with a welcome back cake. Andrew didn't know she was coming back. She said she had wanted to tell him but he was too busy dumping her. He said he hadn't dumped her but it was all the same to her. While rounding on [[Jamie Caldwell]], [[Cormac Hayes|Dr. Cormac Hayes]] abruptly interrupted and introduced himself as the new head of peds. He sidelined Meredith and had Andrew present the case again. Scans revealed a mass. Cormac suspected a tumor but Meredith suggested it may be leftover gallstones from the gallbladder removal she had performed a few years back. She didn't want to worry Jamie and her mother about cancer until a biopsy had confirmed it. Cormac went behind her back and told them anyway. Meredith stepped in and assured them nothing was certain yet. During surgery, the biopsy results came in, revealing the mass was not malignant. She went to take it out. Cormac objected but Meredith shut him down by saying he was a guest in her house. It turned out Meredith had been right with her guess.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith learns that Cristina sent her Cormac as a present.]]\nIn post-op, Jamie didn't care about the successful surgery as her crush still hadn't texted her back. Cormac stepped in and said that raising boys himself had taught him that boys are just terrified of talking to girls, so it didn't mean that he wasn't interested in her at all. While leaving work, Meredith ended up on an elevator with Cormac and asked him if it was his thing to scare people at first and then bask in the relief with them later. He told her he just preferred to give people all the information and let them figure out what to do with it, a courtesy that his wife's doctors hadn't shown him before she did. He told her they would have to learn how to live together in her house. As he stepped off, Cristina finally informed Meredith her package wasn't a thing but a person: Cormac, whom she had nicknamed McWidow. Meredith then stared after him, not noticing Andrew who had been planning to set the record straight.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith went to complain about Cormac to Alex and Jo, only to find that Alex was in Iowa and that Jo had brought home a baby from her Safe Haven volunteer work. Link pointed out Jo had kidnapped a baby but Meredith understood why she had taken the baby for the night. They barely had time to catch up before the three of them were paged to the hospital for multiple traumas after a car crashed into Joe's bar. Meredith called in Owen and Richard to help out. After checking that Andrew was okay, Meredith began treating [[Taryn Helm]]. While she implanted an IVC filter, an inebriated Taryn confessed that she was in love with Meredith. Meredith didn't really react to save her from further embarrassment. She wanted to return to the ER with Levi, who collapses. Meredith did a full workup and diagnosed cardiomyopathy. She paged Teddy, who did an angio while Meredith sat by his head. Meredith assured Levi that she had forgiven him for reporting the insurance fraud. Afterward, Meredith briefly talked with Cormac. Jo saw them and commented she could see something between them. Richard then asked her to come. He told her Bailey had had a miscarriage and needed some comforting. They got a box of doughnuts and sat down with her in her office so she wouldn't feel lonely.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith texted Cristina to get more info on Cormac but Cristina stayed mum. Cormac came into the lounge to get coffee and after he was gone, Amelia commented on his being hot. Meredith then went to find Andrew and told him that she didn't like his telling her to take time to think. He told her about his patient who was inexplicably having fevers three days after a routine appendectomy. Meredith said she'd think on it but advised him to also tell Bailey. Before leaving, she told him she was missing him. He reminded her that he hadn't dumped her so she didn't have to miss him. En route to the ER, Meredith asked Cormac about Cristina, though he didn't realize whom she was talking about. While waiting on the scans of their shared patients, he asked her not to hold their first meeting against him as it was around the time he had lost his wife two years earlier. She understood and assured him it would get better over time, though not all the way better. They disagreed over approaches and had to convert to his when hers failed. He didn't hold it against her as he had had the same disagreement with Cristina once, though he was on Meredith's side back then. He then realized Meredith had brought up Cristina earlier but she made an excuse and left without divulging any further information about their connection. She went to Andrew, who still hadn't figured out what was wrong with his patient, and asked him to talk her through the entire case.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThat led them to reconcile to some degree. They spent the night together. In the morning, he received word that his patient [[Suzanne Britland]] was being moved to the CCU. While getting dressed, he said they should talk about their relationship soon and revealed he had lured diagnostician [[Lauren Riley]] from UCSF to the hospital using Meredith's name before rushing out. At work, Meredith encountered Cormac as he was giving his boys a tour of the hospital. She ran into Amelia, who had seen Andrew leave the house and wondered if they were back together. Meredith said it was just sex at this point. Later, Lauren approached her, and Meredith wrongly addressed her as the consult from UCLA, making Lauren realize that Andrew had lied. On her way to consult on Levi's patient, she ran into Cormac, whose boys had ditched him in an attempt to make them late for the parent-teacher conferences. He was in awe of her staying sane while combining her job and raising her three kids, though she admitted to dropping some balls here and there. Meredith had to tell Levi's patient that her cancer had metastasized beyond the point of treatment. She came to see how Levi set up a dance floor in the cafeteria for the patient and her husband, which made her reflect on how she used to be the kind of person who did romantic things like that. Now, she broke up with Andrew after her trial and just woke up happy to get to practice medicine the next day without giving the break-up much thought. Bailey told her that it was part of growing up. Jackson then came in to inform them that Richard was refusing to work at Grey Sloan on Catherine's terms. The three of them threatened to quit if Tom didn't rehire Richard and Owen on their terms. Tom complied.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and Carina share their concerns over Andrew's mental health.]]\nMeredith started to put together a pro bono surgery day. As she was recruiting Cormac to operate, Andrew interrupted the conversation to inquire about a past patient of hers who had developed a post-op rash similar to Suzanne's, whom they had taken off all her meds so more indicative symptoms could manifest. Meredith talked him through the case and noticed that he was speaking fast and apparently had not slept for days. She confronted Lauren's about her treating Andrew like a machine but Lauren pointed out she was counting on it, with Suzanne's life hanging in the balance. Carina had overheard her concerns and shared that she had been worried about Andrew for a while, having noticed signs of high highs and low lows in recent years. Meredith was on the fence if his dedication was mania or healthy obsession but Carina pointed out she wouldn't ask that question about a resident she didn't love. Meredith then took her concerns to Bailey, who put Meredith on Suzanne's case to approve every step.\n\nOut of nowhere, as Meredith was checking on Suzanne, Andrew and Lauren rushed in with the diagnosis of Still's disease and Andrew injected her with high-dose steroids without any explanation. Meredith pointed out he could have taken a minute to explain his actions before administrating steroids, which could kill her if they were wrong about the diagnosis. Fortunately, they were right and Suzanne quickly recovered. Meredith sought out Andrew to inform him about her status but he lashed out. She said that move could have ended his career had it gone wrong and she pointed out he was not in the right state of mind to make life-and-death decisions. He blamed her for being a hypocrite. Cormac tried to intervene but Meredith had it covered. Andrew went on praising himself for saving Suzanne's life against all odds, which led Meredith to point out he was sounding like his father. She suggested he get some sleep, but he said he didn't need any of this nor her. He told her they were done and left. Cormac suggested the write him up but Meredith declined. She sat down to text Alex, who started typing up a reply but stopped, which worried her.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAlex continued to dodge her even though she knew he was not in Iowa. As a blizzard hit Seattle and blocked off all roads, Cormac was unable to get a donor liver from Seattle Pres to Grey Sloan. Andrew overheard and offered to go get it himself, being used to the cold due to growing up in Wisconsin. Meredith tried to talk him out of it but he brushed off her concerns and took off. While he was off, Meredith and Cormac worked to stabilize the girl, who developed a hemorrhage. As they waited, she told him about how she got fired and he talked about him and Cristina treating a kid with a similar condition in Switzerland, bringing up a story Cristina had told him about Alex saving a kid with that condition as well. He said Cristina talked about Alex a lot but Meredith was surprised to hear she had never mentioned her to Cormac.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith gets to know Cormac as they wait for the liver.]]\nAn hour after they got word Andrew had left Seattle Pres with the liver, Meredith got anxious. Cormac told her about moving to Switzerland after his wife's death, which she likened to her fleeing to San Diego. They talked about lives without their spouses and agreed the firsts without them are especially tough. Andrew then came in with the liver and frostbitten fingers, as he had forgotten to wear gloves. Meredith and Cormac saved the girl. She went to inform Andrew, whose fingers had been treated by Jackson. Together with Carina, she again voiced her concerns over his mental state but he ordered her to leave the room. She and Cormac left the hospital to go spoil their kids. He asked her who Andrew was to her. She replied he was a first, the first man she told \"I love you\" to after Derek. He told her it was nice to meet someone widowed young like him. She agreed. As she walked off, Cormac told her Cristina mentioned her \"twisted sister\" a lot, whom he now suspected was Meredith. She just shrugged and walked off.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOn her day off, she received a letter from Alex. He wrote that he had left Seattle, admitting he had chosen the easy way out as he didn't want her to give him crap for his decision to set him straight. He revealed he was with Izzie and explained that he reached out to get a letter of support for Meredith's trial, which finally gave him a good excuse to reach out to her. He wrote that during his call with Izzie, he heard children in the background, and Izzie told him they were his. She had used the frozen embryos, which he had given her permission to do way back when. He had secretly taken off to meet his twins right after the trial. He went on to describe his kids and his life with Izzie and said he needed to be a father to his kids, which Meredith had taught him how to be through being a mother to her kids. He wrote that he'd miss the hell out of her but assured her that she was perfectly capable of being her own person with him and Cristina gone. He also asked her not to show up to his house to talk him into returning to Seattle because, for the first time in his life, he felt that he was exactly where he needed to be. He concluded by saying she was always welcome to visit once she had accepted his decision so that his kids could meet their Auntie Mer, adding that he hoped she wouldn't hate him too much. Meredith was emotional but decided to respect his wish. Later, she explained to Zola that Uncle Alex had left.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Amelia inquired about Alex's departure but Meredith said she didn't want to talk about it. She and Levi treated Noelle, a woman who had had an accident working jobs through an app that she needed to make ends meet. The patient revealed she had been rationing her insulin. At that moment, Meredith was paged by Tom and found that he had cleared an entire floor for [[Griffin Ford]], a VIP billionaire patient, which explained the problem with admissions that Noelle had had. Tom had her examine Griffin, who came to the hospital looking for a medical reason as to why he had made a grave error that had caused a rocket to explode above Seattle. She reluctantly did the exam but took off as soon as Noelle's CT results got back, leaving Griffin in Jackson's care. Noelle coded and went into DIC. They were unable to save her. She ran into Tom, who asked her what she would do with Griffin's money. She had a whole list ready on how to improve the world. He then asked her how she decided which rules to break. She told him she just followed her gut to make the world better. At the end of the day, Meredith reflected on the inequity she had witnessed and told Bailey she missed Alex to cheer her up. She finally told someone she wasn't sure she could do this on her own. Bailey recognized the feeling, being the last one standing from her residency class, and then told Meredith that Richard was stepping down from surgery.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith meets her pro bono patients.]]\nOn her pro bono surgery day, she had  surgeries to divide among four surgeons, all before Tom would shut down the project at  PM. She tried to recruit Richard but he still refused to operate. Patients and their family members grew upset as Meredith had to solve multiple issues, like Andrew going behind her back and messing up her OR schedule to get a patient into an OR and away from her supposed aunt as he suspected the patient was a human trafficking victim. She ended up asking Tom for more time. He complied and spontaneously agreed to pay for the overtime, explaining that Griffin Ford paid them a lot of money. She pieced together that Tom had made a fake diagnosis to fit Griffin's agenda in exchange for a large amount of money, which Tom was planning on using to fix the world like she had advised him too. Suddenly, a code violet was called and she found Andrew making a scene in the OR waiting room, where he tried to keep his patient's aunt away from her niece. As he was yelling accusations, Meredith and other attendings formed a human circle around him, indicating he was the dangerous person rather than the aunt and convinced him to go to Bailey's office.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith convinces Andrew not to quit.]]\nShe later found out he had quit as he felt people were obstructing him in accomplishing the impossible and changing lives. She told him she loved him and begged him not to quit and instead take the suspension Bailey had proposed so that he wouldn't ruin his career. He agreed to that only if Meredith called the national trafficking hotline, which she agreed to. Later, Amelia came to ask for a spot for her veteran patient and when Meredith agreed, an uproar ensued among the other scheduled patients, who feared they'd be sent home without their promised surgery. Meredith then decided that everyone would get their surgery and that the hospital would host a monthly pro bono surgery day from here on out, for which she credited their generous donor. They managed to perform all the surgeries. Bailey later informed her that the aunt and her niece had disappeared, making them fear that Andrew had been right. Cormac complimented her on her work today but she was too concerned about the human trafficking situation to accept the praise. He then said he could finally see the twisted-ness Cristina had been talking about.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was supposed to accompany Richard to Los Angeles for his speech on his PathPen at the Surgical Innovation Conference but she had to stay home as her sitter got the flu. Zola set up a live feed for them to watch his talk, which went disastrously as he dismissed his Pen and started rambling nonsense about having found a cure for cancer. A worried Meredith watched in horror as Maggie and Cormac dragged Richard off the stage and called for an ambulance.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith and Bailey set up a war room at the hospital and gathered the attendings to figure out what was going on with Richard. Unlike the others, Meredith was convinced it was not Alzheimer's. Together with Maggie, she ran some cognitive tests, which he failed miserably. When Richard disappeared from his room, she found him hallucinating in an OR, about to slice open his abdomen. She told him she could fix him as he was the one who taught her everything about surgery, life, and being a parent. She said she wasn't ready to lose him yet. Her talk brought him back to reality and he handed over the scalpel. As he slowly realized something was wrong with him, he addressed her as Ellis. She took him back to his room. Still convinced it was something other than rapidly progressing Alzheimer's, she sought out Andrew, who secretly had been working on the case, and had him show her what he had come up with so far. She told him they wouldn't leave until they figured it out and got to work.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nThe two of them spent days at the hospital trying to find the diagnosis with other doctors coming and going to help out. After a week of Meredith ignoring her home life, Maggie reminded her of how she herself had pushed her mother while refusing to accept the reality of her impending death. She thought Meredith was doing the same to Richard, refusing to believe it was Alzheimer's. Since Tom and Amelia agreed it was Alzheimer's, Catherine decided to take him home. Meredith found Andrew disrespectfully yelling at Catherine for her decision. She sent him for a walk and apologized for his behavior. Meredith then joined Catherine, Maggie, and Bailey to go discharge Richard, who brought up that his feet and hands were numb. Meredith then convinced Catherine to let her run an EMG, which showed impaired function. Tom and Amelia then changed their opinion and agreed to a nerve biopsy. Right before the procedure, Andrew barged in and knocked over the tray with instruments to stop them from performing the biopsy. He said Richard had received a hip replacement with cobalt, which could be deteriorating and leaking into his blood. Meredith drew blood for a test, which came back positive. She advocated with Bailey to let Andrew scrub in to watch up close despite his inappropriate behavior before, though Bailey stressed that he was on the thin ice. Link successfully removed the hip, which would solve the problems.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith finds a broken down Andrew.]]\nAfter work, Cormac complimented Meredith on her diagnosis and asked her for a drink. She asked for a rain check and walked off. She then found a broken down Andrew sitting at the nurses' station. He had completely fallen apart. She pulled him up and took him home.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nShe didn't feel comfortable leaving him at home by himself so she took him back to work with her the next day, leaving him to rest in an on-call room. She informed Carina, who hated that she and Bailey had pushed him to this point in spite of her warnings about his condition. However, they yet again had to push him past his limits when [[Erin Banks]], the human trafficking victim, showed up at the hospital again asking for him specifically. They had Andrew accompany her during the pre-op exams. Meredith and Bailey operated on her and they discussed Andrew during the surgery. As Bailey remembered her own struggle to accept her mental illness, Meredith advocated for Bailey not to give up on Andrew either. They staged an intervention with Carina, Richard, and [[Cynthia Cole|his psychiatrist]]. Meredith told him that caring so much and fighting as hard for his patients as he did was a strength. He broke down as he had failed to attain the most important goal in his life, which was not to end up like his father. Meredith convinced him to fight as hard for himself as he had done for his patients, at which point he accepted to get treatment for his bipolar disorder. Afterward, Meredith and Bailey walked [[Abby Banks]] to the ICU to be reunited with her long-lost sister.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> At some point during the day, she also met her [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|new nephew]] and left the new parents to fight about the baby's name.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs COVID- first hit the United States, Seattle was amongst the country's cities to be hit the hardest, forcing Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to quickly adapt to the new reality. With all non-emergent surgeries cancelled, Meredith was one of the doctors doing shifts in the special COVID- ICU, where she had to run codes all the time and where most of her patients kept dying suddenly and unexpectedly. Since visitors were no longer routinely allowed, she had to witness how these patients died without their loved ones, who had to be informed either by a phone call or by another doctor who was assigned to the visitors' tent outside. She developed a habit of reciting surgical steps in her head to deal with her claustrophobia in the PPE. While working shifts, she also tried to contact Andrew, who had disappeared without a word. With yet another death imminent, she called the patient's daughter to rush to the hospital to be able to say goodbye. Her frustration finally hit a boiling point and she destroyed a supply room. She was surprised when Andrew arrived, now an attending. He informed her he was doing well and had spent his time asleep at home to keep the mania from creeping back in. While she was glad he was doing okay, she told him to inform people on his whereabouts.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nOn one of her breaks, she went outside to catch some fresh air. She ran into Cormac and Jackson, whom she was jealous of for having operated earlier that day. Having overheard her talk with Jackson, Cormac paged her to scrub in with him when [[Frankie Morris]] was admitted with a tree branch perforating his recently transplanted kidney. She was delighted to get to do what she is best at again. While operating, Cormac inquired about her kids. She hadn't seen them in two weeks since she was quarantining away from home. Cormac hoped his boys wouldn't go out and break the rules like Frankie had done, though Meredith understood Frankie, remembering how she was as a teenager. They successfully removed the injured pole of the kidney and had Frankie admitted to the ICU. An exhausted Meredith then returned to the COVID ICU. She received a text from Cormac inviting her for a whiskey in his office, but didn't see the text because she had fallen asleep. She woke up when Andrew showed up to take over from her. She put up some resistance, stating she could keep going after the high of the surgery, but Andrew reminded her that a certain friend had once stressed the importance of getting rest. She asked if she was his friend now. He said that she had saved him, so she could be whatever she wanted to be to him. She then agreed to let him take over. However, she collapsed in the parking lot, where Cormac found her unconscious. Meredith herself was dreaming of a [[Meredith's Beach|beach]], which she had dreamt about before while taking short naps in the COVID ICU. However, this time, she was greeted by Derek from a distance.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nShe was rushed inside and a COVID test came back positive. She was admitted to a regular room on a COVID ward, where she used her connections to get her a tablet to be able to stay on top of the situation at the hospital. After four days, Meredith found that the hospital was nearly at capacity for COVID patients so she requested to be allowed to go quarantine in a hotel as she felt fit enough. However, as Teddy and Andrew were debating her request, she passed out again, yet again finding herself at the beach with Derek. She tried to reach him but woke up as Andrew and Maggie got her back into bed and rushed her to radiology for a chest CT. After the scan showed a dire situation, Meredith suggested they start her on triple antiviral therapy on which she had found an article. Meredith once again awoke from a beach dream when Amelia video chatted with little Ellis. Maggie tried to talk to her about her healthcare directive but Meredith brushed it off so she could talk to her daughter. Back on the beach, she tried to reach Derek but somehow always ended up back at the starting point far away from him. He yelled that she was worried about the kids and that the sand wasn't real. She yelled back that she missed him, which he knew. Bailey later came in to talk about the healthcare directive, pointing out that Alex would have to make rough decisions over the phone if things went south. Meredith insisted Alex would know when to pull the plug and asked Bailey to distract her instead. Later, she explained to Cormac that it was tough to pick a new POA as everyone was like family to her. He advised her to write down exactly what she wanted and then pick someone who would defend her choices, like his late wife had chosen her sister instead of him. Meredith then admitted she was scared she wouldn't wake up if she were to fall asleep, though Cormac was confident she was tough enough to beat the virus. Meredith ended up picking Richard as her POA. She explained she didn't want a ventilator as there was a shortage. Richard pointed out that she might end up as one of the people needing it and stressed that everyone at the hospital needed her. Meredith once again fell asleep as labs showed a worsening condition. She tried to reach Derek again, making a run for it, but she tripped and fell. From a distance, Derek laughed and told her he would be right there for her when she was ready.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith sees George.]]\nWhile sound asleep, Meredith found herself on her beach again, this time with [[George O'Malley]] present. She was delighted to see him and he backed Derek's statement that the sand wasn't real, nor was the ocean or his body. She commented on his looking older than when he had died, which he attributed to her imagining him that way being more comfortable for her. He revealed he had checked in on her and her kids sometimes. She asked if she could decide to go back to the world of the living but he didn't know. He said if he had had the choice, he would have chosen to stay. As they walked, they discussed how his death had devastated her and how she managed to move on from his and even Derek's death. He stated that, unlike her, his mother had become stuck in the grief over his death. In reality, Meredith's condition progressively worsened and as her power of attorney, Richard was tasked with the decision about whether or not to admit her into a trial. As he agonized by her bedside, Meredith became aware of his presence and she imagined him on the beach with her and George, who talked about what he missed about life. Richard talked about trying to stay strong for everyone worrying about her. Meredith apologized to him for that while George pointed out that Richard might break if Meredith decided to stay on her beach. \"I know, George,\" she uttered. Surprised by her sudden communication, indicative of how far gone she was already, Richard decided in favor of the trial.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and George have a heart-to-heart on her beach.]]\nAs they lied down on the sand, Meredith asked George if he regretted having chosen [[Amanda]] over himself. He dodged the question and said out she would have done the same thing, pointing out she contracted COVID- by working the frontlines and thus putting others above herself. She then told him that that was something she had him to thank for, as he had shown her how to go all in for people. He profoundly changed her life yet she never got to tell him that before. The two of them were joined by Richard and Bailey as Meredith became aware of their presence watching over her in real life.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith briefly woke up and was informed by Andrew that they had gotten her into the antibody trial. After having received the treatment, her oxygen needs dropped yet she remained sound asleep. Meredith was briefly joined again on her beach by Bailey, whose mother had been admitted with COVID as well. Bailey had kept from Meredith and Richard that her mother was suffering from Alzheimer's she didn't want to open any old wounds for them, yet with her mother dying, she found herself at a loss when trying to handle the big feelings that came with the impending death of her mother. Meredith tried to show support yet she was too weak to react to her opening up.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Meredith woke up and showed a spectacular recovery. Amelia came in to update her on her kids and Andrew was optimistic they would be able to discharge her within a week if she continued to improve at the current rate. Andrew later returned to her room and she asked for an update on the patient he had taken over from her. He reported only three of them recovered. Meredith wished she could help but Andrew stated that he didn't feel helpful despite his daily shifts in the COVID ward. He was then paged away. Later, Meredith was surprised by a visit from Tom, who had heard from Maggie about her miraculous recovery. Having bribed a nurse to wheel him to Meredith's room, Tom uttered that he needed to be in a room where no one was dying. He broke down and Meredith reached for his hand to comfort him. During a talk about why neurosurgeons are the best lovers, a code blue was called for a patient down the hall. Both of them missed saving lives and were frustrated about having to sit on the sidelines. They overheard that the patient didn't pull through.  As they talked about their kids, a nurse spotted Tom and brought him back to his room. She had a nap and was woken up by a beeping monitor from the patient across the hall. She pulled her own alarm to start a code blue, but when there was no immediate response, Meredith made her way across the hall and started compressions. She intubated the patient with the help of two nurses before the code team arrived. She then collapsed in Taryn's arms. A passed-out Meredith was scanned and her lungs showed significant damage, which Teddy didn't find surprising as the trial drug couldn't reverse damage that already occurred. She suspected Meredith had been on a COVID high and the exertion had pushed her over the edge. Teddy deemed that Meredith's lungs were at a breaking point and suggested they needed to put her on a vent. With more patients surviving recently after having been on a vent, Richard agreed with her suggestion. Meredith was moved to the ICU, where Teddy intubated her and put her on a vent. Meanwhile, Meredith found herself back on her beach, overlooking the ocean.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith remained comatose. She was joined on her beach by Andrew, who had been stabbed while tailing a [[Opal|human trafficker]]. Andrew questioned if they were alive. She thought that they were. They agreed the beach suited them both. Before she could ask, he told her he didn't regret what he had done. People go through life ignoring atrocities all the time but it makes sense to stand up and fight for people, like Meredith had shown him with [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabby]]. Andrew's condition worsened in real life. On the beach, he started building a sandcastle and Meredith warned him about the rising tide, a metaphor for his death. He was aware and worked fast to beat the tide. He said he had more to do, more plans in life. The water then destroyed his castle. Defeated, he admitted he had no clue what would happen now. Meredith didn't know either. He told Meredith he never felt seen the way she saw him. She made him want to be better. He felt small around her sometimes because he wanted something from her that only he could give himself. Being on the beach with her, he finally felt that true acceptance of who he was and what his strengths were. Meredith suggested they take a walk to watch the sunset, but he wanted to hold on to the feeling for a little while longer. With Andrew slipping away on the OR table, he and Meredith ended up watching the sunset. His mother appeared on the beach at a distance and called out for him. Realizing the moment had come, Meredith told Andrew she would miss him if she were to end up going back without him. He told her it would be okay. He realized he had to go now. He got up and eagerly ran towards his mother, who happily embraced him. Andrew briefly turned around and waved at her before walking off into the afterlife with his mother as Meredith watched him leave.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith's numbers slowly began to improve, Teddy began lightening her sedation and ventilator settings. Meredith continued to spend time with Derek on her beach, while Cormac sat by her side asking her to pull through since the hospital couldn't handle another loss after Andrew. Meredith found the obligatory distance between her and Derek to be torture, which he pointed out was her own doing. She brought up that he never got to meet Ellis, but he showcased enough knowledge about her and her resemblance to Meredith as well as Zola writing him letters to inform her that he had been watching over them. Derek also told her that if she wanted to get closer to him, she had to do that herself by relaxing. She tried that, which resulted in the two of them getting a little closer. Meanwhile, Meredith's numbers deteriorated, so Teddy turned back the ventilator settings. Cormac set up a video chat between Zola and a tablet in Meredith's room so Zola could talk to her mother. This as well as Cormac asking her to fight for her kids got through to Meredith and Derek on her beach. Derek told Meredith it was up to her but he advised her to listen to Cormac. She then let him in, replacing Derek on her beach. He talked about her kids and their traits and how they needed for her to fight. Meredith wasn't sure that she could since the beach was comfortable and pain-free. Cormac talked about he loss of his wife impacted their kids and again begged her to fight. Derek then reappeared and told her he would be right there for her. She then decided to fight and walked away from him. Cormac was delighted to see her move her head. He set up a livestream to Andrew's memorial service him, while Meredith herself began pulling away again as she went back to talking to Derek, the distance between them gradually decreasing.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith remained stable on the vent. She appeared in Teddy's subconsciousness as Teddy went catatonic at Andrew's memorial service. Meredith guided her to examine the causes for her behavior over the years, hinting that she had to look further back than her affair with Tom. Eventually, Teddy traced back the root of the issues to her guilt over the loss of Allison and other people in her life, including her parents, Henry, and Andrew, as well as Meredith barely holding on. Meredith told Teddy that all those people couldn't have been saved regardless of Teddy's actions. Meredith pointed out the losses had taught Teddy to run from pain as well joy for thinking she didn't deserve the latter. She said joy and pain are a package deal in life. Meredith got her to accept that. Teddy begged her not to die and Meredith said she would do her best.<ref>[[In My Life]], x</ref>\n\nAs her oxygen sats began improving significantly, Meredith was moved from the ICU to regular room with her ventilator. Her doctors were comfortable with getting her off the vent, yet feared that there would not be a ventilator available for her due to a hospital-wide shortage if she were to trend downward again. Meredith was visited on her beach by Mark and Lexie. Lexie asked her if she was going to stay. Meredith wasn't sure. Mark thought it was too early for her since Zola was only Sofia's age. Meredith told them about Derek but Mark said it wasn't up to him. As she watched Lexie and Mark frolic on the beach, she reiterated that she liked the beach. Later, Mark told Meredith it was nice to talk her, since most of the time people he tried to talking to didn't seem to hear him. Lexie asked Meredith about her favorite thing about life. Meredith replied it felt shallow to talk about that in the middle of a pandemic. Lexie pointed out that didn't mean she wasn't allowed to enjoy her life, stating that the having of a life and body was cause for celebration. If not, there was no point in avoiding death and she may as well just join Derek now. Meredith then told a story of Bailey made everyone laugh by faceplanting into his birthday cake. Meanwhile, Meredith was extubated and remained stable. Back on the beach, Meredith concluded that life is pain, with which Mark and Lexie disagreed. She cited her losses and all the pain in her life. Mark pointed out she knew what caused all the pain. Since Meredith couldn't bring herself to say it, Lexie said the depth of grief came from the depth of love. They advised Meredith not to fight change and resist pain, deeming it a waste of life. Meredith told them she missed them so much. Lexie said they never left her. Together, they told Meredith not to waste a single more minute of life.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\nSince Meredith still didn't wake up despite no longer being sedated and off the vent, Richard ordered a CT to find a possible underlying cause. The CT came back negative. Jo then came in to tell Meredith that she was changing specialties to OB because she needed to find job and her home life wasn't bringing her joy anymore. She hoped Meredith would wake up soon so she could tell her all that again while she was awake. However, she finally woke up later that day and told Richard that she was sorry he had had to decide whether or not to put her on a vent. He told her he would do it again in a heartbeat. Meredith then told him they needed to talk about Jo and shared what Jo had told her before. Soon after, she fell asleep again for the rest of the day.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nMoved back to the ICU, Meredith continued to spend most of the time being asleep. Teddy and Bailey tasked Levi with taking her to the hyperbaric chamber, which they hoped would help. They ended up having to share the chamber with [[James Chee]] and his patient. James asked Levi if Meredith really was as mean as he'd heard. Levi replied that he heard her voice with every win that he booked. He called her his most influential teacher, tough when need be. When the other patient's abdominal wound opened up, Levi handled the situation perfectly with Meredith's guiding voice in his head from when they handled a similar complication together before.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith improved and she was moved back to a regular room, yet remained at all times unconscious or asleep. Her vitals remained stable and imaging showed improvement, confusing her doctors as to why she wasn't waking up. Meredith herself spent more time on her beach with Derek where they talked about his death. He says the worst part was knowing the doctors were getting it wrong and eventually, the desire to rest outweighed the desire to stay. Meredith recalled the moment of giving him her blessing to go. Derek appreciated that she gave him everything he needed until his last breath. Meredith wanted to get closer to Derek yet knew she might never leave the beach if she did. She brought up his handling his father's death and said their children would be okay, too. As they brought up Amelia, Derek told Meredith that people love and need her. Derek knew Meredith was still fighting to live despite feeling tired, since her soul wouldn't let him come close. She inquired if it was hard for him to see her dating other men. He replied it was harder to see her lonely. He commented on her beauty yet acknowledged it felt shallow; she said she taught their children to say \"pretty on the inside.\" Meanwhile, Winston chatted to Meredith, wishing she would wake up to meet him and congratulate him on getting engaged to her sister. Her labs eventually showed elevated liver enzymes. A CT revealed a blood clot in her liver so Teddy and Winston carefully performed a TIPS procedure to remove the clot. \n\nMeanwhile, Meredith told Derek that Ellis draws about the two of them in traditional wedding clothes. As she told that story, they suddenly found themselves wearing exactly that. They held a little impromptu wedding ceremony. Meredith asked Derek what he wanted her to promise. He wanted her to torture herself less. They then leaned into a near-kiss while Meredith said she didn't want to leave the kids. After the procedure, Meredith's labs improved yet she still didn't wake up for hours. Winston then orchestrated a visit from Zola with Maggie and Richard's help. As Zola talked to her mother, all of her close colleagues gathered outside the room. Back on the beach, Derek told Meredith it wasn't her time yet. While she stated she enjoyed the beach where pain didn't exist, he told her he even missed the pain of being alive. He said she needed to go back to their kids. Meredith finally woke up as Zola was talking about allowing Ellis and Bailey into her room. Meredith faintly told her daughter that that was nice of her. Zola hugged her mother and said she loved her. Meredith then told her that \"they\" loved her, too. As the doctors celebrated, Derek walked away from Meredith as she finally chose to live.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith aced her respiratory exams and was prepared to be discharged while Bailey and Richard struggled to tell her about DeLuca's death. As they awaited her final lab results, Maggie and Richard took Meredith for walks down the hallways. Meredith was eager to finally meet her soon-to-be brother-in-law, whose dance moves Zola couldn't shut up about. As Meredith asked for more updates, Richard decides not to tell her about Andrew and told her that Jackson was leaving for Boston to take on a leadership role within the Fox Foundation. When the physical therapist cleared Meredith to go home, she started clearing out her room as Jackson joined her to say goodbye. Meredith said his departure officially made her the last man standing of their residency class. She recalled thinking he had a big name to live up to. Jackson said that name was ruined now but Meredith was confident he could make it his own and re-invent it. She then expressed desire not to face the traditional clap-out, where he planned for their final goodbye to take place. He encouraged her to let people celebrate the win. She told him to \"go give 'em hell\" in Boston and he thanked her for showing him how. Soon after, Richard and Bailey finally gathered the courage to tell her about Andrew. As soon as they brought up his name, Meredith had her experiences echo in her mind and told them that Andrew was with his mother. Meredith decided not to sit through the clap-out and had Jackson sneak her out through the back exit. They laughed as they got in his car and he drove her home. She surprised Amelia and her kids as they were preparing for her arrival. The kids finished their \"welcome home\" sign as they sat with their mother on the couch. Amelia swore they didn't spent months living a chaotic life like this. Meredith enjoyed the chaos and complimented Amelia on keeping her household running. She showed her profound gratitude as Link came rushing in to warn everyone about Meredith's arrival. Much to his surprise, she was already there. He fetched the donuts and Meredith had her kids fill her in on their lives.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref>\n\nDuring her first week of recovery, Meredith found Amelia hovering over her. She urged Amelia to go be of use to the world at work. The next week, Meredith started to be come more active. She was throwing a ball around with her son when Bailey visited. Meredith was exhausted from the activity and asked Bailey to talk about her life to distract her. After a month, Bailey dropped by to give Meredith a suture kit so she could get her dexterity back. Meredith had been reading up on the effects of long-COVID, which terrified her. Bailey tried to encourage her to talk a walk with her but Meredith wasn't feeling up for it. She said she'd never operate again if she couldn't stand on her feet long enough. Picking up her kids felt like running a marathon. Meredith was growing tired of people hovering over her and just wanted her old life back. Two weeks later, Bailey visited again and Meredith said Jackson and Tom had the right idea. She spent weeks fighting to get back to normal but she now realized that normal entailed sexism, racism, inequality, and substandard care. Bailey then proposed Meredith take over the residency program from Richard, who had too many jobs and would step back one day. She asked Meredith to put together a team that reflected their world and take over all the classes and shape them to sandblast bias out of the curriculum for future surgeons. Meredith accepted the job.<ref>[[I'm Still Standing]], x</ref>\n\nIn August , Meredith returned to work as residency director. She decided not to use Richard's infamous speech and instead jumped right in by asking the residents about the status of the newly admitted COVID patients. She later met Cormac in front of the OR board. He assured her she would be operating again soon, which she doubted. He then joked she could have just turned him down when he asked her for that drink rather than getting COVID. She commented that seemed like a lifetime ago and recalled him coming into her room to tell her to fight for her kids. Meredith left work early to attend Maggie's wedding in the backyard, which was postponed indefinitely mid-ceremony. \n\nA month later, Meredith met [[Gerlie Bernardo]], who was being discharged after having spent a month in the hospital with COVID. Having struggled with her own recovery, Gerlie found it reassuring to see Meredith back at work. Meredith sympathized with the residual symptoms Gerlie was experiencing, survivor's guilt being one of them. Meredith confided that that would never go away. Gerlie then collapsed and was re-admitted. Meredith took on her case and used it as a hands-on approach to teach the residents in a more practical manner, substituting the traditional grand rounds. Bailey was surprised with her approach to teaching but Meredith reminded her she was hired to change things around. However, during Gerlie's bronchoscopy, Meredith became dizzy and had to have Maggie take over.\n\nBy Christmas Eve, Gerlie had further deteriorated and had to put on ECMO on Christmas Eve. Meredith took to researching lung transplants in COVID patients. Cormac met her in the attendings' lounge and presented her with a half-empty bottle of whiskey. They finally shared their first drink. The next morning, Amelia, Link, Owen, Teddy, and their kids came over to Meredith's house for Christmas. During the celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy. As the new year began, the hospital received vaccines for the staff. Meredith began advocating for Gerlie to be put on the transplant list but Bailey shut her down, believing Gerlie would recover without the transplant. Meredith then had the residents continually press for the transplant whenever Bailey rounded with them. Bailey confronted Meredith about her tactics but Meredith stated that people suffering from the aftereffects of COVID needed advocates, too. Since she had learned that life could be short, she wanted to teach the residents what mattered most. Bailey then agreed to put Gerlie on the transplant list only if Meredith agreed to re-implement grand rounds.\n\nBy April , Meredith and her kids attended Winston and Maggie's beach wedding. Shortly after the ceremony, Meredith received words that UNOS had found lungs for Gerlie. Teddy and Meredith left the wedding to perform the surgery. As they got started, Meredith said it had helped for her to have a village of people pulling for her with every complication. Since Gerlie had no one, they had to be her village. Meredith rallied and finished the procedure without a problem. Post-procedure, they were met with a round of applause from the surgical staff for Meredith's recovery. As she sat by Gerlie's bedside, Meredith let Cristina know that she successfully performed a double lung transplant. Gerlie woke up surprised to see Meredith by her side; Meredith replied she wasn't going anywhere.<ref>[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter having fully recovered, Meredith and Cormac started seeing each other but their romance was short-lived since it caused his so Austin to suffer from panic attacks. Putting his children first, they quickly ended things.\n\nMeredith was invited to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota by [[David Hamilton]], a former colleague of her mother's, to attend the opening of a research library named after Ellis. While in Minnesota, Meredith was plagued by nightmares in which her mother challenged her to do more with her life than being a regular general surgery attending after having miraculously survived COVID. During her visit to the Clinic, Richard, Bailey, and Cormac called her to remind her of her ties to Grey Sloan and she swore she wasn't there for a job interview. Upon meeting David, he commented she was the spitting image of her mother and guided her to The Grey Center for Medical Research, a research lab he had begun to put together for Meredith if she were interested. He showed her around the lab and its extensive state-of-the-art equipment and explained he was developing cellular therapy for experimental surgery to cure Parkinson's disease. He had everything except a famous surgeon to convince the FDA to grant approval for a clinical trial, revealing that he intended for himself to be the first patient. David invited Meredith to dinner, where she noticed his tremor. David explained her name had become synonymous to cutting-edge and seeing things through to the end. She had him explain the idea behind the project and he stressed the opportunity to become the public face of a possible cure for Parkinson's disease. As she pondered his proposal, she saw [[Nick Marsh]] leaving the restaurant with his date. She told David she wasn't a neurosurgeon but he was confident she would attract the best talent for the project.\n\nUpon returning to the hotel, an employee escorted her to the bar where she found Nick waiting for her. He took a chance and guessed she would be staying at the five-star hotel near the hospital. Over drinks, he said he had spotted her back at the restaurant. His date was horrible. She shared she had just ended things with someone though that didn't mean the two of them would be sleeping together, which he was fine with. He updated her on Charlotte leaving for college and she told him she had survived COVID. He understood being a miracle was a lot of pressure, bearing the question of what you'll be doing with it. Nick walked her back to her room and she explained she would be staying a few more days to look at research. They wished each other good night and shared looks as he walked off. Meredith couldn't help but smile as she closed the door.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\nWhile up to get some water, Meredith heard something and found a note had been slid under her door. She quickly opened her door and called for Nick, who came back from around the corner. He had forgotten to ask for her number and wanted to ask her out on a date without waking her. She happily agreed to a date at a place by the lake. The next morning, Meredith had Amelia flown in from Seattle and informed her about the proposal as she showed her around the lab, stating she wanted Amelia to be part of the project if she were to accept it. After Amelia examined David, they went back to the lab where they met [[Kai Bartley]], a neuroscientist who had already boarded the project. Their work completely convinced Amelia, yet Meredith remained hesitant. Meredith questioned the influence the project would have on their kids' lives. Amelia said revolutionizing medicine would be a great example. Meredith remained on the fence about the consequences of a possible failure. Afterward, Meredith walked Amelia back to her car and thanked her for her input. Meredith locked eyes with Nick while Amelia kept talking about how on board she was with the project.\n\nAt the end of the day, Meredith found Nick waiting for her in the lobby in casual clothes while she had dressed herself up. She changed into something more comfortable. He took her to a favorite spot of his by the lake where he shared that he had cut back on his hours because he was starting to ignore the beautiful world around him. Meredith admitted she was, too. He asked her about the top-secret project she was in town for her. She admitted she was scared to say yes since it was risky, cost millions of dollar, and had the possibility of turning her into a public failure, while she had a safe and comfortable situation in Seattle. Thinking they were of similar nature, Nick knew she would trade all of that in for this project. No matter the outcome, it would be one hell of a ride. Meredith met up with David at the lab and set rules first. She demanded autonomy to pick her team and made sure any progress would be public and accessible to everyone. He agreed to all of those but refused to move the project to Seattle since it would cost them time he didn't have and even more money. Meredith then agreed to travel back and forth once a week. They shook hands as she finally accepted the proposal.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\n\nShe is intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, has good medical instincts, and a natural flair for medicine.\n\nMeredith and Derek have been described as polar opposites. She described herself as \"dark and twisty\" due to her negativity, in contrast to Derek's charismatic optimism. And unlike Derek, who viewed the world in distinct shades of black and white, Meredith tends to see things in shades of gray, which [[Carolyn Shepherd]] remarked to her son that was what he needed, while she was visiting Seattle.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Devil]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, this difference in viewpoints culminated in what was a breach of their marriage, when she messed up Derek's Alzheimer drug trial. She secretly accessed the pharmacy, where the trial drugs were stored, and subsequently swapped the placebo for the actual drug, for Patient #, aka Adele. And when busted by a drunk Alex, who had seen her behaving suspiciously, she much later confided in Cristina that she felt that her actions were justified, as Adele was Richard's wife, and she should do something since Adele was about to have saline injected into her brain, and the trial drug sample could help her from becoming a 'gorked out lump', in her own words. The couple subsequently got into an argument in the changing room, where Derek argued that it was Alzheimer's, a disease that she could potentially have, and one whose progression he was trying to stop or cure, while at the same time espousing that everything was black and white, a right and a wrong. Meredith responded that the situation was much more complicated than that, as it was Richard and Adele.\n\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\n[[Image:der-mer-sex.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Derek wake up after their first encounter.]]\nMeredith and Derek first met at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's Bar]] the night before her first day at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Derek approached her, they got drunk, before ending up at her place, sleeping with each other. When she went to work, she discovered, much to her shock, that Derek too worked at Seattle Grace, as an attending, so she staunchly refused to date him, although they did manage to sneak by a few stolen sexually charged moments. However, it was eventually at the unexpected house party that went out of control that she finally gave in and the two got intimate in the car. Despite Miranda Bailey, who felt that Derek was beginning to show signs of favoritism towards Meredith the following day, catching them in the act, the pair began to date secretly, something which her roommates would eventually discover, and thus were mostly not too pleased about as they thought she was trying to win favors and felt uncomfortable sharing living space with their \"boss's boss.\" They became public quickly, although [[Richard Webber]] discovered and disapproved of the relationship, knowing that Derek was still married to Addison. Their relationship temporarily ended when [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Shepherd]] arrived at the hospital for a medical case and claimed to be Derek's wife, thereby surprising her.\n\n[[File:Candles.jpg|thumb|px| Meredith and Derek's future house (made of candles).]]\nMeredith stayed away from Derek but later asked him to make a choice between her or Addison. Derek tried to make a decision, but it was a hard one, as he had been married to Addison for eleven years. He eventually chose Addison and Meredith was left heartbroken. Addison stayed at Seattle Grace and Meredith was left alone and when news of the scandal leaked out, she became much of the hospital's talking points and gossip. After avoiding each other, they attempted friendship, but on the night of the Seattle Grace prom, they had sex in an exam room despite the fact that Meredith was dating [[Finn Dandridge]] and Derek was married to Addison. An unexpected event of the secret rendezvous was Meredith losing her panties when Derek had pocketed them. The next day, Addison found Meredith's panties in Derek's pocket and realized her marriage was over. After Derek caught Addison and [[Mark Sloan]] together again, they both admitted their relationship was finished. He told Meredith that if she wanted, they could date and that he loved her. Meredith tried to choose between Derek and Finn, but when she was unable to decide between the two men, she decided to date both of them until she decided. After Derek decided to be a better person and let her go and be with Finn, she realized she wanted Derek and broke up with Finn. She didn't tell Derek immediately because he was going through his divorce with Addison but when she finally did, he no longer cared, as he was suffering from Addison's secret about her and Mark living together for months, after he had left her.\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek and Meredith get engaged.]]\n\nThey started dating again, but Derek later complained that she was constantly leaving him and that she should be worried that the highlight of his week was meeting another girl at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]]. When [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] and [[Preston Burke|Burke]] called off their wedding, she broke up with Derek, not convinced that relationships could work. They tried to stay apart but began having break-up sex, and mockery. Later, Derek kissed a nurse named [[Rose]] in the scrub room; when Meredith found out, she severed all ties with him. Derek and Meredith started a clinical trial but Derek began dating [[Rose]] and her feelings for him started to come back as the clinical trial continued. After their last clinical trial patient survived the surgery, Meredith and Derek celebrated and she showed him a house of candles she had made. He kissed her and they got back together. Trying to take steps forward, Meredith asked him to move in and he accepted. They stayed together and after his mother's visit, Derek decided to propose with his mother's engagement ring. Meredith originally thought he was avoiding her because of a conversation they had about babies, but he insisted that he wanted to have all her babies. Derek planned to propose to her, with a ring from his mother but remarked to Mark that the timing had to be right, otherwise she would bolt. Derek's plans to propose left his mind after he accidentally killed a patient. [[Richard Webber|Richard]] told Meredith about the ring, but the despondent Derek hit the ring into the woods, with a baseball bat. He apologized and she forgave him and he proposed properly to her later. They planned a wedding, but when they realized that Izzie had stage  cancer, they eventually gave their wedding to Izzie and Alex. With very little time to get married themselves, they went to the locker room, wrote down their vows on a Post-it note, and married each other.\n[[File:Postit.jpg|thumb|xpx|The post-it note that married Derek and Meredith.]]\nAfter their Post-it marriage, they referred to each other as husband and wife and in the days immediately after their wedding, they had sex frequently, while often getting caught in the act, in different places in the house, by those living there. Later, she found out she was pregnant. The shooting that happened after the death of a patient of Derek's, when the patient's husband shot numerous people, also shooting Derek was traumatizing for both of them, especially as Meredith miscarried because of the events of that day. She waited to tell him about this long after his recovery wondering how he would react. Then they proceeded to try to conceive, but they learned Meredith had a hostile uterus, which made it unlikely she would conceive naturally.\n\nEventually, the two did formally marry, as it would make it easier for them to legally adopt Zola, an African girl Derek got to know while treating her spina bifida. Derek engaged Meredith in his Alzheimer's clinical trial, trying to find a cure for her mother's disease. When Adele Webber became part of their trial, however, Meredith's emotions started to cloud her judgment, and as a result, she switched the placebo with the active medication, so Adele would get better. This caused Alex to become suspicious when he saw her acting weird. When Alex was drunk, he told Owen Hunt about this incident, who continued to alarm Derek and Richard. Derek then continued to become really angry at Meredith, accusing her of not knowing the difference between right or wrong and saying it wasn't any way to raise a child. It took them a long time to resolve these differences in their marriage and their separation caused trouble with Zola's adoption, for which each blamed the other. However, in times of crisis, they made up and all of them lived happily as a family after Alex, feeling guilty, managed to get them Zola back. Even after enduring the horrible plane crash, in which both her sister and his best friend died, and Derek's hand was severely injured, their bond only grew stronger and they helped each other. Meredith discovered she was pregnant with Derek's child. Though both of them were really happy, Meredith was very concerned due to her hostile uterus, but Derek remained optimistic, and she was still pregnant. During the \"superstorm,\" Meredith gave birth, via c-section, to a baby boy whom she named [[Derek Bailey Shepherd]] after both Derek and [[Miranda Bailey]].<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the birth of Bailey, Meredith and Derek enjoyed their time with their children. Eventually, Derek was offered a job with the president. At first, Meredith was upset as Derek promised her that she could kickstart her career but eventually grew not to mind. They were going to move to DC. but Meredith decided she wanted to stay, so Derek resigned from Grey Sloan.\n\nThe couple argued on and off over his new job and he moved to DC in the heat of the moment. He flew back and forth between Seattle and DC, putting a strain on their marriage. He eventually grew to realize that he was miserable without his family and wanted to be with them more than \"saving the world.\" Meredith also realized that she could live without him, but she didn't want to. They both became very happy once Derek moved back to Seattle. Meredith even told her friends that she had never been happier with her husband and kids. The two were lying in bed together the day before his death and Derek said that she was the one that saved him. On his way back to DC to resign, he got into a car accident and died.<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref> When Derek died, Meredith was pregnant with their third child, Ellis.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nAfter losing  patients to COVID-, Meredith had been more stressed out than ever, causing a breakdown and a trashed supply closet. Soon after, she was found in the middle of the hospital's parking lot, having collapsed. Suddenly waking up on a beach, Meredith tried to recollect what had just happened, but then a faint voice calls out to her in the distance. After staring long enough at the figure far away, she realizes that it's Derek, waving his arms and smiling. A shocked Meredith catches her breath in realization.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n[[Finn Dandridge]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith and Finn at \"prom\"]]\nFinn Dandridge was a veterinarian to [[Doc]], Meredith and Derek's dog. He met Meredith when Doc got sick and Meredith brought him in. He asked her out and she agreed, despite her and Izzie being celibate. They started a serious relationship and often had sleepovers. At the Seattle Grace prom, Finn said he had plans for his and Meredith's future. Meredith was happy and tried to make the relationship work. However, after an argument with Derek, Meredith ended up cheating on Finn with Derek. Finn found out, and albeit annoyed, he wanted to work past it. Meredith was glad, but she realized she couldn't choose between Finn and Derek, so she started dating them both at the same time until she chose. After a fierce competition, Derek decided to let Meredith go, but as soon as he let her go, Meredith realized she wanted to be with him. She broke up with Finn, who told her Derek was no good for her before he walked out for the last time. His nickname was \"McVet,\" as opposed to Derek's \"McDreamy.\"\n\n[[William Thorpe]]\nWhen William Thorpe and Meredith worked together on a patient, [[Brian Carson]], he flirted with her and asked to follow up with her. She initially didn't realize he was flirting, but once she figured it out, she went back and gave him her personal number.<ref>[[All Eyez on Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Will asks for Meredith's phone number]]\nHe then called her several times, but she didn't answer the phone. Still wanting to pursue her, Will came to the hospital and asked Meredith on a date in person.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith agreed to go get drinks, but panicked and canceled. However, he showed up at the hospital after she got out of surgery and offered to take her home. They got food and ate in the car, talking.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nOn their third date, Will and Meredith had sex. However, the morning after, Meredith yelled at Will, asking him to leave immediately. He later came to the house and she told him about Derek and said she thought she was ready, but she wasn't. He said he'd back off for a while and wait, but he'd call and then come back. He believed she was worth waiting for.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nNathan and Meredith were initially at odds, with her disliking him out of loyalty for Owen.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref> Due to Owen's stories, she began to notice he was prone to making rash medical decisions, and their opinions quite often differed. However, she has shown to be able to put her dislike aside so it wouldn't affect patients, or when Nathan told her his side of the story. When Meredith had a bad day, he confronted her about it in the parking lot. They started arguing and ended up having sex in her car.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> It happened four times, but Meredith didn't want him to get too attached to her. He claimed he knew they were just friends who had sex, but during Owen and Amelia's wedding, he smilingly looked at her, indicating he had started to feel more for her.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> Later at the wedding, Nathan and Meredith flirted and he asked her to dance, only for Maggie to interrupt and dance with him, leaving Meredith to watch the two.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref> Nathan continued to try to get closer to Meredith, and although she liked him, she kept brushing him off as she knew Maggie liked him too. Finally, Nathan showed up at Meredith's house, verbally confirming his feelings for her. Meredith lied to him, saying she didn't return the feelings, out of consideration for Maggie. Meredith also warned Nathan that Maggie was going to ask him out, which Nathan believed to be the reason Meredith rejected his pursuits.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex later noticed the way Meredith looked at Nathan, he encouraged her to go after him, but soon changed his mind when he and Nathan disagreed over a case. Meredith told Nathan that butting heads with Alex was not the way to pursue her. Later that day, Nathan told Meredith to stop listening to what people were telling her about him and listen to her own feelings for a change. He admitted he kept thinking about her and that he'd be all in if she wanted it to happen. He left her to think about it, and she decided that she wanted him to give her a reason to go for it. He spent an entire day trying to come up with her but instead told her about how he fell for her the first time he saw her. Meredith then told him to ask her out to dinner, which he did, and she said yes.\n\nHowever, their dinner plans were canceled when Maggie's mother's health took a turn for the worst and Meredith had to support Maggie throughout her mother's treatment. After Diane eventually passed away, Nathan and Meredith agreed that their timing wasn't right to start something between them and indefinitely postponed their dinner plans, since Maggie would heavily rely on Meredith in the near future.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Nathan and Meredith flirt at a dinner party]]\nMeredith and Nathan found themselves sitting next to each other on a plane, both heading to a conference. Meredith went to the bathroom, but Nathan followed her, intent on talking to her about their situation. They ended up having sex. After the plane landed and passengers were tended to, Nathan proposed that they get a hotel room and Meredith accepted.<ref>[[In the Air Tonight]], x</ref>\n\nNathan and Meredith began a relationship, which involved them telling Maggie that they were a couple, and Meredith began to open herself up more to Nathan. He slept over frequently, and Meredith even considered introducing Nathan to her kids over dinner. However, upon the discovery of Nathan's long-lost fianc\uee, Megan, who had been abducted  years ago when they were both in Iraq, Nathan and Meredith abruptly ended their relationship. Although Nathan tried to convince Meredith that he was still in love with her and that Megan didn't want to be with him, Meredith continued to send Nathan back to Megan because she didn't want Nathan to blow his opportunity to rekindle his romance with Megan. Eventually, Nathan moved to Los Angeles to start a new life with Megan. They ended on friendly terms with both of them thanking the other one for what they had meant in each other's lives.\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew drunkenly kissed Meredith, and she rejected his advances, though she told him she was flattered. The next morning, Meredith found herself dreaming about Andrew and was reminded of her thoughts when he apologized at the hospital for kissing her. Meredith continued to dream about Andrew as she began going on dates with the help of her matchmaker patient, [[Cece Colvin|Cece]]. Most of Meredith's dates did not end well while, unbeknownst to her, Andrew realized his feelings for her.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Andrew at Catherine's party]]\n\nWith the encouragement of Jo, Meredith asked out [[Atticus Lincoln]] for drinks, prompting Andrew to finally confess his feelings for Meredith. She told him she had to think about it, but that same day, they got trapped in an elevator during the wind storm. In the elevator, Andrew opened up to Meredith about his difficult childhood back in Italy under his famous surgeon father. Meredith revealed to Andrew that she speaks some Italian, and they grew closer, almost sharing a kiss before the elevator started working again. After working on a surgery together, Andrew proposed that he and Meredith go out on a date before they got interrupted by Link, who reminded Meredith that she had asked him out for drinks. Meredith realized that she was in another love triangle between Andrew and Link.\n\nSometime later, Meredith still hadn't made a decision, but she made a date with Andrew for Alex and Jo's New Year's Eve party. When she stood him up to monitor a patient, he began getting impatient over her indecisiveness. On Valentine's Day, Meredith asked Link out to dinner, but that night, Andrew took her up to the hospital roof for a drink, and the two shared their first kiss.\n\nBecause Maggie had dated Andrew years ago, Meredith wanted to get her approval before starting to date Andrew. When Maggie said she was fine with the relationship, Meredith allowed Andrew to take her out on a date, officially beginning their relationship. At Catherine Avery's party, Meredith and Andrew went off to make out in Jackson's guest room and were caught by Richard, exposing their relationship. Meredith also told Alex that she was dating Andrew, and Alex said that she should report their relationship to HR and that he hoped Andrew makes her happy. After Zola caught Andrew trying to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night, Meredith decided to tell her kids about her relationship with Andrew, which was received well. \n\nWhile working on a case together that involved Meredith committing insurance fraud so that a young immigrant girl could get a surgery she needed, Meredith spent the whole day thinking Andrew disapproved of her breaking the rules. However, he revealed that he was actually in awe of her bravery and that he was afraid of accidentally blurting out that he loves her. With this declaration, Meredith walked out without returning the sentiment and spent some time avoiding Andrew. She told Jo that the 'I love you' scared her because the last person she said it to was Derek. However, after Andrew took the fall for Meredith's insurance fraud and was put in prison, Meredith told him that, as much as it terrified her, she loves him too.\n\nDuring Meredith's trial, she lost her temper at one of the doctors on the panel, the one who'd killed Derek. This led Andrew to realize how much she had respected Derek, and although Meredith warned him not to compare, he didn't feel equal to her. He told her to take some time.\n\nCarina was concerned that Andrew might have the mania that their father had, explaining that that was why he went to jail for Meredith and why he was obsessing over Suzanne Britland's case. Meredith listened, as she already had concerns about Andrew's health, since he wasn't sleeping or eating. She went to Bailey who handed Suzanne's case to her. Meredith completely changed the treatment, which upset Andrew, but after receiving bone marrow test results, he and Lauren realized that Suzanne might have Still's disease. He administered steroids to her, which angered Meredith because if he was wrong, Suzanne would be killed. In the end, Andrew was right. Meredith confronted him about his reckless actions, which Andrew defended, and she brought up the point that he was acting like his father. He told her that he didn't need \"this\" and he didn't need her, breaking up with her for good.\n\n[[Cormac Hayes]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Hayes and Meredith getting coffee]]\nThey dated briefly after a long period of flirting until his son started having panic attacks due to his dating.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nick Marsh]]\nNick performed a kidney transplant at Grey Sloan as a visiting surgeon. When he was about to leave, he collapsed from his own recent kidney transplant and was admitted as a patient. Meredith treated him, and while they waited for his test results, they got to know each other. Later Nick thanked Meredith for saving his life. After work, Meredith told Alex that Nick made her feel something she hadn't felt since Derek, though it didn't matter because Nick lived in Minnesota.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\nYears later, Meredith saw Nick in passing at a restaurant in Minnesota when she was there to consult on another case. Later that night, he found her hotel, and they talked over drinks. He walked her back to her hotel room, and she didn't invite him in.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref> The next morning, he asked her out on a date. They went for dinner overlooking the river, where they talked about Meredith's new project.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith started officially working on the new project in Minnesota, she and Nick started dating. Meredith had trouble with the project's patient, Dr. David Hamilton, who is also on staff at Nick's hospital. Nick gave her advice on how to deal with Hamilton, and later that night, Meredith thanked Nick at dinner.<ref>[[Bottle Up and Explode!]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Nick and Meredith on a weekend getaway]]\nWhen Thanksgiving rolled around, Meredith was stuck in a hotel due to a snow storm. Nick was supposed to stay at his cabin, but when he heard that Meredith couldn't go home for the holidays, he turned around and joined her at her hotel. They ordered room service and spent the night before heading to his cabin the next day.<ref>[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]], x</ref>\n\nDuring one of her trips to Minnesota, Nick asked Meredith to help remove a tumor on one of his patients, but when things started to go wrong, Meredith found out that the patient was actually one of Nick's old friends, the one who had donated a kidney to Nick. She asked Nick to leave the OR because of the conflict of interest. They talked and made up after the surgery.<ref>[[Today Was a Fairytale]], x</ref> They kept dating, flying back and forth between Minnesota and Seattle to see each other. During one trip, Nick operated on a patient at Grey Sloan at Meredith's request, and afterwards, she introduced him to Maggie and Amelia.<ref>[[Living In a House Divided]], x</ref> After Meredith was offered a job in Minnesota, Nick offered that she stay and he move to Seattle to be with her. She started to get angry with him, claiming that she should be able to move and not be stuck at Grey Sloan. Because of the troubles with the teaching program at Grey Sloan, the two decided to stay for a couple weeks until the program was saved and then move to Minnesota.<ref>[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]], x</ref> \n\n\n[[Zola Grey Shepherd]]\n[[File:x-.png|thumb|xpx|Meredith bonds with Zola.]]\nMeredith and Derek met Zola when she was brought to the hospital for an operation as part of Alex's program. The couple had recently been told that Meredith had a hostile uterus and conceiving a child would be hard. Derek immediately bonded with Zola and suggested adoption. Meredith took a little longer to bond but eventually couldn't help falling in love with the child. However, Derek found out that Meredith tampered with his Alzheimer's trial just as the couple was granted temporary custody of Zola. When the social worker on their case, Janet, discovered that Meredith and Derek weren't living together, Zola was taken away from them for a time, during which Meredith and Derek rekindled their relationship. They were given a date to see a judge about the adoption after Alex went to the judge directly. That date was subsequently canceled and Janet told them that it was unlikely that it would end in their favor and suggested that they move on. Then, one night after a long day of work, Janet showed up at their door with Zola and told the couple that she was theirs.\n\n[[Derek Bailey Shepherd]]\nMeredith and Derek's son was a surprise to both because an OB/GYN had described Meredith's uterus as hostile. Meredith surprised Derek with a 'the world's best big sister' t-shirt for Zola to tell him she was pregnant. Meredith went into labor during the superstorm and had to have a C-section after injuring herself earlier from a fall on the stairs. With the lights out, Bailey performed the surgery, and to thank her, Derek and Meredith decided to name their son after her.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref> When Meredith visited her dad as he was dying, she told him Bailey said \"funny\" before saying something.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ellis Shepherd]]\nEllis was conceived before Derek's death. During her birth, Meredith was bleeding heavily. Zola called an ambulance, saving her. When Meredith visited her father before his death, she told him Ellis was really into hip-hop.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\n[[File:.Breakfeast.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith makes Lexie some breakfast.]]\nAlthough Meredith originally hated Lexie, she quickly realized that although she had reason to hate the idea of her, she had no reason to hate Lexie herself. Initially, she didn't like the way Lexie followed her around and seemed envious of her rapport with Derek. She claimed that Lexie was someone she never wanted to know, even denying that Lexie was her sister. However, after Bailey explained that Lexie probably thought she hated her, because of their family links, and after a traumatic day when Cristina brought Lexie home with her, Meredith made an effort to bond with her so they danced and drank tequila. The next morning, Meredith even tried to make breakfast for her and Lexie was so enthusiastic that she ate it, despite knowing she would have an allergic reaction. Lexie and Meredith didn't get too close, both having two different sets of friends, but they did eventually become friends which was made easier with the presence of [[George O'Malley]] who was good friends with both of them. Lexie gave up the apartment that she and George had rented, and moved into the attic of Meredith's house, where she occasionally bemoaned the fact that she didn\ut have a proper room instead. They later become so close, that Meredith gave Thatcher a piece of her liver because Lexie asked her to and she doesn\ut want her sister to feel the loss of her father, something of which she had experienced herself. She also sat with Lexie for  hours, after she has a PTSD breakdown and had to be committed to the psychiatric ward, against her will. And when Lexie got jealous over how April was all chummy with Meredith, she told her the reasons for that, and the fact that \"you're not crazy, you're a Grey and you're my sister, Lexie.\" At the end of Meredith's residency, Lexie died after the plane crash because she was stuck under the debris. Upon hearing of her death, Meredith cried hysterically.\n\nLater, Meredith obsessed over saving a patient's life when she had the same injuries as Lexie after being crushed by a car. At the end of the day, Meredith was talking to Cristina and simply said that \"Lexie's dead.\" From that, it appeared that Meredith had accepted the fact that Lexie was gone and was at peace.\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\n[[File:Ellissaysgoodbye.jpg|thumb|left|px|Ellis tells Meredith to be extraordinary.]]\n\nEllis Grey was the mother of Meredith Grey. Their relationship was strained due to Ellis's devotion to Richard Webber and her work, often forgetting about Meredith. Meredith was a rebellious teenager and she drank excessively and partied during college. However, while traveling in Europe, she received a call and was told that her mother had Alzheimer's. Meredith was made to look after Ellis and keep her secret from the rest who knew her. Ellis would rarely recognize Meredith but one day she woke up and was lucid, but it wouldn't last long, she found herself very disappointed in her daughter who was no longer driven, just \"happy.\" However, before she died, Meredith saw Ellis in a vision and Ellis hugged her and told her she was extraordinary and to continue being extraordinary. Later, Meredith found her mother's old diaries and used them to get to know who her mother was and she realized that she liked her and her mother was quite similar to her best friend, Cristina Yang.\n\n[[Thatcher Grey]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Thatcher apologizes to Lexie and Meredith.]]\nDue to Ellis and Richard's affair, Thatcher left Ellis and Meredith when Meredith was very young. Ellis asked him not to visit and Meredith did not see him again until she was in her thirties and she discovered he had another family. His wife Susan persisted in trying to get them to bond and they began to but when Susan died in surgery, Thatcher blamed Meredith, even going so far as to slap her across the face and asked her not to attend the funeral. Weeks later he arrived back at Seattle Grace and told her he was sorry and so proud of her but Lexie later informed her that he only said it because he was drunk and he did it all the time. Thatcher went into a program and he started making amends. He asked Meredith and Lexie to forgive him, Lexie hugged him and Meredith congratulated him and said good luck and then left the office they were in. Several months later, Thatcher came into Seattle Grace vomiting blood. He was found to have cirrhosis of the liver. He was told that to be put on the transplant list, he had to be sober for at least a year, but he had only been sober for  days. Lexie was not a match for her father's liver, but Meredith was. Willingly, she offers up her liver, not for Thatcher, but for Lexie's sake. Meredith then spent several weeks at home in bed, recovering from the transplant operation. When Thatcher quietly returned to the hospital, with bouts of pain, neither Grey knew, until Miranda Bailey informed them of his check-in. When he revealed that he had a young girlfriend, Meredith was actually happy for him and had to talk to Lexie, who was not too pleased with that discovery. Meredith later visited him in his house upon finding out he had less than a few days to live, and they talked until he passed away.\n\n[[Susan Grey]]\nSusan Grey was the second wife of Meredith's father, Thatcher. After Ellis Grey died, Susan reached out to Meredith and after a rough start, Susan and Meredith bonded. Susan would wash her clothes and make dinner for her and was like a surrogate mother to her. However, she came to Seattle Grace with the hiccups and she died during a relatively easy procedure, due to complications.\n\n[[Doc]]\n[[File:IzGeorgeMerDoc.jpg|thumb|right|px|Meredith and Izzie play with Doc.]]\nDoc was Derek, Addison, and Meredith's dog. She and Izzie rescued him from a shelter and brought him back to their home. Doc was very playful, but he became too much for Izzie and George who quickly demanded that he leave. Due to Meredith's friendship with Derek, Derek and Addison agreed to take him in. After taken to a vet, Doc was diagnosed with bone cancer. When his cancer spread, he was put down and Meredith and Derek agreed to bury him in his favorite spot on Derek's land. During her near-death experience, the very first being she wanted to meet was Doc.\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nMaggie is Meredith's half-sister, daughter of Ellis Grey and Richard Webber. She was adopted as a newborn and moved to Seattle and got a job at GSMH to know more about her biological mother, whom she only knew by name. Meredith and Maggie were immediately in conflict at work. Eventually, it came out that Maggie was Ellis' daughter. Initially, Meredith didn't believe it. The next day, Meredith, helped by Alex, matched the information about Maggie's birth with what she remembered and was able to access about Ellis' hospitalization, and she had to admit that Ellis Grey was actually Maggie's birth mother. After that, Meredith and Maggie ignored each other, but Derek pushed Meredith to make the first move with Maggie (like he had done for Lexie), so Meredith showed Maggie the old diaries of her mother that correspond to the period in which Maggie was conceived.  As time went on, Meredith and Maggie grew closer and now they have a good relationship.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAmelia is Meredith's sister-in-law through her marriage with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]. Their relationship has been rocky since Derek's death. Meredith finds Amelia annoying and doesn't really like her, but they both care for each other as a real family does. Amelia moved with Meredith to her old house after Meredith sold her and Derek's house. Despite a fall-out that resulted in Meredith kicking Amelia out of the house, Amelia continued to watch over her when Meredith was attacked. Meredith, in turn, was there for her wedding and supported her running away before the ceremony. When Amelia was diagnosed with a tumor, Meredith supported her and sat by her side in recovery, as Amelia had refused to call any of her family members. At the start of the pandemic, Amelia was on maternity leave with her son, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] and she and Link cared for Meredith's kids while Meredith worked and continued when Meredith contracted COVID.\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\n[[File:Persons.jpg|thumb|right|px|Cristina calls Meredith her person.]]\n\nCristina bonded with Meredith instantly and their relationship grew, resulting in Cristina and Meredith becoming best friends and each other's [[Person(s)|person]]. They were known around the hospital as the 'Twisted Sisters.' As such, there is very little that the two of them do not know, about the other, since day one of their internships. Meredith frequently talks about her problems with Derek, to her, and all the talk about her and Derek, have been a sore point with Cristina, at least a couple of times. She became Cristina's maid of honor during both weddings to Preston Burke and Owen Hunt. Meredith and Cristina also have several sleepovers at each other's houses, sometimes in Meredith's bed with Derek in it. As well as being one of Cristina's pillars of support, during when she suffered from PTSD, as a result of the shooting.\n\nThey bonded over a complex case on their first day, but the relationship was put to the test after Meredith was chosen for a surgery, instead of Cristina. However, they overcame the obstacle and their friendship grew. After Meredith and Derek's break-up, Cristina protected Meredith by asking Derek to stay away. Outside the hospital, they would hang out at Joe's bar, and in the hospital, they would help each other, wherever possible. Cristina was often there for Meredith during her worst times and vice versa. Meredith was the only person who knew about Cristina's pregnancy, and Cristina about Meredith's. When Addison came to Seattle Grace, Izzie and Cristina stole a patient from psych to make her feel better and when Meredith was put on Erica Hahn's service, Cristina selflessly gave Meredith lots of advice on how to impress Hahn.\n\n[[File:Old, new, borrowed, blue.jpg|thumb|px|left|Cristina gives Meredith something old, new, borrowed and blue for her wedding.]]\n\nThey had their first big fight after Richard Webber blamed Cristina for knowing of the interns' secret meetings and Meredith did not defend her. Although Meredith at first refused to believe Cristina was ignoring her, she eventually accepted it. The two spoke to each other as little as possible, and when they did, they would argue with each other, Meredith even insulted Cristina by saying that to some people things came naturally, but Cristina was one of the people that had to practice. However, after Meredith broke down after attending the execution of a murderer, Derek brought her to Cristina and they made up. They began to bond over [[Ellis Grey's Journals|Meredith's mother's old diaries]] and Meredith found herself comparing Cristina to her mother. When Meredith announced her own wedding, she chose Cristina as her maid of honor.\n\nAfter a fight with Owen, Cristina showed up at Meredith's house. They laid on the floor and talked about her problems. When Owen came to Meredith's house looking for Cristina, Meredith said, \"I already fixed her.\" And Cristina went home with Owen. Also, when both of their husbands were angry with them, Derek at Meredith for tampering with his clinical trial and Owen at Cristina for wanting an abortion, they leaned on each other. Cristina stayed at Meredith's house, both of the men away, and helped take care of baby Zola. They would sleep in the same bed and have routines in the morning.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\n[[File:GeorgeMerSTimeOut.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Meredith apologize during a time-out.]]\n\nFrom the moment [[George O'Malley]] met Meredith, he fell in love with her. Meredith however, was in love with Derek Shepherd so she never really thought about George as more than a friend. Only a patient and George's best friend [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] knew how he felt about Meredith. After a small push from Izzie, George decided to tell Meredith how he felt. Meredith had had a very bad day at work so when George confessed his feelings for her, she thought that maybe George was her guy and she had just overlooked him. They proceeded to kiss but during sex, knowing it wasn't right, Meredith burst into tears. George was humiliated and furious and for weeks, he refused to speak to her. Eventually, he accepted her apology, but admitted that he was partly to blame too, he had known how she felt about Derek and knew that she didn't love George. Their friendship continued and he moved back to her house. When George discovered that he had to repeat his intern year, he drew away from his group of friends, but things soon went back to normal. Meredith and George's friendship continued and was strengthened, as she was his resident. On George's last day at Seattle Grace, he was hit by a bus after pushing [[Amanda]] out of its path. When he was admitted, nobody could recognize him. Meredith was his doctor and she defended him in front of some of the other doctors. After he traced \"[[]]\" on her hand, she realized it was him and had him rushed into the [[Operating Room|O.R.]] George later died, and she and the other doctors at Seattle Grace attended his funeral. As the janitor cleaned out George's cubby, as they \"need(ed) space,\" Meredith realized that what had happened was real and broke down in Derek's arms.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\n[[File:MerIzCristinax.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith gives Izzie her wedding.]]\nMeredith formed a close bond with Izzie on their first day and her relationship with Izzie grew more so when Izzie and George moved in with her. Initially, Izzie was not pleased to know that Meredith was in a relationship with Derek, as she felt that Derek would be favoring her over the other interns, and thus giving her a much better career prospect. She finally learned that Meredith actually loved Derek, and it was not a fling. When George and Meredith were fighting, Izzie told Meredith she would be siding with George if they had to choose sides but fortunately, Meredith and George's issues were soon resolved. Izzie felt close enough to talk to Meredith about her relationship with George and how he pecked her like a chicken and when she discovered that Izzie and George were dating, she supported them. After Izzie was diagnosed with cancer, and when the condition relapsed and Meredith was informed, she and Derek gave their wedding to Alex and Izzie. However, after Izzie left Seattle Grace when she was fired prior to the merger with Mercy West, Izzie refused to answer calls from any of her friends and only returned when a former teacher of hers was sick and sought Derek's help at Seattle Grace. She returned later on after Meredith called her and told her Alex might be moving on, the same night that Alex slept with Lexie. Meredith decided that they should keep it between the three of them. Later that night, Meredith found Izzie cleaning out her old room, ready to leave for good after Alex dumped her. Meredith begged her to stay because this was her home, but Izzie told her that it wasn't. It was just a place she worked at and she could find a new workplace. Meredith was left speechless and walked away.\n\n[[Alex Karev]] \n[[File:AlexMeredithThanksfortheMemories.jpg|thumb|right|px|Alex and Meredith talk.]]\nInitially, Meredith disliked Alex, after he insulted her on the first day of her internship, by calling her a nurse. But when he became Bailey's intern and Izzie made friends with him, Meredith gradually lessened her dislike of Alex. After discovering that Alex failed his board exams, Meredith helped him to study and they occasionally have heartfelt and meaningful conversations. When Izzie was revealed to be quite sick, Meredith offered her wedding to Izzie and Alex and Alex made her his best man for the wedding. When Izzie left the hospital after being fired, Meredith became a source of support. She rang Izzie to tell her to come back because Alex might be moving on, after witnessing Alex and Reed flirting and the next morning she found Lexie and Alex in bed together but advised them to keep it secret. There is no sexual attraction between the two, as shown when Meredith sits in the bathroom and has a girl talk with Alex. while he is in the shower. When Derek walks in and looks at the two of them, she explains by saying he's being a girl for her right now.\n\nHowever, that friendship may have run its course, seeing as how he had sold her out, while in a drunken stupor, to Owen Hunt, while the residents were all in the race for Chief Resident. Meredith subsequently confronted him, in a fit of anger, telling him that she probably will get fired and that she wanted him out of the house by the end of the day. And while he was actually updating the adoption agent, on the medical status of Zola, Meredith had the misconception that Alex was trying to ruin her chances of adopting the child.\n\nHowever, it appeared that with Alex's apology, they mended their fences and went back to their former relationship, as he was there to provide some physical support after Meredith learned that Zola had to be surrendered to Social Services for the time being. Cristina told Alex to help Meredith with trying to keep Zola from being taken from her because Meredith was the only one who \"gave a rat's ass\" about Alex. Alex also spilled to Cristina that she and Meredith were all he had and that they were his family, and that realization made him help Meredith and attempt to get Social Services to let Meredith keep Zola. With the departure of Cristina, Alex became Meredith's new \"person\" and the closest thing to a brother she had.\n\nAfter the death of Derek, Meredith left Seattle without telling anyone where she was going. Despite numerous calls from Alex, she refused to answer. She eventually FaceTimed him, saying that she and the kids were fine and she wished he would stop calling. When she later gave birth to [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], there was a problem and he was her emergency contact person, so the hospital called him and he came to San Diego to see her.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMeredith and Mark first met when Mark came to Seattle Grace to work on a patient. Mark didn't know that Meredith ''was'' Meredith and flirted with her and and soon as Derek saw, he punched him in the face. Mark and Meredith started talking about their problems as their common factors were that they were the Dirty Mistresses of Derek and Addison.\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Sadie returns to Seattle to Meredith.]]\nSadie Harris was Meredith's best friend and she too hated Ellis. Following her graduation from college, when Meredith was in her twenties, she left to go traveling around Europe for two months with Sadie where they partied and drank frequently and experienced some of the adventures of \"Death and Die.\" They had a big fight in Amsterdam, and though they made up and stayed friends, their friendship never truly recovered and they were never as close again. When Meredith received a call about her mother, she left Europe and went back to Seattle. Years later, Sadie made a surprise visit to Meredith's house and became an intern at Seattle Grace. Sadie and Meredith picked up their friendship as though no time had passed, causing Cristina to be extremely jealous. However, when George alerted the chief that Sadie did not seem to have much medical knowledge, she quit and asked Meredith to leave with her. But Meredith said she had a life now and could no longer be sleeping her way through Europe. Sadie told Meredith that the hospital had changed her, but the latter replies that wasn't true: it simply changed what she wanted, and now she wanted to stay in Seattle Grace. Then Sadie left.\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nJackson moved to Seattle Grace through the merger with Mercy West. At first, Meredith did not like Jackson very much. Later, when she found out he was related to Harper Avery, she felt empathy for him. They became friends because she knows what it feels like to have a famous relative. Jackson and Meredith have developed a nice friendship and they are usually nice and happy around each other.\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nWhen April first came to Seattle Grace, Meredith did not approve of her. When April came back after being fired, Meredith liked her even less, because she was way too friendly to Derek. Later, when Derek got shot, Meredith said that April didn't have the right to cry because of Derek, but she told Meredith that Reed, her best friend died. Meredith ended up comforting April, creating a bond. Later, Meredith let April and Jackson move into her house, and she admitted to liking April more and more, after she went off on a tirade, after being continually teased for being a virgin the whole day. Meredith and April appeared to have a relatively friendly relationship, with April often turning to Meredith for advice, and Meredith genuinely being kind to her.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n[[File:CallieClaimsMeredith'sPanties.jpg|thumb|right|px|Callie claims Meredith's panties to protect her.]]\nAlthough Callie and Meredith were friends, they were never great friends. Meredith allowed Callie to move into her house for a while and Callie saved her from embarrassment at work and gave her advice about her dog, but Meredith was better friends with Izzie, who disliked Callie, so she often sided with Izzie in arguments. After George and Callie divorced, Callie moved in with Meredith's best friend, Cristina, so she and Callie bonded a bit more and both of them protected her from Owen Hunt when they thought he might hurt Cristina, after he choked her, while he was asleep. Callie played a big part of Meredith's career at the end of her residency, helping her study for the surgical boards that all th years take, helping Meredith pass. Callie and Meredith also have the common bond of being mothers, which has helped their friendship a great deal. Meredith also helped Callie with her separation from Arizona, the custody hearing, and even comforted her after she lost sole custody of Sofia to Arizona.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\n[[File:RichardandMeredithForgiveEachOther.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Richard forgive each other.]]\nMeredith Grey and [[Richard Webber]] had a very strained relationship for a very long time. He was the main cause of her parents' divorce and because of him, she was always cast aside. Upon coming to Seattle Grace, they acted civilly, but there were issues under the surface. Because he had been so close to Ellis, he felt close to Meredith, and he was close to her as a child and she thought that he thought he was her father. After she started disregarding his authority, Richard realized that although he was not a bad man, he was the bad man in her story. Richard started becoming frustrated with Meredith and even more so when he looked at her and was frustrated to see [[Ellis Grey]] inside her, the woman whom he loved but had almost ruined his marriage. He never looked Meredith in the eye and eventually, Derek Shepherd spoke to them both. He told Richard that he was the most professional man except for when it came to Meredith Grey, who he didn't always treat as a colleague. Richard apologized to Meredith for his actions in the past, he had been aware that she had grown up alone but never tried to stop it. The two forgave each other and it was proven by his fatherly behavior towards her during her solo surgery and her offering him the diaries of her mother. Meredith later tells a shooter that he should kill her because she is the closest thing Richard has to a daughter. Most of the doctors in the hospital acknowledge Richard and Meredith's relationship, often getting her to use her dead mommy connections to get something.\n\nMeredith also helped get Richard and Catherine back together after their fight.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nMeredith and Owen have had a turbulent relationship, as they have often clashed over Cristina, whom they both care about very much. In the beginning, Meredith was supportive of Owen and Cristina's relationship, but after he strangled Cristina during a PTSD nightmare, she gave him the cold shoulder and kept him away from Cristina. After they got back together, she was civil to Owen for Cristina's sake, although the two shared a few arguments over how to handle Cristina, as Meredith claimed to know her better than Owen did. The cold peace between them finally came to a stop when Meredith learned that he had cheated on Cristina, which resulted in her despising him for a long time. However, Cristina made her accept that she would decide her fate with Owen herself, and Meredith would just have to deal with it. Afterward, her relationship with Owen got better, and upon Cristina's departure, she considered Owen as her friend and promised to be his person for Cristina. That promise soon came to use, as Nathan Riggs' arrival to the hospital caused Owen to become moody and isolated, prompting a worried Meredith to turn to his mother, who revealed her the truth behind Owen's mood.\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nWhen Meredith was publishing her abdominal wall transplant, she wanted to put Jo's name on the paper, but she also needed a picture, and Jo couldn't give a picture because then [[Paul Stadler|Paul]] would find her, so she asked Meredith to take her name off of the article. From that point on, Meredith was very protective of Jo and was even nice to her when [[Alex Karev|Alex]] asked. Then when Paul surprised Jo at the hospital, Meredith was there to comfort her and to keep her safe from Paul. She comforted her by saying \"You're Jo Wilson. I know exactly who you are.\" Meredith kept Alex from Paul, so Alex didn't kill him, and Meredith sat with Jo while she was signing the divorce papers. She also protected her when Paul came back and was threatening Jo for talking to Jenny, Meredith \"called security\" even though the phones weren't working. After that, when Meredith was dealing with the mini spleens in [[Judy Kemp]], Jo wished that a mini-spleen situation would happen for a useful organ, which gave Meredith the idea for her contest entry: mini livers. Since Jo helped find an important piece, she put Jo as her partner for the contest, and they created their mini livers together. After Jo's return to the hospital, Meredith has taken on a sisterly role to Jo, helping her out whenever she needs help.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\n[[File:IntoYouLikeATrainMerBailey.jpg|thumb|left|px|Bailey addresses a drunken Meredith.]]\nBailey was Meredith's resident and had earned the nicknamed \"The Nazi\" before Meredith had started at Seattle Grace. She rarely got involved with people and their problems, unless it affected their work. When [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] found out about Derek and Meredith's relationship, she didn't speak to Meredith and would punish her, by sending her nonsurgical tasks, to even up the playing field when she felt that Derek was favoring her. However, after their break-up, when Derek tried to talk to Meredith, Bailey grew protective and told him not to, that Meredith was hurt and he would just make it worse. Bailey taught Meredith and the interns with a tough-love method. And as the interns became residents, Bailey became friendlier to them, often dispensing advice and chastisement when needed, while still managing to maintain her fearsome professional reputation as a doctor and general surgeon. She attends Derek and Meredith's Christmas dinner to impress her father, and shows a motherly protection over Meredith.\n\nHowever, upon learning of Meredith's tampering with Derek's trial, she voices her strong disapproval of her, as evidenced from her interactions with Meredith, when she got fired, and the Chief, when asked to write a recommendation letter for her.\n\nWhen a storm hit the city, Meredith went into labor and had started bleeding internally after giving birth. All of the surgeons were busy except for Bailey, who at the time was not operating because of her recent MRSA scare, but ultimately decided to save Meredith. Meredith's baby was named after Bailey.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\n[[File:AddisonhugsMeredithx.jpg|thumb|right|px|Addison hugs Meredith.]]\nWhen Addison came to Seattle Grace although she wanted Derek back, she was civil to Meredith and even defended her in front of a mislead patient. In a scrub room, Addison told Meredith that if there was even a chance that Derek still loved her then she wasn't leaving Seattle but she would if he didn't. Derek chose Addison over Meredith, but when Derek and Meredith decided to be friends, Addison tried to be friends with her, too. The three stayed friends, even taking in Meredith's dog, but Addison sometimes felt a tension between the two and realized that everybody knew Derek loved Meredith, except for Derek and Meredith. She and Derek eventually divorced but after a short while, she managed to have a friendship with both of them. The relationship was proven when she came back to Seattle for a visit and hugged Meredith, although she was quite annoyed, and quite tempted to kick her ass physically, after learning that Meredith was letting Derek go off with Rose.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhen Mark first met Meredith, he flirted with her and was punched in the face by Derek. Privately, she labeled him as \ucMcSteamy\ud, and Mark called her \"My Favorite Dirty Mistress,\" while she was high on morphine for pain management. But when he asked her out, she said no because she loved Derek. When Derek forgave Mark for breaking up his marriage and they resumed their friendship with him, Meredith too became friendly towards him, although Mark still threatened her, only half-jokingly, on her wedding day. He later dated her little sister against her wishes, which caused a fight between him and Derek. When the plane crashed and killed Lexie, both she and Mark were left shocked and distraught with Meredith crying hysterically and a depressed Mark had a heart complication.\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\nBecause Burke was dating Cristina, Meredith and Derek were often invited over to their house for dinner and vice versa. She tried to mediate and fix things between Cristina and Burke, after Cristina went to Chief Webber about the tremor in Burke's hand, but to no avail. However, Burke left Cristina on the day of their wedding and there was never any contact between them again.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\nWhen Erica Hahn was hired at Seattle Grace, she almost immediately assigned Meredith to her service in order to see if Meredith had any of her mother's skill. She was impressed by Meredith but when Meredith lied and said she had performed a certain surgery when she hadn't, Hahn told her that if she did it again, she'd never let her operate in her OR again.\n\n\nAfter attending medical school, Meredith secured a spot at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] as a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] and moved from Boston to her mother's house in Seattle. She attended [[Dartmouth College]].\n\nBecause of her mother's reputation, Meredith was often treated differently from other doctors, sometimes favored and sometimes disliked. Meredith showed promise as an intern, she made a difficult diagnosis on her first day and during the rest of her internship, she assisted in several advanced procedures, particularly [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] cases.\n\nAfter correctly diagnosing a patient with a brain tumor, she approached Derek Shepherd with the idea of a clinical trial. On their thirteenth patient, they had a success and the clinical trial was published in a medical journal and named ''The Shepherd Method''. But she was not too pleased, to find that she was not mentioned in the article and was somewhat upset to hear from Derek that he was the one taking the risk, despite her doing all the work.\n\nSoon after, Meredith discovered numerous journals belonging to her mother, while she learned more about her and also picked up some surgical skills and even a doll from her past, Anatomy Jane, which helped her save a young girl.\n\nOn her wedding day, she was given a colon removal operation, from Derek, as her first solo surgery, as a wedding present. Without any intervention from other doctors, she successfully completed the surgery, despite Richard and Mark observing in the background. Richard Webber informed her that her mother would have been proud, while Meredith said that her mother was likely to have been glad that she didn't kill anyone instead.\n\nShe later also performed a solo neurological surgery by herself, as Derek, the attending doctor, was occupied by another patient in another OR. When Derek was setting up the Alzheimer's trial, Meredith was there to assist him. But she was not entirely pleased to find out that he chose Alex, over her, to help him. It was only later, that Alex explained that Meredith was more suited to be his assistant, as she had personal experience, in dealing with the patients and family. But when she tampered with the sample that Adele was supposed to get, Alex suspected that something was amiss. That culminated in him outing her, while he was drunk, and her being suspended, before being fired by the board. Richard took the fall for her, but she and Derek agreed that they shouldn't be close at work too, so Meredith decided to leave neurosurgery.\n\nElecting [[General Surgery|general surgery]] as her [[Surgery#Surgical Specialties|specialty]], Meredith passed the [[Board Certification|boards]] and is now the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[General Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. \n\nShe is also one of the Board Directors at Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\n\n*Meredith's Catch Phrases/Running Gags:\n**.

So, I forgive you.|'''Lexie Grey''' to '''[[Meredith Grey]]'''}}\n\n'''Lexie Grey''' was the daughter of [[Susan Grey|Susan]] and [[Thatcher Grey]] and half-sister of [[Meredith Grey]]. She was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] until she died in the [[Plane Crash|plane crash]]. After her death, the hospital was renamed after her and [[Mark Sloan]], the two fatal casualties from the plane crash.\n\n\n\nLexie was the daughter of [[Thatcher Grey]] and his second wife, [[Susan Grey|Susan]]. She had a younger sister, [[Molly Thompson|Molly Grey-Thompson]]. She also had an older half-sister [[Meredith Grey]], born to Thatcher and his ex-wife [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]], a famed surgeon. As a child, she was bright and skipped third grade. When she turned seven, her parents threw her a surprise party, which she always remembered as one of her best birthdays. She was very popular in high school, having a great group of friends, being crowned prom queen, and being class valedictorian. Near the end of Meredith's intern year, Thatcher mentioned to Meredith that Lexie was in medical school and that she soon had to choose a residency spot.\n\n\nWhen her mother Susan died of complications of the hiccups, Thatcher took to drinking and soon became an alcoholic. Despite this, Lexie stayed with her father and continued to care for him, even though he would often unreasonably and randomly lash out at Lexie.\n\nBy the time of Susan's death, both Lexie and Molly knew about Meredith's existence, though Lexie had never met Meredith before. On the day of her mother's funeral, Lexie waited in the car while Thatcher, accompanied by Molly, went to tell Meredith that she wasn't welcome at Susan's funeral, again missing the opportunity to see her older half-sister. After the funeral, Lexie went to Joe's bar where she offered to buy Derek a drink. He was visibly charmed and called her forward, to which she replied that she had a bad day, so she got to be forward today. He confessed to having had a bad day too but decided not to have a drink with her because he was there with some friends. They both agreed it was too bad, showing interest in one another.<ref>[[Testing --]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs Lexie started her internship, she met [[George O'Malley]] while he was cleaning out his locker in the interns' locker room. They quickly bonded and became friends. They even [[The Crapartment|moved in together]] after George's relationship with Callie ended. Lexie started having feelings for George, which he did not reciprocate. She called him out for not treating her better while she had always been there for him.\n\n\nWhen Lexie found out that she had a sister through her father, she began to have fantasies of getting along with her. Soon, she went to [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]] for her residency in hopes of meeting her. While Meredith did not appreciate Lexie's presence at first, over time, Meredith eventually tolerated her and accepted her as a sister. Lexie also confronted Meredith about her mistreatment of her on quite a few occasions, all with the good intentions of letting Meredith get to know her. After a very long time, Meredith began to care about her, and eventually admitted that she loved Lexie.\n\n\nWhile not part of the original group of interns practicing on each other, Lexie [[Rise Up|caught]] her fellow interns under Yang performing simple procedures on each other. Initially creeped out by the thought, Lexie tried to get cadavers for them to practice on, instead, but even these were stolen by their residents. Realizing that she wasn't learning enough from Cristina, she eventually joined the secret intern society, and the group soon grew as more dissatisfied interns joined.\n\nWhen Cristina and Meredith [[These Ties That Bind|suspected]] that she was cutting herself, she tried to shut down the group temporarily but was quelled by the new and enthusiastic member [[Sadie Harris]]. They were eventually found out by Cristina, who let them off with a warning. When Sadie told her that Meredith thought she was a priss, Lexie [[In the Midnight Hour|suggested]] that they perform an appendectomy on [[Steve Mostow|Steve]], who disapproved, but Sadie volunteered to take his place. However, the operation went wrong and she went to Meredith for help. After being discovered by the [[Richard Webber|Chief]], she and all the involved interns were put on probation by their residents and banned from surgeries.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Lexie and George]]\nLexie met George at the end of his first year as an intern,<ref>[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]], x</ref> and kept it a secret when she found out George failed his intern exam and had to repeat his intern year. They became good friends and even rented an apartment together. Lexie, however, began to see George as more than a friend, and while they became incredibly close, George did not see her the same way, so Lexie was constantly disappointed by George's lack of response to her signals and seeming unawareness to her feelings. \n\n\nLexie first came up to Alex one night when they were leaving the hospital. She initially asks for something more and Alex catches on and tells her that he's not that kind of guy. He tells her that he's the guy that people go to for the one-nighters and solely for the sex. Eventually, they do have it, in Alex's room that he's living in under Meredith's roof. She catches them in the act which unnerves Alex a bit. Later on, we occasionally see the two exchange kisses from time to time and go out to Joe's. In the resident locker room, Alex is caught in a 'feud' between the sisters. He says he won't continue messing around with Lexie because he doesn't want to be a part of their quarrel. Saying that he's not taking a side by refraining from messing around with Lexie, she says he clearly is. Then, Ava comes claiming she wants to see Alex perform surgery. He finds her a pair of scrubs and allows her to sit on the observatory deck while he surgically removes a man's sternum with the help of Dr. Hahn and Dr. Sloan. Lexie meets Ava and asks if she's here for Sloan, but Ava says no, she's here for Alex. She asks Lexie if she knew Alex and Lexie replies with \"No, I have no idea who he is.\"\n\n\nTo Mark, Lexie was \"forbidden fruit\", because she was Meredith's little sister and a \"fetus\", due to their large age gap. That's how she got her nickname '''Little Grey'''. Lexie came up to Mark and told him that the other interns were trying to take their mind off their so-called secret intern surgeries by having sex, but instead, she wanted to learn and asked him to teach her. Mark thought this was inappropriate, but let her be on his service on \"cappuccino duty\". Later that day, Lexie came up to his hotel room, took off her clothes, and said, \"Teach me\".\n\n\nMark and Lexie's relationship started to get troubled when [[Sloan Riley]], Mark's pregnant -year-old daughter, turned up at the hospital. Despite having a distant relationship with Sloan, Mark grew to become a caring father for his daughter. Since she was not ready to be a good mother for her baby on her own, Mark offered her to move in with him permanently so they could raise the baby together. Lexie confronted him and told him that she was not ready to start a family and be a grandmother yet. He begged her not to make him choose between his daughter and grandson and her, because, as Lexie figured, he'd choose for his daughter and grandson. This caused her to end the relationship with him.\n\n\nAfter Mark and Lexie broke up, she began a short relationship with Alex when she moved back into Meredith's house. They hooked up that day since Alex was missing Izzie as well. The relationship did not last long, however, as Lexie soon got back together with Mark.\n\n\nShortly before the shooting, Mark realized his feelings for Lexie. After Teddy broke things off with him, Callie told him that his jealousy was showing and was a sign he still loved her. He confessed his love for her and told her that she should choose him instead of Alex since he would marry her. She didn't have much of a response since Alex interrupted Mark's confession.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref> During the shooting, Mark and Lexie worked together to save Alex, who had been shot. Lexie told Alex she loved him, but Alex asked for Izzie, confused.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref> Ultimately, the two broke up. After the shooting, Mark took care of her and told Callie that he wanted to marry Lexie, but she persuaded him not to go to Lexie and propose.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref> Lexie thought that Mark's drive to bring her away from the OR was since he thought she wasn't stable after the shooting, but April told her that it was because he loved her. Lexie went to find Mark but found him kissing [[Amelia Shepherd]].<ref>[[Superfreak]], x</ref> Later on, Mark asked Lexie for a drink, which Lexie did her best to avoid. Even though she tried not to, Lexie went to Joe's and kissed Mark, which starts their relationship again.\n\n\nWhen Lexie broke up with Mark, she was feeling hurt and started a relationship with [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] until he realized that she obviously still had feelings for Mark. Unwilling to wait for her, he broke up with her.\n\n\nWhen Meredith and Derek agreed that the solution to their relationship troubles was for Meredith to stop being on his service, Lexie took her place as his resident. Hence, Lexie spent a significant amount of time on Derek's service. She was initially intimidated by Derek due to his exacting standards and quirks, once even asking Meredith to go \"have sex with him and make him nicer.\" Meredith would give her tips on how to get on his good side. Lexie and Derek tackled a number of hopeless cases together. \n\n\nShe was on a plane that crashed with [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], going to another hospital for surgery to separate conjoined twins. Suddenly, the back of the plane broke off and the plane crashed in the woods.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Mark finds Lexie trapped under the plane.]]\n\nA piece of the plane landed on top of her, crushing her pelvis and legs. Separated from the others, who were in the front part of the plane, she used a belt and knocked it against the piece of plane crushing her. Meredith, Cristina, and Mark followed the sound and found her. They concluded she was still awake and responsive, and an emotional Meredith went off to find Derek, who was still missing. Mark and Cristina tried to lift up the part of the plane, but without success. Lexie told Cristina her legs and pelvis were crushed and was doubtful if her left arm was still there. Mark yelled at Cristina to go get fluids and oxygen tanks from the plane, and even though both she and Lexie realized that Lexie was dying, she left to get the supplies.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Mark telling Lexie he loves her.]]\n\nWhile waiting for Cristina to come back, Lexie asked Mark to hold her hand and tell Meredith that she was a good sister. She also wanted him to tell something to her father, but Mark refused as he didn't want to accept that she was going to die. After once again unsuccessfully trying to lift the part of the plane on his own, he realized there was nothing he could do for her, and he did take her hand. He confessed that he loved her, and Lexie said that he didn't have to say it just because she did, but he insisted that he loved her. They fantasized about how they would get married and have kids, specifically a sister and two brothers, as siblings for Sofia. Mark said she couldn't die, as they were supposed to end up together. He told her that they were meant to be. \"Meant to be,\" she repeated with a smile. She then succumbed to her injuries, and a crying Mark closed her eyes with his one hand as he kept on holding her hand in his other hand. Seconds later, Meredith and Cristina appeared and they mourned her death together.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nTogether with the survivors, Lexie's body was taken out of the woods and transported back to Seattle. Cristina once told Owen about the nights in the woods, when she heard animals fighting and growling. She told him that she realized that they were fighting over Lexie's body and that she did her best to try and keep them off of her.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nDay of the Dead\nLexie was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nCovid-  Beach\nLexie appeared on Meredith's beach while she fought for her life. Lexie was joined by [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and together they tried to convince Meredith why she should keep living and not die.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and Lexie talk at Joe's.]]\nLexie came to Seattle for her mother's funeral and after, she went to Joe's. Like her sister, she met her future brother-in-law [[Derek Shepherd]] there and later discovered he worked at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\nVoted student body president, Lexie was popular by both peers and teachers at school. Her photographic memory also made her one of the brightest in her class and not only made her a natural in the OR but also meant she knew all the periodic elements which she tells Mark Sloan when having a drink at Joe's bar.\n\nAs an intern, Lexie was portrayed to be emotionally fragile and incapable of lying or covering up. She coped with her anxiety by rambling incessantly or snacking compulsively. She was liked by the attendings for her knowledge and good instincts, but her residents generally treated her as a scut monkey or their encyclopedia.\n\n\n\nWhen Carolyn Shepherd came to Seattle, she asked Lexie how many sexual partners she had, to which she replied that she had six or seven.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nLexie made her first appearance in Seattle Grace when she introduced herself to George.\n\nLexie learned that George was repeating his intern year and helped him keep the other interns unaware of his failure. She and George developed an unlikely friendship over intern struggles and their strained relationships with Meredith and Callie, respectively. Lexie was shown to have been smitten with George. Mark Sloan noticed this and vowed to be less mean to George if she'd admit her feelings to him. As a result, Mark was slightly more polite to the two of them and George misunderstood, thinking Lexie and Mark were sleeping together. Lexie continued to vie for George's affections.\n\nGeorge finally passed his intern exam and seemed to pay less attention to Lexie. The final straw occurred when he received his new interns and Lexie discovers he hadn't had the decency to even ask to have her assigned to him. She broke down in front of him, calling herself stupid and him a jerk. Lexie chose to forgive George and made a peace offering, keeping her feelings for him quiet.\n\nAs George was retaking his intern year and only Lexie knew, the two bonded and became best friends. Having parties with fellow interns such as [[Graciella Guzman|Graciella]], [[Megan Nowland|Megan]], [[Steve Mostow|Steve]], [[Pierce Halley|Pierce]], [[Claire (Intern)|Claire]], and later [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]]. She also moved in with George but later moved out when she felt lonely. Mark then insisted that Derek take her home.\n\n[[File:TeachMe(AllByMyself).jpg|thumb|left|Lexie undresses and asks Mark to \"teach her\".]]\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhile working with Mark Sloan, she developed an attraction, intensified by Derek's ban on them going out. Mark himself was initially reluctant out of loyalty to Derek, as she was the sister of his best friend's wife and their age gap. One night, Lexie went to his hotel room, stripped and says \"''teach me''\", they began a secret relationship. They grew close very quickly and Mark developed true feelings for her, but Lexie was tired of the secrecy and put their relationship on hold. Eventually, Mark told Derek and they began dating in public. Their relationship hit a small bump when Mark decided he did not want to go to dinner with her and Thatcher because fathers didn't like him, but in the end, he went. Another slightly larger bump happened when he suggested she move in with him into a condo he was considering buying, but she didn't think she was ready because she was so young. The conversation turned intensely awkward when Mark accidentally brought up marriage. Lexie told him that in five years she'd still be a resident, and he replied that there were plenty of residents that were married.\n\nWhen Derek performed a 'rogue surgery' on a patient with a highly complex \"inoperable\" spinal tumor and Lexie wanted to take part, Mark encouraged her with a huge smile and said \"''Go get your rogue on''.\", which hinted that they were in a committed relationship. When Mark's -year-old daughter, [[Sloan Riley]] arrives, she's supportive, even better than he was with dealing with it. But later on, she proves to have some difficulty when his daughter reveals she is pregnant and Mark offers to let her stay as long as she wants in him and Lexie will be there for her, entirely not consulting Lexie on the matter. And her being a grandmother at  is way too much for her to take, after an argument about it later, he asks her not to make him choose between her and Sloan (his daughter) Lexie asks \"''Why because you'll choose her?''\" and Mark responds \"''Yeah''.\" And Lexie says, tearfully, ''\"I think our relationship just ended''.\" Then she goes to Meredith's house and gets drunk, and has a discussion with Alex, leading to her sleeping with him. She later discovers that Mark slept with Addison, and he discovers she slept with Alex. He becomes angry at her for this.\n\nLexie began to date Alex after his divorce with Izzie. She becomes jealous when she finds out Mark slept with Reed. Later Mark tells her he still loves her, to which she replies \"''I have a boyfriend,''\" Mark tells her ''<nowiki>\"'</nowiki>'''I know. '''''I'm just saying you could have a husband.\" When the shooting happened, Mark and Lexie tended to Alex's shot wound. During this, Lexie told Alex she loved him, much to Mark's disappointment. Alex left Lexie after her breakdown, and Mark took Lexie to the psych ward. At Joe's, April tells Lexie that Mark loves her, that's why he always stares at her. Lexie then goes to his apartment, applies her makeup in the elevator, then is crushed to see him making out with Derek's sister, Amelia. Lexie and Mark continue to flirt. One day, he tells her he misses her. Then she asks him to talk to a nurse who hates her, to which he is willing to exchange for one drink. Upon seeing which nurse it is, he makes it two. She tells him \"''Fine''\" That night and tells Jackson to come in during the date telling her he needs her for something as an excuse to leave the date. Lexie arrives at Joe's later, tells him that it isn't fair for either of them since Mark is at a different point in her life than Lexie. Mark responds by simply kissing her, she kisses him back. Jackson arrives to pull her out of her date, and Lexie tells him to go, and she continues to kiss Mark. What Lexie doesn't know, is that Mark had a one night stand with Callie during their breakup, and Callie is now pregnant with his child. When Mark tells Lexie, she looks at him with disbelief and then storms out of his apartment. Mark wants to make things right, but Lexie won't talk to him, so he arranges for Jackson to find out what's bothering Lexie, in exchange for scrubbing in on his surgery. Lexie, with tears in her eyes, spills the beans to Jackson about how Mark has left her behind once again and does not care about how she feels. Jackson decides not to tell Mark because he feels like Lexie told him this in good faith.\n\nShe begins a relationship with Jackson but ends because he realizes she is in love with Mark. Mark was dating a doctor from another hospital, which made Lexie jealous. Lexie tries to tell Mark she still loves him, and after many fails, she does it, but he doesn't respond. When the plane crashes, and Lexie is about to die, Mark asks her to marry him, and says they will have children, after hearing this, Lexie dies.\n\nWhen Mark returns to the hospital, after the plane crash, Julia, his girlfriend was waiting for him, and she says she loves him, but he responds, \"I loved Lexie.\"\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nSince Mark was still in love with Lexie, he recruited Jackson and bribed him with surgery in exchange for information about Lexie. Jackson, however, began to have feelings for Lexie and the two began dating. Lexie told Mark that she was seeing someone else when they were at Callie's baby shower. He asked if it was someone he knew, but Lexie walked away. Eventually, Mark figured it out once the two went public with their relationship. Lexie and Jackson's relationship became complicated as Mark was Jackson's mentor and it became clear to Jackson that Lexie was still in love with Mark. Jackson ended it with Lexie, saying that he, \"chooses Mark\".\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex and Lexie slept together once when she first became an intern at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Then they later had a relationship that lasted until he called out for [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] after being shot and she was committed to the psych ward in the aftermath of the shooting.\n\n\n[[Thatcher Grey]]\nThatcher was a good father to Lexie, contrary to how he was with Meredith. As Meredith said, Lexie \"never saw his bad side.\" Even as Lexie discovered the way Thatcher treated Meredith, she still loved him. She protected Thatcher's reputation during his alcoholism following [[Susan Grey|Susan's]] death. Each time he visited [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], she was warm to him. She was annoyed when he began dating again. However, Meredith eventually told Lexie it wasn't worth being angry over.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith took an instant dislike to her half-sister, Lexie, upon her arrival. Meredith truly hated the enthusiasm Lexie showed trying to get to know her. Meredith, however, quickly realized that although she had reason to hate the idea of her, she had no reason to hate Lexie herself.\n\nInitially, she didn't like the way Lexie followed her or spoke to Derek about her. She claimed that Lexie was someone she never wanted to know, even trying to deny that Lexie was her sister. After a traumatic day, Cristina brought Lexie to Meredith's with her and Meredith made an effort to bond with her and they danced and drank tequila. The next morning, Meredith even tried to make breakfast for her, and Lexie was so enthusiastic that she ate it, despite knowing she would have an allergic reaction to the eggs.\n\nLexie and Meredith didn't get too close, as Meredith was over a surgical year older and they had two different sets of friends. As [[George O'Malley|George]] and Lexie's friendship phased out, Lexie gave up the apartment that the two of them had shared. She moved into the attic of Meredith's house, where she occasionally bemoaned the fact that she didn\ut have a proper room instead.\n\nOnce George died and Izzie left the hospital, the remaining residents became very close. Meredith and Lexie became so close that Meredith gave Thatcher a piece of her liver so that Lexie wouldn't lose her dad because Lexie wasn't a match.\n\nShe also sat with Lexie for  hours after she had a PTSD breakdown following the shooting and had to be committed to the psychiatric ward. After Meredith's miscarriage, Lexie got jealous over how April was close with Meredith. Lexie was ashamed over her jealousy, but Meredith was flattered and told her, \"You're not crazy, Lexie. You're a Grey.\"\n\nWhen the plane crashed, Lexie died as a result of the injuries she sustained and upon hearing this, Meredith cried hysterically.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref> While treating a patient who had similar injuries, Meredith obsessed over saving the patient's life. After successfully saving the woman, Meredith was talking to Cristina and simply said that \"Lexie's dead\". From this, it appears that Meredith has accepted the fact that Lexie is gone and is at peace.<ref>[[Beautiful Doom]], x</ref>\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nDerek and Lexie's bond actually began romantically. Right after the funeral for her mother and before Lexie began her internship at Seattle Grace, she actually asked Derek if she could buy him a drink. She, of course, did not know he was Meredith's at the time boyfriend.<ref>[[Testing --]], x</ref> This did not cause any roadblocks because as soon as Lexie realized who Derek was, she backed right off.  \n\nUnlike Meredith, Derek accepted Lexie as a sister from the beginning and repeatedly tried to persuade Meredith to be nice to her. Lexie saw him as a big brother and would seek his advice, often at the most inappropriate times. He also comforted and encouraged her after they were forced to send home a terminally ill young boy after discovering in surgery that his cancer was too advanced for them to help.<ref>[[Hope for the Hopeless]], x</ref>\n\n[[Zola Grey Shepherd]]\nZola is Lexie's niece. She babysat Zola while Meredith and Derek went out on [[All You Need is Love|Valentine's Day]] and presumably other various times. Lexie also referred to Zola as her \"favorite little niece\". Before she died, Meredith and Derek's will stated that Lexie would become Zola's legal guardian if her parents died.\n\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\nLexie developed a short friendship with [[Sadie Harris]] when she covered for Lexie, saying that she (Sadie) gave Mark Sloan a penile fracture, even though it was actually Lexie. She later guarded the door so Lexie could visit Mark in his room.\n\n\n[[File:Lexiewins.jpg|thumb|right|px|Lexie wins the intern competition.]]\nLexie graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]]. She aced her [[Psychiatry|psych]] [[Clerkship|clerkship]].\n\nShe was accepted into Seattle Grace's [[General Surgery|Surgical]] [[Resident|Residency Program]], choosing Seattle Grace over [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She was assigned to surgical resident [[Cristina Yang]]. Lexie was considered the best of the interns and she even won the intern competition set up by Izzie.\n\nIn her fourth (and subsequently final) year of residency, Lexie took an interest in [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgery]] and often rotated on Derek's service, tackling several cases that were deemed inoperable by other neurosurgeons.\n\n\n*She was allergic to eggs, but loved avocados.<ref>[[Lay Your Hands on Me]], x</ref>\n*She hated apples and thought they shouldn't be allowed to be fruits, but she liked apple juice.<ref>[[Physical Attraction...

She spent four months waiting for a heart transplant before one came through. The transplant was successful and Ivy began to recover. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-op, Ivy's indices were good and she was recovering well. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLater, Ivy spiked a fever. Cristina took her to the OR for a biopsy, which revealed that she was rejecting her donor heart. They treated it with anti-rejection medication and put Ivy back on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nIvy was later discharged to recover at home. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Ivy was in surgery getting her new heart, Jon brought their second child, Frankie, into the ER because she was coughing up pink fluid. She, too, was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. The doctors inserted a pacemaker. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks after her pacemaker was inserted, Frankie was doing well, even walking around the hospital. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nWhile playing Hide and Seek with [[Braden Morris]], Frankie collapsed in a hallway. When she was found, her pulse was weak and she wasn't breathing well. She was taken into surgery to insert an LVAD and then she was put on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nFrankie's LVAD failed to reverse the heart damage, which left her in desperate need of a heart. One became available, but when they transplanted it, they discovered that it had been damaged during retrieval and couldn't keep her alive. When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting in Frankie\us room while the doctors talked to his parents, Link started to cough up pink fluid just as Frankie had. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nLink was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and declined quickly. They attempted to put him on a Berlin Heart, but he was clotting too much. They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLink's heart pump worked well, keeping him stable as he waited for a heart transplant. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nLink was later discharged and allowed to wait for a heart transplant at home. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\nA heart became available for Link during the aftermath of the explosion at the Mall of the Woods. Despite this, they had Link come in to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for his transplant. The transplant was successful. ''(\"[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Link's heart transplant, [[Maggie Pierce]], who was looking into genetic causes of cardiomyopathy for another patient, discovered what had caused the McNeil kids' cardiomyopathy. A mutation called RAF  had been discovered to cause cardiomyopathy only a week before and all three McNeil children had that mutation. Sabine was relieved that it wasn't something in their house or something she had done. ''(\"[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Sabine McNeil]]\nJon is married to Sabine McNeil, with whom he has three kids. When the stress of their three kids being in the hospital started to get to them, they fought, Jon walked out, and Sabine wondered if it would destroy their marriage. However, Jon came back, saying that he had fallen asleep in the car and his phone had died. He apologized and they made up.\n\n\nJon has three children, all of whom had been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. His middle child, Frankie, ultimately died of her condition, while Ivy and Link received heart transplants.\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nBoth Sabine and Jon grew to know and trust Cristina Yang while their children were hospitalized.

They did a CT and during the CT, she crashed and they were forced to do a pericardiocentesis in the CT booth to relieve the cardiac tamponade. They sent the fluid to the lab for testing, but had to admit they didn't know what was going on with her.

Later, she joined him at the bar and offered him a pen. He informed her that the pen was advertising an erectile dysfunction drug, explaining why none of the men wanted to take them. She hadn't known because she was an artist who only took the job for money. He invited her for a drink and took the rest of her pens from her so she'd agree.

While waiting for the results, they continued to butt heads as he commented on her using residents for personal errands and then recognized her name as the surgeon who got herself fired. The CT then showed a mass in Jamie's back between two ribs. Meredith believed it was a gallstone that had escaped during a previous surgery, but Cormac thought it might be a malignant mass. Meredith didn't want to mention a possible malignancy to Jamie and her mother, but Cormac insisted on telling them and went behind her back. Jamie and her mother were extremely worried so Meredith stepped in to ease their concerns. They did a biopsy, which showed that the mass was not malignant. Meredith decided to remove the mass to see what it was. Cormac tried to object, but Meredith said it was her house and he was just a guest. The mass turned out to be exactly what Meredith predicted, impressing Cormac. Meredith later witnessed how he comforted Jamie, who feared her crush was ignoring her, that he could tell from his experience of having two teenage boys that the lack of a reply was just a teenage boy being scared of talking to a girl he liked. Later, Cormac ended up in an elevator with Meredith, who asked if unnecessarily scaring patients and their family and then basking in their relief afterward was his thing. He told her that unlike his late wife's doctors, he preferred to give people all the available information. He then told her that while he understood it was her house, someone had given him a key, so they needed to learn to live together. After he left, Meredith got a text from Cristina\uasaying that Cormac was the package she had sent.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nCormac met [[Jo Wilson|Jo Karev]] when she brought in the -day-old baby boy who had been surrendered at Station . As he examined the boy, Cormac inquired if the hospital had a baby hatch like his hospital in Switzerland. Jo then realized Cormac was the guy Meredith had came to vent about, though she masked it as having heard about the \"new guy.\" Cormac then told her he had heard good things about her husband, his predecessor. When he was done examining the baby, Cormac said they could bring in social services. He then noticed Jo had grown fond of the baby and said they could wait a few minutes. Jo asked if Cormac had kids. He told her about his two teenagers. Cormac held the baby and told Jo he had missed the perfect stage of his boys growing up because of residency. Cormac joked he would have stolen this perfect baby, unaware that Jo had taken the baby home for several hours before bringing him to the hospital. He told Jo of his own sons, saying he believed he missed their best stage because he was a resident when his sons were babies. Later, he had a brief friendly chat with Meredith about them having been called in early.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, Cormac entered the attendings' lounge as Meredith was trying to get more information on him from Cristina, who refused to budge. Cormac then introduced himself to a pregnant [[Amelia Shepherd]] and tied her shoe for her as she struggled to do so. He then poured himself some coffee, which he commented was very good. He offered Meredith a cup but she declined. Amelia, in awe of his looks and good manners, informed him that it was better from the cart outside. On their way to the ER, Meredith finally addressed the elephant in the room and brought up Cristina but Cormac was confused as to who she was talking about. Their shared patient, Kai Hale, started throwing up blood. As they waited for the CT results, Cormac told Meredith about his boys and their teenage stupidity. He then apologized to Meredith for their tense first encounter and explained he got a little dark that time of year because it's when he had lost his wife to cancer two years prior. Meredith agreed to start over. She revealed her own spouse had died. She knew the two-year anniversary was a tough one and assured him it gets better over time. Based on Kai's CT, Cormac heavily suspected that their patient had been vaping, which his friends confirmed. He showed them a comparison of Kai's lungs versus healthy lungs to scare them into stopping vaping. Cormac wanted to remove part of his lung to stop the bleeding but Meredith suggested they use coiling instead. Cormac agreed to her approach and watched her every move. He revealed he had seen cases like this before, in which there was often a re-bleed. Moments later, the re-bleed happened so they converted to an open procedure. During the procedure, he said that last time, he was on the opposite side of the debate and the other doctor was Dr. Yang. Cormac informed Kai's father on his tough recovery. He then told Meredith he wouldn't rub it in that he was right, unlike Cristina, who teased him about it for months. Meredith then let it slip that she knew Cristina, though walked off when Cormac asked her about it.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nCormac brought his sons to the hospital on a day when there was no school due to parent-teacher conferences. During this time he introduced them to Meredith. They were reluctant to be shown around and when the time came for them to go to their conference, he had trouble finding them and asked Meredith if she had seen them. He contemplated whether he hated his sons from time to time. He said he didn't know how she stayed sane while combining her job with raising her kids. She said she dropped a ball from time to time, like the time her daughter had to tell her the water had been turned off because she had forgotten to pay the water bill.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Joey Phillips]] resisted doing his physical therapy, Cormac challenged [[Levi Schmitt]] to find a way to make it feel less daunting. Cormac himself came up with the idea of letting him play video games. He asked Nurse Karen to find the video game cart and Meredith commented on his idea and informed him she was putting together a pro bono surgery day. As she began to inform Cormac about the video game room, Andrew interrupted her to ask her about a previous case of hers. Cormac pointed out he was being rude. In Italian, Andrew told him to give them a minute. Surprisingly, Cormac told him in Italian to learn some respect. Cormac told Meredith to put him down for her pro bono day and took off to track down the game room. Still, Joey refused to play video games while he had no idea if his foster siblings were okay. Cormac tracked down [[Miranda Bailey]], who had been worrying about Joey's future, and asked if she knew someone they could call to find out about his siblings. She managed to find his siblings and together with Cormac, she escorted them to Joey's room. Joey agreed to play the video games with his siblings. Afterward, Cormac overheard Andrew yelling at Meredith for being a hypocrite for scolding him for not following the rules. Cormac told him to calm down but Andrew yelled back to mind his own business. Meredith told Cormac they were fine and then pointed out that Andrew was sounding like his father. Andrew then told her they were done. Cormac suggested Meredith write him up for his outburst but she brushed it off.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\n\nDuring a blizzard, Cormac became enraged when a liver became available for his patient, [[Elisa Tang]], but couldn't be transported to the hospital due to the weather. He was grateful when Andrew offered to go on foot to retrieve the liver. While Andrew was gone, Cormac continued to monitor Elisa. When she started hemorrhaging, he and Meredith took Elisa into surgery to place a shunt to stop her bleeding. While they were in surgery, Cormac took the time to get to know Meredith and the two of them bonded over being widowed. When the liver arrived, they transplanted it into Elisa, who immediately started to improve. After her surgery was done, Cormac and Meredith told her parents she'd be okay. That evening, as he left the hospital, Cormac ran into Meredith and told her it was nice to talk to someone who understood what it was like to lose a spouse so young and that it helped to have a friend. Meredith said that it helped her too.\uaHe then confessed that Cristina did talk about having a twisted sister and asked Meredith if that was her. Meredith shrugged and smiled knowingly in response.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\n\nCormac offered his services during the pro bono surgery day Meredith had planned. He made a joke about pro bono surgery day being every day in Ireland, which Meredith didn't appreciate. At the end of the day, Cormac came to see her and brought her tea. He congratulated her for pulling off the pro bono surgery day, but she was not as impressed with herself. In response he said he could now see the twistedness in her that Cristina Yang had talked about. She told him it took him long enough and thanked him for his help.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]] x</ref>\n\n\nCormac went to the Surgical Innovation Conference in Los Angeles upon Bailey's request. He was uncomfortable at the conference, as it reminded him of the time when he first met this wife Abigail at the same conference at the same hotel many years prior.\uaWhen sales rep\ua[[Dane Pinetti]] tried to pitch Cormac and [[Teddy Altman]] on the possibility of his company partnering with Grey Sloan, Cormac revealed that he already knew how one of their most popular devices, the C- power morcellator, worked because\uait had killed his wife by spreading an isolated cancerous tumor throughout her body. Cormac revealed the company knows that it's a problem but\uais paying to suppress the proof that it kills people. He refused to hear anything more from Dane, told him in no uncertain terms to leave, and passed on the drink.\uaDane left\uaand Cormac apologized\uato Teddy for his outburst.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nCormac worked on the case of [[Daya Burman]], who was at the hospital for a bilateral gracilis transfer to treat Moebius syndrome. During the surgery, he was surprised to find that other people at the hospital had knowledge of his dating life when Jo asked him if he used any dating apps. He told her he didn\ut and she replied that he didn\ut need to seeing as he has his own personal matchmaker referring to Cristina. He asked her what that was supposed to mean and in response she changed the subject.\uaAfter the surgery, he told Jo he hated set-ups and tried to ask her more about it, but she refused to give him a straight answer. He then decided to ask Meredith to get a drink. She accepted, but said she was too exhausted to do it then and told him to ask her again another time. He told her he would and bid her goodnight.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle, Cormac worked alongside the other doctors and nurses at Grey Sloan to treat patients. His sister-in-law, [[Irene Davis]], insisted on moving to Seattle to take care of his boys at home so he could focus on his work at the hospital.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref> One day, he paged Meredith to assist him in operating on [[Frankie Morris]], who had had a kidney transplant two months prior. Frankie was readmitted because his abdomen was impaled by a tree branch. At the end of his shift, Cormac texted Meredith and invited her for a drink, saying that he had another bottle of whiskey in his office. Unfortunately, Meredith didn't see the text because she was asleep at the time. Having not received a response, Cormac headed home for the night only to discover Meredith passed out in the parking lot on the way to her car. Cormac tried to rouse her and when that was unsuccessful, he called for other staff members to help him.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nAfter [[Val Ashton]] was admitted and discovered to have an abdominal pregnancy Cormac worked with [[Carina DeLuca]] on baby [[Luna Ashton]], who was born prematurely. Because the baby wasn't moving, Cormac and Carina intubated Luna, transferred her to an incubator, and then transported her to the NICU. Following the procedure, Cormac came to visit Meredith. He had previously asked [[Maggie Pierce]] about her condition and had heard that she was looking for a new Power of Attorney (POA). Due to the new COVID- protocols, Cormac had to video call her from outside her window in full personal protective equipment. He joked that she looked like crap and told her about the Luna Ashton case. They discussed her search for a new POA and Meredith admitted she was having a hard time choosing someone because everyone around the hospital was family. Cormac advised her to write down what she wanted and then choose someone who would choose her over and over again and would defend her choices. She asked if that was what Cormac did for his wife. He told her no and that he knew better than that and that his wife's sister was her POA. Cormac then told Meredith to get some sleep and in response, Meredith confided in him that she was afraid that if she fell asleep she might not wake up. Cormac then gave her a pep talk by telling her that everyone was scared of her because of how fierce she is and because she's got grit and fights to the death about the stupidest little things and that the virus had nothing on her. Meredith then ended the call and went to sleep.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the firefighters from Station  brought in two kidnapping victims who were injured in a house fire, Cormac worked with Levi and [[Jackson Avery]] to treat the two girls, [[Shanice]] and [[Jada Williams]], for smoke inhalation and, in Jada's case, second-degree burns on her left hand. Whilst Cormac was checking up on Jada, her mother [[Joyce Williams]], who had been arrested at the scene, showed up and was reunited with her daughter. Outside the room, Cormac asked Jackson if that was his doing. Jackson had had his attorney look into the case and subsequently used his own money to get Joyce out of jail.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nA few weeks after their hospitalization, both Val and Luna's condition worsened. Cormac diagnosed Luna with a bronchogenic cyst, which required surgery. He informed Jo so she could inform Val but Jo was reluctant to do so because of Val's worsening condition and low spirits. Cormac joined Jo to explain the situation. Val asked to see her daughter before her own surgery. Jo agreed to her request despite Cormac's objections. He said it was against protocol and posed an unnecessary risk for Luna. His opinion caused tension with Jo, who wondered if he was nicer before his wife died. Cormac reminded her that Meredith was laughing and joking a few hours before being put on a ventilator and that the rules exist to keep people safe. Jo then wondered if he would stick to the rules if it were Meredith who wanted to see her kids. Cormac then budged and agreed to a few minutes. However, Val coded as they were moving Luna. While Jo ran the code on Val, Cormac took Luna into surgery. Once back in the NICU with Luna, Jo informed him that Val had died. Cormac then admitted that he was indeed nicer before his wife died and that he was better in a lot of ways. He acknowledged that what Jo wanted to do was kind.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref> Cormac continued to treat Luna in the NICU over the following weeks and both Jo and Bailey came to visit her frequently.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the unexpected death of Andrew DeLuca, Cormac volunteered to help treat COVID patients since they were short-staffed. He helped Teddy out with Meredith's case. He sat by her bedside and told her to pull through as the hospital couldn't take another loss. Since her recent COVID test had come back negative and her status was improving, they decided to try weaning her off the ventilator. He offered to handle it with the respiratory therapist so Teddy could take  a break, but she declined. They lightened Meredith's sedation and lowered the ventilator settings but it soon became clear that it was too soon. They turned the settings back up and agreed to try again in a few days. Cormac helped set up a video call with Amelia and [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]]. He then informed [[Richard Webber]] that weaning Meredith off the vent hadn't worked as hoped. He commented that when his wife died his therapist told him that there was no wrong way to process the loss, but now he knew that doing it over a computer screen was in fact a wrong way. He later went back into Meredith's room and talked to her about her kids in an attempt to encourage her to fight. He described their daily video calls in vivid detail. Having heard stories of previous fights she had won, he believed Meredith had it in her to get better like other patients. In the evening, he set up a tablet in Meredith's room to watch the memorial for Andrew by her side, even though she was still unconscious.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\n\nOne day, Cormac received a call from his boys that their aunt Irene had been taken to the hospital by an ambulance. Upset that Irene hadn't informed him herself, he rushed to the ER and found Jo taking Irene's history. Cormac kept interrupting her to stress that Irene was living with multiple sclerosis and used strong teas from her acupuncturist as pain relief, since she had came to distrust Western medicine after her sister's death. As Jo suspected, a CT confirmed that her pain was caused by a kidney stone. Deeply appreciative of Irene despite their differences and not wanting to risk losing another family member, he insisted on the getting the best for her and paged [[Catherine Fox]] when it was determined that Irene would need surgery. Catherine came to see Irene and explained the lithotripsy procedure and the routine nature of it. Cormac took Irene up to the OR himself and tried giving her a little tour on the way, though he admitted there wasn't much to see in a pandemic. Irene was more interested in meeting this general surgeon that made him smile whom her nephews had told her about. Cormac admitted she was on a vent in the ICU. Irene was disappointed she wouldn't get to meet her and that he had fallen for another sick woman. He promised to check in after the procedure, but Jo came out halfway through to inform him that the ureter had detached from the kidney as they pulled out the scope. Cormac began to spiral, saying his boys couldn't lose the one person who had become everything to them in this pandemic. Jo pointed out it was just a complication so he told her to go back and fix it. The repair was successful. As promised, Cormac checked in on Irene with Jo. Cormac thanked Jo. Once she was gone, Irene wondered if Jo was single. Cormac didn't know. Together, they checked in on the boys.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\nCormac worked on the case of [[Arthur Beaton]], a toddler with multiple cardiac problems who was awaiting a transplant. After a heart-to-heart with Arthur's distraught father, Cormac went to Maggie and suggested a double-pump EXCOR to stabilize Arthur, but Maggie shut the idea down as Arthur's chest cavity was too small. Cormac felt that Maggie was giving up too easily and challenged her to find a solution, but Maggie pointed out it was time for a difficult conversation with Arthur's parents about taking him off life support. Before doing so, Cormac went to see Luna in the NICU. Jo showed up as well and as they watched the baby girl, Jo said she hoped Luna wouldn't grow up to resent the hand she had been dealt. Jo opened up and shared that she had spent too much time being angry about the way she had come into the world. That was until she let go of that anger, which felt like breaking off the black, crusty pieces of her heart. Her comment inspired Cormac, who paged Maggie to tell her they could remove Arthur's ventricles to make room in his chest for the EXCOR artificial heart. Arthur's father was reluctant but consented after Cormac explained they had no other options but give up. The surgery was a success and Arthur was stable in the PICU afterward.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing the murder of George Floyd on May ,  a Black Lives Matter Protest was organized in Seattle. Cormac attended with his sons, who made protest signs. While at the protest, he sustained a head injury when he interfered when a neo-nazi counter-protester went after one of his sons with a billy club. Cormac then drove himself and the boys to the hospital. They ran into Jackson in the parking lot and asked him for help. While Cormac had his head stitched up, he called Irene to have her pick up the boys. He informed Jackson he wouldn't allow his boys to protest anymore until they were . He decided to stay at work since the ER was filling up with other casualties from the protests. He assisted Richard and Jackson with their initial work-up of [[Nell Timms]], who was shot with a teargas canister at close range at the protest. Later, he ran into Jo in the ER who fixed his band-aid for him. When he started coughing as they were talking, he assured her it was due to the teargas at the protest. He brought up that his boys complained about having to go home rather than back to the protest. Jo understood both sides but Cormac said he had lost too many people to see any side but his own. In the evening, Cormac joined Jackson and Richard as they checked up on Nell, who recounted protest stories from years past. Having gained a better understanding of their importance, Cormac drove home to admit to his boys that he was wrong to forbid them from protesting. He acknowledged they were experiencing an important moment so he had decided they would be allowed to go to protests but only during daylight and with him by their side. They agreed to go to another protest the next day, after which they played soccer together.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\n\nSome time later, Cormac discharged Nurse [[Jennilynn Mandap]] to great fanfare. She was the hospital's tenth COVID discharge that week and many people's favorite ICU Nurse. When [[Winston Ndugu]] had the idea to sneak Zola into Meredith's hospital room in the hope that it would encourage her to wake up, Richard asked Cormac for child-sized PPE that they could use. Cormac obliged, not knowing it was for Zola until Maggie brought her to the hospital. Richard thanked him and told him that he wouldn't tell anyone that he helped. Cormac told him it was fine with him if he did.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref> Winston's idea worked and Meredith woke up and started improving which resulted in her being cleared for discharge some time later. Cormac gathered with the other doctors and hospital workers to clap her out in the ambulance bay. However, Meredith did not appear as planned and resident [[Zander Perez]] informed everyone that she was not in her room and that her stuff was gone. Cormac laughed loudly and commended Meredith for pulling one over on everyone. He then wished everyone a good evening and went back inside.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref>\n\nA few weeks later Luna\us condition worsened, and she began spitting up after every meal because she lacked a gag reflex from having been intubated for so long. During this time, Cormac met [[Carmen Delgado]] from Child Services who had been assigned as Luna\us legal guardian. Carmen asked that Cormac keep her updated on Luna\us case. The following week Luna\us condition improved somewhat, but she was still suffering from mild reflux. Over time Jo became increasingly attached to Luna and was offended that Carmen barely had any time for Luna. Cormac pointed out that Carmen was a social worker and not her parent. Two weeks later Luna coded, and Cormac had to intubate her. He asked Jo to help him, but she panicked and was unable to do so. After he got Luna\us rhythm normalized Jo told him she wanted to be Luna\us mom. A week later, Luna\us x-rays showed she had aspiration pneumonia which Cormac treated using antibiotics. During this time Jo sat with Luna often and stayed with her throughout the night. In recognition of this Cormac held off on calling Carmen to give Jo more time alone with Luna. He joked that a parent or legal guardian of one of his patients is mad at him at least once a day and that Jo was no different. Jo told him she hoped that Luna would live long enough for her paperwork to go through so that she could adopt her. A week later, Luna was still aspirating, and Cormac wanted to perform a Nissen fundoplication to help stop the reflux. Jo was in favour of the procedure, but Carmen disagreed having taken care of children who had had the procedure before. Carmen told Jo she was sorry that her adoption application was denied as it was a nice idea. After Carmen left Jo told Cormac that her application was denied because she failed her background check.<ref>[[I'm Still Standing]], x</ref>\n\nIn August of , Carmen finally approved Luna's surgery and Cormac operated on her. The surgery was successful and he discussed her case with Meredith who had just returned to work as Directory of Residency. They joked about the events of the past few months and he told her he was confident that her name would be back on the OR board soon. Meredith wasn't so sure. The following month, Luna was eating well and Carmen informed Cormac and Jo that she had found a family that was willing to foster Luna in order to adopt her and that the family had requested a timeline. Cormac told her it was too early to tell and Carmen asked him to keep her updated. On Christmas Eve, Cormac met Meredith in the attendings' lounge and saw that she was upset. He told her the holidays were hard for him as it's when he misses Abigail the most. Meredith changed the subject and said she had hoped that patients who had recovered from COVID would be eligible for lung transplants and Cormac agreed it would be great if they were. He then presented Meredith with her Christmas present which was a opened half-empty bottle of whiskey. He told it was short notice and joked about her passing out to avoid having a drink with him. Meredith poured them both drinks and they finally had their drink together. In April of  Cormac finally discharged Luna from the hospital and Jo took her home as she was now her legal guardian. That same day Cormac attended Maggie and Winston's second wedding. As the couple were exchanging their vows he shared a look with Meredith who wound up having to leave after the ceremony with Teddy to perform a lung transplant on their patient. Cormac stayed for Maggie and Winston's reception and danced with the other guests. Following the reception, Cormac joined his colleagues at the hospital to do a clap out for Meredith after she successfully completed her first surgery post-COVID.<ref>[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n\nHe is a humorous man and has been shown to be good with kids and teenagers alike. He used to be kinder before his wife's death while he now has a rather rough edge to him. He can be pretty opinionated and stubborn but is willing to listen to reason and is not afraid to admit when he's made a mistake.\n\n\n\n[[Abigail Hayes]]\nHe was married until his wife, [[Abigail Hayes]], died. He says that before she died, the doctors weren't transparent with him, which is why he tells families everything he knows. It is clear he loved Abigail very dearly because he developed a deep hatred for Wilkes and Boon, the company that created a medical device that resulted in her uterine cancer spreading throughout her body and ultimately killing her, to the point he threatened to kill a sales representative from that company when they wanted to partner with Grey Sloan.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nUpon moving to Seattle\uahe began developing a relationship with Meredith Grey. At first, their relationship was a rocky one as they butted heads over the case of Jamie Caldwell. However, following that, they worked together on the case of Kai Hale during which\uaCormac apologized for his previous behavior and the two became friends. Eventually, Cormac asked Meredith out and she accepted. However, before they could go out on a date, the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle and so they took to having drinks in his office instead, all of which was put on hold when Meredith contracted COVID- and had to be admitted. After she recovered, they celebrated by sharing a bottle of whiskey in the attending's lounge on Christmas Eve.  \n\n\nHe has two sons, Liam and Austin, who are both teenagers. He cares very much about his sons, and they have a close relationship and tease each other often. His father-in-law used to make him watch American football, which he never understood.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref> While some personal disagreements (i.e. regarding Western medicine) exist between them, he maintains a close relationship with his former sister-in-law, [[Irene Davis]]. She insisted on moving to Seattle when the COVID- pandemic hit so she could look after her nephews.\n\n\nHe knows and worked with [[Cristina Yang]]. She is responsible for him coming to work at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He described her as being a nightmare to work with and that when they disagreed about a surgery and she turned out to be right she drove him mad and rubbed it in his face.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref> However, she clearly likes and respects him otherwise she wouldn't have sent him as a gift for Meredith. \n\nSince moving to Seattle, he has worked well with [[Jo Wilson]], even though they can disagree sometimes.\n\n\nHe is the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Pediatric Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].

On her first day, she argued with Izzie after taking\ua[[George O'Malley|George's]] cubby, which they had been leaving empty. She also butted heads with Alex when they fought over who would be treating [[Michael Goldman]]. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nAfter a fire at a local hotel, several people were brought to the ER with burns. Reed examined [[Danny Becker]] and proclaimed that he was perfectly fine. She then moved on to work on [[Roy Mackinaw]], a firefighter who was injured during the rescue efforts. All the doctors who worked in the ER that night were interviewed when [[Cathy Becker]] died under suspicious circumstances. She ultimately solved the mystery of Cathy's death, which resulted in [[April Kepner]] being fired.

''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nWhile working on [[Tom Kates]], Reed flirted with Alex, implying that she'd trade sexual favors for the chance to scrub in. He later confronted her about it, saying that if she wanted sex, she should just ask for sex and she should suck up to attendings for surgery. ''(\"[[Blink]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Derek Shepherd]] became Chief after [[Richard Webber]] was ousted, the Mercy West residents were all worried that he'd fire them because he hated the merger. They also gossiped about why Richard had been ousted. ''(\"[[State of Love and Trust]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were forced to attend sensitivity training, led by [[Miranda Bailey]]. She taught \"Reaction, Observation, Communication\" to improve their interactions with patients whose cases needed more sensitivity. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:xReedAdamsonDead.jpg|thumb|left|Reed Adamson's tragic death.]]\nWhile looking for supplies for a patient, Gary Clark asked her where Derek's office was. She said she was a surgeon, not a tour guide and needed to attend to a patient having seizures. He immediately shot her in the head, killing her instantly. Her body was discovered by [[April Kepner]], who slipped in her blood as she passed. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\n\nReed was abrasive to those she didn't like or didn't know well, particularly the competing residents from [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] upon the merger. However, she lightened up as time went on.\n\n\n\nAccording to Charles, she dates a lot of men. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nUpon arriving at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]], she had an interest in Alex Karev, stating there was something special about him during a conversation with [[Jackson Avery]]. She flirted with him for a while and comforted him during his divorce with [[Izzie Stevens]], but he showed no real interest in her.\ua''(\"[[Invest in Love]]\")''\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nShe moved on and had a one night stand with\uaMark\uaafter a party at [[Derek Shepherd|Derek Shepherd's]] home while he was also seeing\ua[[Teddy Altman]], but Mark and Teddy weren't exclusive at the time. Teddy actually walked in on them shortly after they had had sex. ''(\"[[Shiny Happy People]]\")''\n\n\n[[Charles Percy]]\nCharles was shown to have a large crush on her. She, in return, was the only person to call him Charlie. When they were interviewed for a documentary, she told the interviewer that Charlie was like a little brother to her and they'd known each other since medical school. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nShe and April were best friends and roommates until Reed's death. While defending her to [[Cristina Yang]], she even said that April was a better doctor than she was.\n\n\nPrior to the merger, she worked at [[Mercy West Medical Center]], but came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] following the merger. She was supposed to finish her residency there, but this was cut short when she was murdered by [[Gary Clark]].\n\n\n*When she and April were roommates, they created a chore wheel together.<ref>[[Can't Fight Biology]], x</ref>\n*She was the only doctor to refer to [[Charles Percy]] as \"Charlie\".<ref>[[Invasion]], x</ref>\n*Reed used the same cubby as [[George O'Malley]], much to the dismay of [[Izzie Stevens]].<ref>[[Invasion]], x</ref>\n*Reed sometimes did yoga to relax after long surgeries.<ref>[[Give Peace a Chance]], x</ref>\n*Her last words were \"Look, you're not even supposed to be back here.

She did and then called for a cardio consult.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]] listened to his heart and heard atrial fibrillation and prescribed blood thinners and an outpatient workup because he wasn't symptomatic. However, he later had a cardiac episode. He had a ventricular septal defect.

She went to Tyler, who informed her that she needed to wake Bailey to help her do it.\n\nLater, when [[Katie Bryce]] was having a seizure and Meredith showed up, he told Meredith she needed to calm down and decide what to do next. ''(\"[[A Hard Day's Night]]\")''\n\n\nTyler was among the group that responded when Cristina called a code for Liz Fallon. He took her chart and saw that she was DNR and demanded that Cristina stop resuscitation. ''(\"[[No Man's Land]]\")''\n\n\nTyler was the nurse assigned to Mrs. Patterson. When Mrs. Patterson needed a second surgery, he was sent to call for the OR. ''(\"[[Shake Your Groove Thing]]\")''\n\n\nHe was part of the team that responded when Jimmy Harper coded. He helped get Izzie prepped to crack Mr. Harper's chest. ''(\"[[If Tomorrow Never Comes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina was hospitalized, Tyler caught her looking through patient charts. He read her own chart, which said she was supposed to be on bed rest and could only get out of bed to move to a chair. ''(\"[[Deny, Deny, Deny]]\")''\n\n\nEllis was among his patients. She escaped twice while George was supposed to be watching her, which amused Tyler. ''(\"[[Deny, Deny, Deny]]\")''\n\n\nTyler signed the get-well card for Joe when he was hospitalized due to his aneurysm. Tyler wrote that the first time he'd ever stepped foot in the hospital was to force Burke and Derek to perform surgery together and that he was always the one to rock the boat. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the train crash, Tyler came into the hospital and delivered the message to Meredith from Joe that Derek had come to the bar after she'd left, but he mistakenly called Derek \"McSteamy.\" ''(\"[[Into You Like a Train]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina upset [[Debbie]], Tyler helped her get her revenge by paging Cristina for every gross case all day. ''(\"[[Something to Talk About]]\")''\n\n\nTyler was one of the nurses who went on strike to protest mandatory overtime. He, along with Olivia and Debbie, asked George to go inside to check on their patients. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Mindy Carlson came in covered in blood, Tyler was shocked that none of the blood was hers. He helped get her cleaned up and then gave her medication to calm her down. ''(\"[[It's the End of the World]]\")''\n\n\nCristina asked Tyler to guard Burke's hospital door so she could strip for him. However, when his parents interrupted, she confronted him. He said he had to respond to a code blue. They saved the guy's life and he used the $ she had paid him to buy everyone coffee to celebrate. ''(\"[[I Am a Tree]]\")''\n\n\nTyler informed George when his patient, Dana Seabury, was caught shoplifting chocolate from the hospital gift shop. ''(\"[[I Am a Tree]]\")''\n\n\nTyler was informed that Addison needed B+ blood in her OR for Noelle Lavatte, so he went to get it immediately. ''(\"[[Let the Angels Commit]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Eric Sanborn was hospitalized, Tyler was one of his nurses. He informed Cristina when Eric started vomiting up blood. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Burke was in the hospital, Cristina used Tyler to pass messages to him because they weren't speaking to each other. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nHiggins was a patient of Tyler's who needed diet orders, which Cristina provided. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Ellis Grey coded, Tyler helped Derek attempt to resuscitate her. He also informed Derek that Burke was doing cardiopulmonary bypass on Meredith. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Jane Burke]] came back to town to collect her son's belongings, Tyler hid Cristina in exchange for a waffle maker that he wanted that she'd gotten as a wedding gift. ''(\"[[Love/Addiction]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Charlie Yost]] was determined that he was going to die that day, he tried pulling off his monitor leads. Tyler wrestled with him over them and told him he could pull off his leads all he wanted and he wouldn't die from it. When Charlie coded shortly afterward, Tyler helped Izzie run the code and resuscitate him. He later informed Izzie that Charlie was checking out AMA. ''(\"[[Let the Truth Sting]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Nick's carotid blew, Tyler is one of the nurses who responded to the code. He held start a transfusion and after Nick died, he informed Lexie that his parents had gotten on a plane from California. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Kyra Marshall was in isolation prior to a heart transplant, Tyler checked the doctors for fevers before working on her case. When Alex temped at .\ub, he was not allowed on the case. ''(\"[[The Becoming]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[William Dunn]] was coding after bashing his head into his hospital bed, Tyler came to inform Meredith. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie had cancer, Tyler came in to check on her. She asked him if he knew where Meredith was. He didn't, but offered to page her. However, Izzie declined. ''(\"[[Sweet Surrender]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the hotel fire, Tyler informed the doctors that [[Cathy Becker]] was complaining of pain. ''(\"[[I Saw What I Saw]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Aaron Mafrici]] was loudly singing in the ER, Tyler told Alex that Aaron was the consult. ''(\"[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Alex didn't see his patient, [[Emile Flores]], in his bed, he asked Tyler where he was. Tyler didn't know and assumed he had left. ''(\"[[Valentine's Day Massacre]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Tyler saw Owen behind the nurses' station taking a chart, he asked if he could help him, but was dismissed. ''(\"[[Suicide is Painless]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Gary Clark]] shot [[Pete (Season )|Pete]], Pete was brought to the ER. When his wife, [[Shelley]], arrived, she was worried he was dead, but Tyler assured her he wasn't. He then dismissed Clark when he asked Tyler to show him where Derek was. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was running the ER, Tyler was at the desk and helped her with several patients, including [[Oliver Richter]] and [[Mitch Turner]]. ''(\"[[Golden Hour]]\")''\n\n\nWhen there was a virus outbreak in the hospital, Shane went to Tyler and asked him to put the CCU on lockdown, because the conduit trial babies were in there. Tyler refused, but said Shane could take the three trial babies and put them in a separate area, which he could then close, though Tyler advised that he had no extra nurses, so Shane would be on his own. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\n\n\nTyler has made friends with many of the hospital's surgeons while they were still interns, particularly [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], and [[Lexie Grey]].\n\nCristina paid him to guard the door while she stripped for Burke in a hospital room but he had to leave because a patient was coding and Burke's parents entered the room. Tyler later blackmailed Cristina into giving him an electrical appliance by lying to Burke's mother, Jane Burke, and telling her that Cristina was in surgery.\n\n\nTyler worked as a surgical nurse for at least four years at Seattle Grace and helped out the interns a lot. He survived the merger and thereby became part of the staff of\ua[[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital|Seattle Grace Mercy West]]. Currently he is employed at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital|Grey Sloan Memorial]]. One of his shifts included running the [[Coronary Care Unit|CCU]].\n\n\n*Tyler has been credited as Nurse Tyler Christian, Nurse, and Nurse Tyler.\n*Tyler is a possibly a charge nurse as he was in charge of the [[Coronary Care Unit|CCU]] during [[You Be Illin']].\n*Tyler was the first person to say McSteamy, which went on to become Mark Sloan's nickname.

After surviving a near-fatal accident, she resigned from Grey Sloan to help the unhoused who need medical care. She was married to [[Jackson Avery]], with whom she has a deceased son, [[Samuel Norbert Avery|Samuel]], and a daughter, [[Harriet Kepner-Avery]]. She later married her former fianc\ue [[Matthew Taylor]], though the marriage was short-lived. After their split, she ended up moving to Boston with Jackson and their daughter, where the two rekindled their relationship.\n\n\n\nMuch of April's personal life was revealed while she was being held at gunpoint by [[Gary Clark]]. She was forced to tell him personal details about herself in an attempt to prevent him from shooting her. She revealed that she was born on April rd in Columbus, Ohio and was raised on a corn farm in Moline, Ohio along with three sisters, a pet pony, and a pet duck. Her mother is a teacher, while her father stays home and tends to the farm.\n\nWhen April told her parents she wanted to become a doctor, they were \"over the moon\" about it. April has always been very focused on her studies, so other than medical school and various church-related events, she hasn't done much.\n\n\nApril was matched up with [[Lexie Grey]] on her first day at the newly-merged [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. Lexie at first was very mean to her but reconciled with her as she felt bad.<ref>[[Invasion]], x</ref> April was fired shortly after the merger after a mass hotel fire brought an overflow of patients into the ER. Her patient didn't need surgery, but because of a distraction in the ER, April forgot to check down her patient's airway, which was filled with soot. Her patient couldn't breathe and went into cardiac arrest after many hours thinking she was fine aside from some burns. The Chief interrogated all the doctors on duty and eventually fired April, as she was behind the death.<ref>[[I Saw What I Saw]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen [[Derek Shepherd]] became Chief of Surgery, he rehired April, because he thought she deserved a second chance. April admired his abilities and knowledge in his field of work. She had a small work crush on him but nothing developed between them because  Derek's invested in his relationship with Meredith. For a while, she tended to do more administrative work than medicine, in fear of killing someone again. A push from Derek got her to do surgery again.\n\n\nApril lost her best friend, [[Reed Adamson]], the first victim of the shooting. She ran to Derek Shepherd's office and told him what happened. April was right in front of the shooter when he shot Derek, and she told him her life story, stating she hasn't lived yet, nobody had loved her, and the shooter told her to run. She seemed to deal with Reed's loss alone after the shooting.\n\n\nApril is of Christian faith and always prays for her patients before going into surgery. Although elements of her Christianity are traditionally conservative, she is very open-minded \u as she is seen attending [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona's]] wedding, and even dancing and taking pictures of the newlyweds during the reception. She has an extremely close relationship with God and remained a virgin until she was  for this reason.\n\nApril kept her relationship with God a secret from her fellow doctors because she feared they would see her as less of a surgeon because of it. However, when she lost her virginity to [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] the night before her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical boards]], she re-evaluated her faith and stopped caring what others thought about it.\n\n\nShortly after they got back to the hospital after taking their boards, the residents all checked to see if they passed. They all passed except April.<ref>[[Let the Bad Times Roll]], x</ref> She shut down and all the hospitals that offered her a fellowship were now retracting their offers. Her last offer standing was Seattle Grace, but that was also rescinded, leaving her with no place left.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref> She ended up moving back to her parents' and working on their farm until Owen came to get her and take her back to the hospital.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n\nJackson once again said she was getting married. \"Unless I'm not,\" she replied, still asking him to give her a reason not to. When Stephanie came in and started comforting Jackson, April left. While operating on a firefighter who got hurt due to the mudslide caused by the storm, Owen asked April if she said yes to Matthew, whom he helped to prepare the proposal. April said she did, and Owen approved of this, as all first responders are good guys. While her patient's wife said goodbye to her deceased husband, April watched Jackson take his patient to surgery.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nJackson asked April to scrub in with him on a surgery as the interns weren't working due to [[Heather Brooks|Heather's]] death. Suddenly a crying Stephanie appeared and hugged Jackson. April's disappointed look was noticed by Matthew, who then went outside to head back out to the mudslide again. April joined him in the ambulance bay, where he told her that he understood that she wanted Jackson and that he didn't give her a chance to say no because he proposed in front of all these people. He said she wanted to say no. She didn't object to this, and he angrily got in his ambulance and drove off. She scrubbed in with Jackson and tried to talk to him during the surgery, but he snapped at her every time. When they told [[Sasha (Season )|the patient]] and [[Brian (Season )|her fianc\ue]] that her organs were failing and the powerful antibiotics may not work, the couple decided they wanted to get married immediately. As she and Jackson couldn't find any chaplain in the hospital, Jackson got certified online and officiated the wedding. His words touched April, and she tried to talk to him about the wedding afterward. He snapped again, and she asked why he did. She apologized for having asked the question and said there was no need to beat a dead horse. He said that she didn't want him when he wanted her, and she only wanted him now because she was scared by the real relationship she was in. He told her to make up her mind about whether or not she wanted to make a life with Matthew or not. \"None of this has to do with me. This is entirely about you,\" Jackson said, indicating he had no more interest in her. April did make up her mind and dragged Matthew to the hospital's chapel to accept his proposal in private, without pressure. She then proposed to him and clarified that she did have feelings for Jackson and that it got confusing sometimes. She said she never thought that anybody would ever want her with her difficult personality, but that she really wanted him. \"I want to marry you. So will you marry me?\" she asked, after which he took her in his arms and kissed her.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Matthew proposes to April]]\nA few days after having retaken her boards, April was still anxiously waiting to hear about the result. Jackson thought she would pass, and she joked that if she didn't, they'd know it wasn't his fault that she didn't pass the previous year. Callie made her even more nervous with some snappy comments. After surgery, she started thinking that she really didn't pass and they just didn't inform her because it was the second time she failed. Suddenly she got a message, and too nervous to read it herself, she gave her phone to Jackson. He read that she passed, and she delightedly cheered. They gave each other an awkward high five. \"Like you said, it's all you,\" Jackson said. This touched both of them, and they went their separate ways while thinking about what he said.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nAfter finishing up in the ER, April dressed up for the gala. When she got to the party, Jackson begged her to go back to the hospital and grab cooling blankets to cool the champagne, and she obeyed. In the supply closet, April found a crying Arizona, but she pretended to be fine. April returned to the gala, where she heard Callie was telling everyone Arizona had died in the plane crash. She then decided to be a good friend and returned to Arizona with two bottles of champagne. Arizona told April how she felt about everyone judging and staring at her for being a cheater and explained why she cheated. April said she could empathize with others, even though others seemed to think she couldn't because she goes to church. They continued talking about their problems while getting drunker, and April mentioned forgiveness is important and that both Jesus and Matthew see her for who she is and accept her even with what she's done. They ordered Leah to get more champagne and snacks. When they got totally drunk, April and Arizona agreed they had been in need of having fun. April then bluntly asked to try on Arizona's leg, which made them both laugh. At the end of the evening, Leah helped April and Arizona get in a cab to bring them home. April called shotgun to sit in the front as she gets carsick in the back, but she had been drinking so much that she got carsick in the front too.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nSome time after the gala, Arizona was offered coffee by Leah. She questioned what she did to deserve that, but they both don't remember anything about that night. Arizona was afraid she may have slept with Leah. April said she woke up the next morning in the bathtub with her Spanx still on, so they knew that nothing like that had happened to her. In surgery, Owen and Callie were discussing whether or not Emma was his girlfriend for having baked banana bread for. April said that Matthew brought her breakfast burritos and now they were getting married. \"Just saying,\" she said when Owen gave her a look. She defended Arizona when Callie started thinking about kicking Arizona out of their apartment, saying Arizona needed the elevator and that the apartment was handicap accessible. She explained that she and Arizona drunk three bottles of champagne and puked together, which made them bond.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, April and Jackson treated a man who believed he was bitten by a \"zombie\" and believed that he was becoming a zombie now too. In surgery, Jackson got texts from a panicking Stephanie and he told a nurse what to reply. April noticed how sweet his reply was and said he was never that nice to her when she would spin up. He replied he was trying to be a better boyfriend now, but April said that his behavior to her had helped her to get her act together. She said she was getting married, and Jackson joked that was all because of him. After surgery, April showed Jackson how she shuts down someone who's spinning out of control by calming down their patient. In the evening, Matthew organized a Halloween party and April went there dressed as a Velveteen bunny.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nAs a preparation for their wedding, Matthew and April took a compatibility test at their church, on which they scored %. While their reverend was getting their exercises for the next week, Matthew wanted to discuss an important area of their relationship where they are compatible, but not equal. They both wanted to take care of it before the wedding, but they didn't know they were talking about different things. Just as April said they should get a joint checking account, Matthew proposed to have sex. April later turned to Arizona for advice on the sex issue, but Arizona can only say that her sex with Leah is awesome, making April leave in frustration. She went to Matthew in the ambulance bay, and told him she wanted them to commit to one another before having sex, as she wanted their first time on their wedding night to be amazing. Matthew pointed out that he thought that God already knew that he would love her for the rest of his life, and April then remembered that their reverend told them to support one another, so she agreed to have sex if it was so important for him, which it was. However, in the evening, April remember how she lost herself after having lost her virginity, and she stated that she loved and respected him too much to see him stumble the way she did. She said their first time would be amazing, and if they would have their first time now, he only would have broken a promise, which she didn't want to do to him. They then agreed to wait until their wedding night and lean on each other for support until then, after which they started kissing and hugging.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\nA couple of days later, April started asking her colleagues' mail addresses to send them invitations to her wedding. All of the guests are allowed to bring a plus one. Stephanie found it out that she was getting an invitation and was allowed to bring a plus one, as she thought Jackson would get an invitation too. She talked to Jackson about this, who then went to April to ask her if she knew he and Stephanie were serious. She did, and then explained why Stephanie received an invitation too. Jackson wasn't getting an invitation, as Matthew didn't want to invite him, but April figured that he would come as Stephanie's plus one. Jackson questioned why he should come to the wedding if sending an invitation is already causing problems for Matthew. April replied he had to come because he was her friend and she wanted him there. He replied he wanted to come, and she then asked for their blessing. Without it, she wouldn't be able to go through with it. He gave her his blessing, but still wasn't sure he would be at the wedding.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref> Jackson went to the wedding as Stephanie's plus one. Near the end of the ceremony, Jackson stood up and declared his love for April.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref> Jackson and April ran out of the church, leaving Matthew at the alter and eloped themselves.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter treating a patient with deaf parents, Jackson and April realized that they had completely different ideas on how to raise their kids. April felt like Jackson wouldn't respect the religious traditions she wanted to teach her kids, and they got into a huge fight. April temporarily moved in with Callie and Arizona, feeling this fight would already end their marriage. When she went home to pick up her iPod, Jackson asked her to end their fight, as the children they were discussing were hypothetical after all. April then revealed they weren't hypothetical anymore, as she was pregnant accidentally.\n\nDuring their first ultrasound, things were awkward as they didn't know how to behave because of their fight. They were sure they didn't want to terminate the pregnancy, and both April and Jackson were happy about the pregnancy. Their discussion was resolved when Jackson decided he'd accompany his wife and children to church, as he felt that was really important for his wife. They planned on waiting to share the pregnancy with their families until after the first trimester, but when Callie and Stephanie accidentally found out, they decided it wasn't necessary to keep the pregnancy a secret and they shared it with their colleagues and family. A possible terrorist attack made April insecure about bringing a child into the evil world, but Catherine told her that there's only one way to change that world: good people raising their babies right. That calmed April down and gave her confidence that she would raise the baby right.\n\nWhen April's mother visited for the first time, April found that her mother meddled too much. Her mother and Jackson decorated the entire nursery, making her feel left out. April mother's told her that she didn't want to take anything from April at all. She was very proud of April when she saw her in her natural environment, the hospital, although she didn't understand a thing from what April does all day. However, she does know a lot about raising babies, so that's why she wanted to help. April then realized she had acted wrong and apologized to her mother, promising her to call her when she needed more help. She went home to Jackson. They agreed she was a jerk. She told Jackson he'd be a great dad, visibly looking forward to welcoming their baby in the new nursery.\n\nApril and Jackson decided to keep the sex of the baby a surprise as April wanted it to be. After losing a pregnant patient in the OR, April was a little shocked, but she was faithful that everything would turn out right for her, as it was all in God's hands. During a routine ultrasound, Stephanie accidentally revealed to April that the baby was a boy. Unbeknownst to April, she found out there was something wrong with the baby. Jackson found out when Herman and Stephanie were talking about this, so he was the one to deliver the news to April. Unable to deal with it just yet, April dove into work in the busy ER and avoided talking about it, although she lashed out at Stephanie for telling other people about the baby's diagnosis before telling her. After having treated every possible patient, April and Jackson talked. April researched the disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, and found out about the different types of the disease, although she didn't want to know what type their son had. April had difficulties understanding why God would do this to her, as she'd always done everything right for Him. When she finally informed Jackson that they were having a boy, she fell apart and cried in his arms.\n\nAs Jackson wanted to know everything they could get to know, they ran a test to find out what type their baby was suffering from. However the results would turn out, she wanted to keep the baby, loving and holding him as long as possible. Her mother came over and they spent the day at church. At home, Jackson and Karen started arguing over whether or not the test results were necessary. April stopped the fighting and yelled that their different opinions weren't helping her at all, actually only making her more sad, scared and feeling alone. After comforting each other all night, April and Jackson discussed the test results with Herman.\n\nTheir baby was diagnosed with type II, meaning he'd die minutes or hours after birth. His bones were breaking inside the womb, devastating April. Jackson and April worked out a plan with Catherine, inducing labor and cherishing and baptizing the baby before their son would pass away. They had a difficult moment when Herman pushed the paperwork onto them, including a death certificate. April didn't want to sign it yet, but she did want to continue with the plan. However, right before inducing, April decided she couldn't do it yet, because they hadn't figured out a name yet and mostly because she was still hoping for a miracle, and she returned to the ER to work. There, she helped a grieving woman work through her fianc\ue's death. While comforting the woman, April reconnected with God and found her faith again, assuring the woman she was strong enough to get through this, indirectly also talking to herself with God's words. This encounter made April feel ready and she and Jackson settled on naming their son Samuel Norbert Avery. Moments later, the labor was induced. Herman delivered the baby and April and Jackson cherished him in their arms. A priest came to baptize the baby and Samuel squeezed April's finger, letting go shortly after. Not long after, Samuel passed away. Jackson took his wife home while both remembering significant events from their lives as a couple.\n[[File:xSamuelbirth.png|thumb|xpx|April gives birth to Samuel Norbert Avery]]\nApril and Jackson asked everyone for privacy. April felt sad and angry about God and the baby and needed space and time to herself to deal with these feelings. She first returned to the hospital when Dr. Herman had her brain tumor removed, as April wanted to be with Herman on her worst day like Herman had done for her. She later returned to work in the ER.\n\nApril was still hurt about losing Samuel and made the decision to go work with Dr. Hunt in a war zone. She initially would be gone for three months but kept postponing her return, upsetting Jackson. She returned almost a year later, appearing more confident but also more distant. Jackson blamed Dr. Hunt for changing her.\n\nLater on, she was offered another chance to go to Jordan as a field surgeon. After an explosion in the tunnels, April realized that she needed to go back because it was what she loved. Jackson felt like she was abandoning him again when he needed her the most so he offered her an ultimatum. If she chooses to leave, he told her that he wasn't sure that he could be there when she came back. April knew it was her calling to go back to Jordan and she left. Regretful about his ultimatum, Jackson bought a ticket on the same flight as April but realized he was too late and missed the flight. \n\nWhen April returned for the second time, she was met with hostility by Jackson because he felt that she was never there when he needed her and only believed that she was hurting when he was suffering too. She had left him when what he needed to survive was her. She continued to push Jackson to rethink their marriage and they decided to try couples therapy after Jackson professed that he wanted her. But they recognized that they were divided beyond repair, agreed to divorce. \n\nOn the day of the divorce signing, April and Jackson look at their relationship over the last + years. April asks a tearful Jackson if he really wants this and eventually signs the papers and leaves immediately with tears streaming down her face. After the signing, Arizona offered alcohol to April and then joked around, asking if she was pregnant when she refused a drink. April responded saying that she was.<ref name=\":\">[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref>\n\nApril and Jackson went out for dinner and discussed plans for their baby. Jackson said he wanted to be in the room for the birth and April replied that she wanted him there. After, they discussed holiday plans. April would be with the child for Easter and Jackson would have the Super Bowl and Halloween. They decided to switch off every year for Christmas.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn the day of [[Owen and Amelia's Wedding]], April went back to Meredith's house with Ben to get the rings. While they were there, she went into labor. Ben had to perform a crash C-section on her with no anesthetic. She and the baby were then brought to Grey Sloan Memorial so she could have surgery.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nFollowing the surgery, April recovered in a room. Catherine came to Seattle to meet her granddaughter and she was told by April that she and Jackson had named the baby Harriet, after Harriet Tubman. Catherine assumed the baby's last name was to be Avery, but April told her they were hyphenating since the name Kepner means good things where she comes from.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref> Harriet was soon cleared to go home, but April needed to stay in the hospital for wound therapy. Before taking his daughter home, Jackson stopped by her room. April started crying as she feared she would be missing out on bonding moments, so she told Jackson to leave with Harriet so she could stop crying. Jackson then called her from home to check on her. They talked for a moment about how April would take care of Harriet once she could leave the hospital. Jackson suggested a baby nurse, but April made it clear she couldn't afford that and that she did not want his help since they were separated. Later that night, Jackson FaceTimed April because Harriet wouldn't go back to sleep, so April sang to her to lull her back to sleep. When he visited the next day, Jackson suggested to move in with him so they could take care of their daughter together until she was fully healed. She initially refused because she needed boundaries, but promised him she'd think about it.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\nHer incision healed well and she was allowed to go home. She got bored at home and visited the hospital to get some movement. She dropped Harriet with Jackson and went to check on the ER. Later, she fed Harriet and bonded with Alex over being out of the game for a while. At the end of the day, she admitted she was bored, so Jackson took their daughter so she could treat a patient in the ER.<ref>[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]], x</ref>\n\nApril started to annoy him by being determined to be a perfect guest, but after a talk with Jackson, she came to realize she was his roommate and didn't have to feel like a guest.\n\n\nCatherine manipulated the situation when Jackson and Meredith were supposed to treat a girl with laryngeal cancer in Montana. She knew Jackson took the case because the hospital was close to where his father lived, so she had Meredith switch with April, figuring she'd offer a better support system. April and a grumpy Jackson continuously butted heads until she found out the real reason behind the trip and confronted him about it. They continued to work together to find a solution and eventually when they did, they ended up having sex given their track record in hotels. \n\nAfter returning to Seattle, April let the situation linger for weeks and focused on work. When an explosion occurred, April found out through Maggie that Jackson stayed in the building to look for Stephanie. He later exited the hospital carrying a patient. Both Maggie and April yelled at him for his heroic behavior that worried them. April noticed the way Maggie handled his oxygen mask and the way she and Jackson looked at each other. After things had calmed down, Maggie came to apologize as she felt her scolding Jackson was out of line, since April was the one who should be yelling at him given their shared daughter. April then told Maggie that she could tell that Jackson liked her, and she felt like Maggie liked him, too. She advised Maggie to tell him how she felt, and headed out for incoming patient.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, April and Arizona had lunch where they talked about Eliza ghosting Arizona. April pointed out Eliza at least made her intentions clear, unlike Jackson after their Montana escapade.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref> Jackson found out what April had told Maggie and wanted to address this, but April dodged the question. Nathan's lingering love triangle with Megan and Meredith made her realize that she needed clarification from Jackson. That night at home, Jackson again asked to talk about Maggie, but April instead admitted that she had actually been wanting to talk about what had happened in Montana. Unlike him, she wasn't good at compartmentalizing, so the situation caused her pain. She told him that she had spent weeks wondering what it meant and if it was just casual sex, that was something she wasn't comfortable with. She then decided it was time for her to move out, since their situation was causing her pain.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref> Her moving out also meant that she had to adjust to nights without Harriet. She hung around the hospital as she had trouble going home without her daughter. Arizona recognized that from own life and assured her that it becomes a new normal.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nApril continued to use Tinder as she wanted to date someone from outside the hospital. April later attended the intern mixer to mingle with the newest group of interns. She witnessed Richard announcing Meredith's nomination for the Harper Avery Award.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref> On the day of the Harper Avery ceremony, April and Meredith operated together while Meredith actually had to leave for the ceremony. April thought she was taking her talent for granted while she had to work hard just to be average. Meredith assured her she wanted the Award badly and was sticking around because their patient reminded her of Cristina. She assured April she was not average.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\n\nApril was in charge of running the ER when the hospital computer system was hacked, rendering the monitors, bloodbank, and drugs unavailable. April learned new tricks from Richard, who was the only doctor with experience from before medicine was influenced by technology.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> After successfully running the ER until the crisis was resolved, Richard approached April and said he felt too old to run the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. April, unaware that he wanted to hand over the reigns in order to be able to participate himself, happily jumped at the chance to take over being the judge.\n\nThe next morning, April worked on [[Paul Stadler]] after a hit-a-run.<ref>[[---]], x</ref> Meredith urged her not to lose him. When briefing Owen, he questioned why she wasn't participating in the contest. She then realized Richard had played her and went to give the contest back to him, but he refused. Soon after, [[Karin Taylor]] ended up in the ER in labor. As April was delivering the baby, she was shocked to see that Karin's husband was [[Matthew Taylor]], her ex-fianc\ue. The baby was taken to the NICU. When April went to check on Karin, she told April that she had heard a lot about her and made it clear she did not want to hear April's side of the story. April had to treat another patient, [[David Roman]], who attempted to cut off his hand to keep himself from masturbating per the Bible's instructions. April helped him to understand metaphors. Meanwhile, April noticed the impact [[Eric Sterling|Eric Sterling's]] case had on her colleagues, as the boy was shot by the police while trying to enter his own house through the window.\n\nShe was paged back to Karin Taylor's bed since Karin was experiencing pain. Both admitting to an awkward situation, April examined and found a vulvar hematoma, which she drained. Afterwards, April joined her colleagues as they were waiting for Eric's scans. Upon returning to the ER, Matthew was arguing with [[Taryn Helm]] over Karin not being sent to a private room yet. April instructed Taryn to make that happen. She then had a talk with Matthew, who figured she was still with Jackson and a -year-old. April chose not to fill him in on the painful loss of Samuel and talked about Harriet instead. Later, Karin ended up in extreme pain, but April had to hand her over to Arizona as her help was necessary for Eric. However, her colleagues had it covered as soon as they arrived in the OR and sent her away. She was then shocked to see on the board that Arizona was operating on Karin. She went to check and was told that Karin had DIC and HELLP syndrome. Arizona had already removed her uterus and wondered why April hadn't called her sooner.\n\nGuilt-ridden, April went to the chapel, where she ran into Matthew. He ignored her and left. She then broke down in the chapel. After leaving, she came to find that Eric had died. She heard Jackson's speech about police bias and when asked for a statement by an officer, she said that she couldn't have faith in a system where an officer shot and killed a boy trying to enter his own house. Richard then paged her to David's room. While he had made a full recovery, he had come to question the meaning of the Bible and faith. He asked her for guidance, but, thoroughly shaken by the events of that day, she was unable to provide an answer. She was further shaken to find out that Paul Stadler had died while he only had a concussion, but the real shock came when she went to the ICU to check on Karin, only to arrive to see her being zipped into a body bag. Distraught and having lost God in the face of all the unfairness and inequity and cruelty she had been confronted with that day, she ended up watching a grieving Matthew with his daughter in the ICU, after which she went to the bar to drink. She was approached by [[Vikram Roy]] and ended up sleeping with him at her place. The next morning, he joined her in the shower.<ref name=\":\">[[Personal Jesus]], x</ref>\n\nShe continued to sleep with Vik as her downward spiral continued. She arrived to work late and hungover to post the rules to the contest, which the doctors were eagerly waiting for. They had three days to turn in an essay on their proposed projects. While running from Vik, who didn't seem to understand her no-daylight rule, she found Arizona delving into the US's maternal mortality statistics after the loss of Karin Taylor. After three days, April and the team of esteemed surgeons she had assembled read through all the proposals and chose  of them to receive seed money.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nApril continued to come to work hungover from the night before, even going as far as using banana bags to help her sober up. As she came to greet Harriet in daycare before starting her day, Jackson expressed some concern over her, but she brushed it off. April had earned herself the nickname The Party among the interns while Vik openly bragged about his sexual experiences with her, which further worried Jackson. At the end of the day, he confronted her, but she told him he wasn't her that and left as she had plans. While Arizona had brushed off Jackson's concerns at first, she came to see they were valid when she entered the bar and witnessed April standing on a table and pouring shots for the interns as they chanted.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nHer downward spiral also resulted in a no-nonsense attitude. When a group of rugby players ended up in the ER, they tossed around their ball and hit April as she was draining an outer ear bleed, resulting her accidentally cutting the ear off. Later, one of the rugby players requested another doctor based on the accident. April punished him for that by assigning him an intern. Owen then took her aside and told her to go home for the day, as Bailey had found out about the incident before April had reported it and requested an investigation. She lashed out as she thought it was unfair she was getting punished for someone else not following the rules. That night, April attended Maggie's game night with her own booze. She teamed up with [[Tom Koracick]]. All throughout the night, she made sure everybody follow the rules to the letter and speeched about their importance in making sure life wasn't meaningless. After Maggie's boyfriend's wife showed up, the night ended abruptly. An inebriated April seductively asked Tom for a ride, to which he eagerly agreed.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nHe stayed overnight. She wanted him to leave so she could vomit in private, but he stayed to look for breakfast. As she was mixing herself a Bloody Mary, he looked around her home and concluded that the warm-hearted woman who lived there and acted as Amelia's healthy proxy was currently nowhere to be found. He wondered how she became the April he had met the night before. He started guessing and eventually hit the crisis of faith. April then finally admitted out loud that she hated God so much that she wished He were dead. They stayed at her place all day for more sex. Over takeout, April expressed her anger at people who blatantly disregard His teachings and receive absolutely no punishment, while people who spend their lives trying to emulate and honor Him are brutally mistreated, like she felt she had been. Tom opened up about his own crisis of faith after losing his son and inquired about the reason behind her crisis of faith, but she avoided the question by initiating more sex. Due to their talks, she forgot she was supposed to have Harriet that night and was surprised when Jackson showed up to drop her off. He noticed her state of mind and offered to keep Harriet, but she took her daughter and closed the door on him right after he saw Tom in April's robe.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day at work, April insisted Owen let her join on trauma certification day for the interns. She severely worsened the fictional situation that injured the dummies and instructed the interns that there were no rules in this harsh, uncaring world. One by one, she declared the dummies dead with surprise twists and had Andrew pretend he was hurt by a piece of shrapnell from yet another plane. April then went on to use a hose to simulate rain to mimic her own trauma cert day until she was paged to the ICU. When she returned from a wild goose chase, Taryn told her that Casey had set that up to get her away. He defended himself and stated she was the biggest threat to their patients. She started laughing because he cheated the system like she had done herself, which resulted in the death of a car crash victim she was unable to save. Andrew offered a time-out, but April broke down and said God doesn't just stop handing out traumas. She then completely spun out of control and frantically started performing CPR on a dummy she had made up a life story for. Eventually, she came back to her senses and wandered inside.\n\nShe ran into Jackson, who took her into a supply closet and demanded to know what had been going on with her. He wondered when she decided they weren't friends anymore. He assured her he was there for her. She then hugged him and kissed him. He immediately broke it off and told her to face whatever was wrong with her. She then told him to take Harriet that night if he really wanted to help. Later, while putting the dummies back in storage, she broke down and cried by herself in the dark.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nShe continued to drink, at one time even falling asleep at the bar. She was woken up the bartender and went to work. She started treating rabbi [[Eli Rigler]], who came in for a rash. April examined him and diagnosed toxic epidermal necrolysis, a side effect from the antibiotics Bailey had prescribed him for the third time for diverticulitis. Eli was transported to the burn unit, where Jackson and April made him comfortable. While he didn't want to worry his wife, they told him his condition was worse enough to call her. Privately, April lashed out at Bailey for prescribing the antibiotics instead of performing surgery. Jackson defended Bailey, but April firmly said they all knew that Eli was dying and that his death was on Bailey.\n\nLater, April went to check on him and told him his wife was on her way. He refused to be given more medication before his wife's arrival. He saw a worried Bailey hovering outside and told April it was okay for her to come in, though April refused that. He noticed April disliked her for her decision while he himself didn't blame her. He figured out that April was in pain and offered to help to take it away, which he considered his job. For the first time in a long time, she opened up and shared that she was doubting her faith because of all the bad things that happened to her. She said she was taking care of herself for once rather than following His rules, because apparently that didn't make good things happen to her. He told her there are no guarantees for a life free of suffering or injustice in faith. He stated faith wouldn't be real faith if people only believe when things are good. Horrible things happen and nobody knows why. People can either believe in God or believe that to be pointless, whichever makes them happier. He asked her if she was happy, which made her cry. He saw her unimaginable pain, a feeling he knew well. He believed God wasn't indifferent to their pain. He said the world was full of brokenness and that it was their job to put it back together. She then asked to let her take some of his pain away, but he stated she already did by opening up to him about her pain. He told April to tell Bailey that he forgave her. She tried to get him to hang on to see his wife, but he believed her to be his wife as he started dying. She rolled with it and comforted him until he passed.\n\nAfter his death, April went to the chapel and found a guilt-ridden Bailey there, trying to light a candle. April assisted her and told her that some things just happen and people don't get to know why, like Eli had told her.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, April came to work with her faith restored. She started the day out in the chapel to gather strength. She then spent the entire day apologizing to people that she had treated badly during her crisis of faith. They all forgave her. While she had avoided Jackson throughout the day, she approached him at daycare to ask if she could have Harriet. She assured him she was good and finally told him that she lost God after losing her patients for no reason. That had never happened to her before and it scared and angered her. She explained that all throughout their marriage, she wanted Jackson to know God like she did, but he never. And then she lost God and it made her feel like Jackson somehow had won, which she hated and made her hate him. She realized that Jackson was there for her while God wasn't and she thanked him for that. April ran into Maggie on the way out and apologized to her, especially for game night. Maggie still hated that she slept with a married man. April then related her own poor choices to her, saying she slept with the douchey intern and Tom Koracick and also jumped her ex-husband in the closet.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Matthew came to the hospital with his daughter, April hovered outside the room while Arizona examined the girl. Matthew requested another doctor and Arizona suggested Owen. April then took over in the ER so he was free to do so. April continued to hover and told Owen that she had a feeling it was a gastrointestinal problem, which turned out to be correct. Owen gave her credit when he told Matthew the diagnosis. April later ran into Matthew in the chapel. He scooted over and allowed her to sit with him.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nOn [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest|Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest Prototypes Day]], April ate some cookies that contained peanut-butter cannabis and became high as a result. With the judge and several contestants high, the Prototypes Day was postponed. All the high doctors were placed in a room together, though all wandered around. April overheard the conversation where Catherine and Jackson talked about Harper Avery being a sexual predator. She told Bailey and also shared that she was secretly seeing someone. Together, they held a funeral for Harper and his reputation, which led to Meredith finding out.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the scandal about Harper Avery broke to the press, Maggie found out that Jackson had funded the Contest himself. April was shocked upon finding out and went to yell at Richard for setting her up to look like she was in cahoots with her ex-husband. Later that day, she overheard Jo and Alex failing at wedding planning and offered to do it for them, which they happily accepted. Maggie later came to apologize to April, who assured Maggie that Jackson had a reasonable explanation for what he did.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nJackson tried to deal with the scandal by paying the personal settlements with his money, since the new Catherine Fox Foundation had to use all of its money to keep the Avery hospitals afloat. Jackson paged April and told her that he had set aside a substantial amount of money for their daughter, so she would never have to worry. April deeply appreciated it and thanked him. She told him he was on the right path.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nAfter sending out the wedding invitations to Alex and Jo's wedding, April was picked up by Matthew for their volunteer work at a clinic. April warned Matthew for a curve, but they ended up in a car accident. Disoriented, April got out of the car and called , but she fell into a ravine by the road and ended up in partially submerged in a cold river. The first responders didn't know she was there and took Matthew to the hospital. Matthew uttered April's name and since they couldn't reach her, the doctors started to worry about April. Owen had the paramedics take him to the scene of the accident and found her several hours after the accident. She was ice cold and had no vitals. Refusing to declare her dead until she was warm and dead, the attendings and interns worked together to perform CPR and warm her up. Maggie put April on cardiopulmonary bypass in the OR while they continued to warm her up. Jackson found out three hours after the doctors started treatment. They all stood around and prayed for a heartbeat. Maggie noticed what she thought to be V-fib and defibrillated time and time again, which eventually resulted in a rhythm. They all cheered and April was moved to the ICU. She didn't wake up and they all started to fear for brain damage. All of April's friends gathered around her bed.\n\nArizona was one of the last people to find out and told the others that April and Matthew were seeing each other again. They had both been through so much since they separated and understood each other's pain, which made them fall in love again. They decided to keep it a secret because they didn't want judgment or opinions on Matthew not waiting long enough after his wife's death. They all continued to pray for April, but Amelia eventually deemed it time to call her family as April still hadn't woken up.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Jackson prays to God to bring April back.]]\nThe doctors left Jackson alone with April. He believed she was still there and even started praying to God to bring April back. She woke up moments later. All her loved ones were happy to have her back. She remembered calling  and falling and being unable to get up, and then she felt warmer and safer, and eventually woke up to a praying Jackson. She was convinced she didn't really die as she hadn't met Jesus, which she was sure she would if she actually died. They then all left to let her rest. Owen was the last to leave and April expressed her gratitude by saying he always comes to bring her back. Maggie later came to check on her and said Jackson was willing to bring Harriet by any time she wanted. April decided to wait till the next day as to not scare her. Bailey then brought Matthew by for a visit. Their beds were placed in the same room for the night and they slept holding hands.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the accident, April quit her job to do God's work, which meant devoting herself entirely to the clinic providing healthcare access for Seattle's unhoused community. She and Matthew continued to spend time together with their daughters.\n\nWeeks later, the time finally arrived for Jo and Alex's wedding. While she had perfectly organized everything to the last detail, she made a mistake on the GPS link, causing the majority of guests to be late. When they finally arrived, everyone complimented April's work on the location and Catherine invited April to Sunday dinner. April then went to check if Jo and Alex were ready, only to discover that they had disappeared. April encouraged everyone to set out to find them. She sat down with Arizona and convinced her that falling in love with Callie again after all the hurt she caused wasn't a catastrophe, giving her rekindled love with Matthew as an example that people change and that life changes them. The real wedding catastrophe arrived when [[Kirsten]] went into anaphylactic shock. The doctors worked together to crike her and had her taken to a local hospital. The entire experience and the fact that the minister still hadn't showed up ruined the wedding. While the rest of the guests and Jo and Alex took the ferry back to the city, a disappointed April stayed behind with Matthew, Arizona, Jackson, and Sofia to clean up the mess.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Matthew proposes to April.|xpx]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|April and Matthew get married.|xpx]]\nMatthew seized the opportunity to say that he wanted to give them a second chance at marriage. He loved who she was five years ago and he loved who she was today even more. He also loved how she trusted God and how she talked to Ruby and prayed with Harriet. He told her she saved him and his daughter. He knew it was crazy, but he didn't want to waste any more time. He proposed to her and she happily accepted. At that very moment, the minister finally arrived at the right location and the newly engaged couple decided to get married right then and there. April asked Jackson to stay because of how special he was in her life. Arizona compiled a bridal bouquet and Sofia served as the flower girl. Arizona walked April down the aisle. April and Matthew were then married by the minister in an intimate and Christian ceremony, marking the start of their new life together.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Jackson wants to move to Boston and Needs April to come]]\nYears later, Jackson approached April about moving to Boston because he wanted to run the Catherine Fox Foundation but didn't want to leave their daughter. He said that if April didn't agree, he wouldn't go even though he felt like it was his calling. After a night of talking and fighting about it, the next morning, April, though hesitant at first, ultimately agreed to move to Boston with Jackson and their daughter. Jackson, while happy and excited about April agreeing to move, thought it wouldn't be so simple and that she would have had to talk to Matthew first, to which April revealed that her and Matthew had split, explaining how at first, the two thought that it was God's plan to bring them back together after all their pain, but Matthew still resented her for leaving him at the altar. When Matthew's sister got sick, he and his daughter, Ruby, went to Philadelphia to care for her and never returned. She also explained how it was her way of dealing with her guilt of leaving Matthew at the altar. All in all, she explained that it was essentially a trauma marriage. She explained that she didn't want to tell Jackson they split up because there were so many casualties in the world and she didn't think her marriage counted as one. Jackson also teased her, saying she had too much pride and she jokingly agreed.<ref>[[Look Up Child]], x</ref>\n\nWhile in Boston, she and Jackson grew closer to one another again and rekindled their relationship.<ref>[[You Are the Blood]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen April first arrived at the hospital, she was extremely insecure and wrote notes to herself in a personal diary to help cope with her insecurities. She wrote notes telling herself nobody could tell she has had plastic surgery on [[File:x-.png|thumb|left|April cheering on her fellow teammates.]]her nose, and that she could one day be the future of medicine. Although April seems to be a little bit fragile, the shooting at the hospital proved that she is much stronger than she seems.\n\nSince making some new friends at the hospital, April seems to have become much more confident in herself and her abilities, and little by little showed more of her personality. It's been noted by [[Owen Hunt]] that although April panics under pressure, she shows promise as a trauma surgeon due to her tenaciousness. Along with being extremely organized, April is also very competitive - refusing to give up until she wins. April's most noticeable quality is her ability to read people. She's extremely receptive and notices things that most people would overlook. Also, unlike most of her peers, April is a morning person. She is also compassionate and understanding. April also cares deeply about her friends and patients. Along with those qualities, she also has some flaws - such as her inability to filter what she says and the extreme anxiety that causes her to come off as annoying. April also has a tendency to push people away and shut them out when she is hurt. April can also become very emotional over little things.  \n\nAfter losing her child, she seems to be much stronger and more serious about everything.\n\n\n\nJoseph\nShe went to the homecoming dance with a boy named Joseph.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nShe had a big crush on the married [[Derek Shepherd]] following the merger. Jackson said of the crush, \"she thinks he walks on water\" to Meredith.\n\n[[Robert Stark]]\nDuring a time in pediatrics, [[Robert Stark]] flirted with her. April didn't want to pursue a relationship with him and declined an invitation to Robert's apartment for dinner. They remained friendly after that.\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Jackson protecting April.]]\nAfter the shooting at the hospital, Jackson and April became close when she noticed he'd been having nightmares about the tragedy. He then grew very protective of her - claiming she was the only friend he had left.\nApril has always been very close to God, and she says she remained a virgin so long due to her religion - which Jackson respected. However, she decided to sleep with him the night before their [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical boards]], giving up her virginity and putting somewhat of a strain on their friendship.\n\nWhen April returned to Seattle Grace Mercy West, she informed Jackson she was \"revirginizing\". He didn't support this action because he felt she was trying to pretend they never happened, but he promised to help her in any way that he could. However, in the end, no matter how hard they tried to stay away, they couldn't resist each other.\n\nAt the point of their relationship in which Jackson established that he had feelings for April and he was hurt that she referred to their relationship as a ''dessert'' or a ''car crash'', April noticed that her period was  days late. Because she'd never been so late before, she thought she was pregnant. While waiting for the results of the pregnancy test, Jackson told her that he was all in and that they would have a wonderful wedding with butterflies and that they would raise the kid together. However, the test came back negative, to which April responded with relief and delight. She said to Jackson that they dodged a big bullet and that they wouldn't have to get married anymore. This hurt Jackson's feelings and he broke up with her - stating that perhaps this was a sign they shouldn't be together.\n\nSoon after, Jackson began seeing intern Stephanie, which first started out as only a sexual relationship. Jackson told April himself, thinking it would hurt her even more if she heard from anyone else. April was glad that he did and thanked him, but confessed she still had some feelings for him and wasn't ready yet to be friends again. However, she soon met Matthew and they both concentrated on their own relationships. Jackson and April did become friends again, however, when April asked Jackson for advice on whether or not she should tell Matthew the truth about her virginity.\n\nDuring a massive storm near the hospital, a bus flipped and the doctors had to rush in and evacuate as many people as possible. The doctors believed they got to everyone, but Jackson stayed behind because he noticed a small pink shoe. When April noticed Jackson wasn't with them, she began to panic and rushed back towards the bus as it lay there ablaze, but was stopped by [[Matthew Taylor|Matthew]]. Suddenly, the bus exploded. Thinking Jackson was in the explosion, April became hysterical. When he emerged from the fire with a small child, she ran to hug him but was stopped by Matthew - who was trying to comfort her.\n\nWhen Jackson was being treated by Callie for his injuries, April walked in furious, screaming at him for almost dying, but was quickly removed by Callie and Matthew. Thinking she had lost Jackson made her realize her true feelings for him. When everyone calmed down, she went back in to see him. She told him that she wanted him and not Matthew - which Jackson quickly rebuffed by telling her she was marrying Matthew soon. April then told Jackson to give her a reason not to. Jackson said her reaction had nothing to do with him and that she should leave him out of it; he stayed with Stephanie, she with Matthew.\n\nAlthough Jackson and April were seeing different people, they remained friends.\n\nOn the day of April's wedding, she ran into Jackson at the hospital while searching for [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] and [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]. Jackson had previously told April he wouldn't be attending her wedding, but she asked him one more time if he would be there. He asked if she really wanted him there and she said yes. During the ceremony, however, Jackson broke up with [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] and told April he loved her and that he always has loved her in front of the entire crowd. It was later revealed that April and Jackson got married.\n\nAfter working on [[Jill Kasliner]], Jackson and April fought about how they would raise their children. April walked out and ended up staying with Arizona and Callie for a few days. She came back to retrieve her iPod and told Jackson that they couldn't table the discussion about how they'll raise their children any longer because she's pregnant. During her second trimester, April and Jackson discovered that their unborn son had Osteogenesis Imperfecta. After a series of tests, they soon learned that their son, whom they decided to name Samuel, suffered from type , the most fatal type. Their son died shortly after his induced birth.\n\nShe later left to serve as a trauma surgeon in the Army, causing stress on her marriage with Jackson. When she returned from her first tour, she and Jackson seemed to be in a good place; however, when April revealed that she would be returning to Jordan, Jackson told her that he would not be there when she got back. When April returned from the Middle East, she was eager to rekindle and fix her relationship with Jackson. However, Jackson was deeply hurt as he felt that she abandoned him and he did not wish to get back together. April declared that she would fight for their relationship until her death. Jackson suggested that they get a divorce and he moved into Ben and Bailey's house to stay separated from April as she would not leave on her own. Jackson and April had a nice dinner in hopes of talking about their relationship, but unfortunately, she was paged and they never got to the real conversation. April and Jackson later slept together. Afterward, April was avoiding a conversation with Jackson while he was eager to talk to her. April told Jackson that she knew what he was going to say about the fact that they had sex. He exclaimed that she had no idea. While Meredith was in the hospital, April and Jackson had an argument because Jackson served her divorce papers.\n\nThey later signed the papers shortly after April found out that she was pregnant with Jackson's baby.<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref> April refused to tell Jackson about the pregnancy. However, Arizona and Alex were worried about her, so Arizona ended up telling Jackson, shocking April.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref> Jackson was furious with April for not telling him herself. He went to her, asking to be involved and suggesting that she was waiting until it was too late for an early abortion. She said it was her body and therefore her decision.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nYears later, Jackson approached April about moving to Boston because he wanted to run the Catherine Fox Foundation but didn't want to leave their daughter. Though hesitant at first, April ultimately agreed to move to Boston with Jackson and their daughter. Jackson, while ecstatic about April agreeing to move, thought it wouldn't be so simple and that she would have had to talk to Matthew first. April then informed Jackson that she and Matthew had split up.<ref>[[Look Up Child]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and April eventually rekindled their relationship in Boston.\n\n[[Matthew Taylor]]\nA new paramedic at the hospital, Matthew has recently caught the attention of April, as he awkwardly asked her on a date after confessing to watching her for some time but he assured her he was not a stalker.\n\nThey were later seen bonding in an ambulance when Matthew receives a call about a nearby trauma. April rides along with him and they come across a hit and run accident involving a ten-year-old boy. April saves his life by assembling her fellow doctors to operate although [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] was no longer a trauma center at the time. When the doctors were eventually caught operating on the boy, [[Meredith Grey]] protected April by claiming him as her patient and \"accidentally\" deleting incriminating evidence from the new system. [[Alex Karev]] and [[Jackson Avery]] also defended April during a meeting with [[Owen Hunt]] about the situation.\n\nWhen all is said and done and the young boy is stable, April runs into Matthew on her way home from the hospital. He tells her she is the bravest, strongest, and most beautiful woman he has ever met. He tells her whenever he's around her, he loses all thoughts. April, flattered and somewhat shocked, kisses Matthew - much to the dismay of a jealous Jackson as he passes by with Stephanie.\n\nWhen April turns to Jackson for advice before a date with Matthew, Jackson reveals to April that his relationship with Stephanie is purely sexual and they're not romantically involved with each other. April then confesses to Jackson that she is unsure how to explain to Matthew that she is no longer a virgin, but still wishes to wait until marriage before having sex again. Jackson jokingly responds by saying he's going to think she's mentally ill, but April takes him seriously and her feelings are hurt. He later apologizes, however, and tells April to be honest with Matthew, stating that once he gets to know her, he will want to follow her anywhere.\n\nWhen April found out Matthew was saving himself for marriage - like she intended to do before sleeping with Jackson, she told him she was saving herself for marriage, as well - leaving out the fact that she was no longer a virgin. When she finally confessed to Matthew that she had lied, he was hurt, but accepted her for who she was.\n\nApril and Matthew were engaged to be married. He proposed to her via flashmob and she said yes, smiling from ear to ear and crying tears of joy.\n\nThey had a few bumps before the wedding, but they made it through. At the wedding ceremony, Jackson stood up in front of everyone and told her he loved her and he always loved her. April didn't respond. Matthew looked angry. Then she decided to run away with Jackson, leaving Matthew at the altar.\n\nFive years later, after divorcing Jackson, April was reunited with Matthew after helping his wife Karin deliver their baby. After Karin's death, they started seeing each other again, having matured from their first relationship and were married in a private ceremony witnessed by Arizona, Jackson, and Arizona's daughter Sofia.\n\nLater, April revealed to Jackson that she and Matthew had separated. At first, the two thought that it was God's plan to bring them back together after all their pain, but Matthew still resented her for leaving him at the altar. When Matthew's sister got sick, he and his daughter, Ruby, went to Philadelphia to care for her and never returned.<ref>[[Look Up Child]], x</ref>\n\n[[Vikram Roy]]\nAfter April had a day with several cases that made her question God and her faith, she went to the bar, where Vik came to sit next to her. The two ended up leaving together. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\nThey continued to sleep together, but with no contact during daylight. Despite this, he fell asleep at her place more than once. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nRoy took advantage of their relationship to get better opportunities at work. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\n[[Tom Koracick]]\nTom had sex with April after they met at [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie's]] game night. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")''\n\n \nShe is the second of four daughters. Her sisters are named Libby, Kimmie, and Alice.\n\n\n[[Reed Adamson]]\nBefore the shooting at Seattle Grace Mercy West, April and [[Reed Adamson]] were best friends and roommates, as well. When Reed was tragically murdered during the shooting, April was the first to find her. Finding her best friend shot to death at the hands of [[Gary Clark]] sent April into shock, but she quickly recovered and reported what she found to [[Derek Shepherd]]. April often still mentions Reed, indicating that they were very close friends.\n\n[[Charles Percy]]\nIt's unknown just how close April and Charles really were, but they were seen on several occasions laughing and joking around. April often disapproved of his crude humor, but overall seemed to get along with him.\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nWhen Lexie and April first met, Lexie found April annoying because [[Derek Shepherd]] seemed to take shine to her. Her jealousy caused her to steal April's diary and then read it. While reading the journal, she noticed tear drops on [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|Lexie & April tweeting about a surgery.]]the pages - indicating that April was crying while the notes were being written. Feeling immediately guilty, Lexie returned the diary and apologized to April.\n\nThey had another run in when [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] opened up to April about her miscarriage and not Lexie. Lexie, again became jealous and tried tricking April into annoying Meredith with her idea of a chore wheel. However, Meredith approved of the idea - much to Lexie's dismay. Lexie then blew up at April infront of Meredith - who quickly ended the confrontation and explained to Lexie that the only reason April knew about the miscarriage is because she was there when it happened. Lexie then apologized to April for treating her the way she did and gave her Izzie's room as an apology.\n\nLexie and April no longer had any negative feelings towards each other, and even developed a friendship of sorts. April even went to Lexie first for advice when [[Robert Stark]] asked her on a date.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nApril and Meredith didn't really start talking until the shooting at the hospital, when April kept her company during Derek's emergency surgery. Meredith was annoyed at April for crying during his surgery because she felt April had no right to cry, but April explained to her the reason she was crying was because her best friend, Reed had been murdered earlier that day. Meredith then held April's hand for the duration of Derek's operation.\n\nAfter the shooting, Meredith invited April to move into her home because April had been previously sharing an apartment with her deceased best friend, Reed. Meredith defended April when her peers were joking about April's virginity, and even told April she was beginning to like her when she stuck up for herself and put everyone else in their place.\n\nSince Meredith and Derek adopted [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]], April has played babysitter for her on several different occasions. Meredith is also a bridesmaid at April's wedding.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nLike he is to everyone, Alex was very rude upon meeting April, but it didn't take her long to notice this was only a defense mechanism he used to prevent people from getting too close. He continued being rude to her for quite [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|Alex showing off his scrub designed onesie to April.]]some time, but she still treated him as a friend - doing his laundry and sharing her groceries with him.\n\nWhen Robert Stark stole Alex's idea during a surgery, April defended him to the chief and made sure Alex received credit for his idea. She later met up with him in an on-call room and made sure he knew he was appreciated, and that she noticed all the good he's been doing. This prompted Alex to kiss her, but being a virgin she asked him to slow down - which frustrated him to the point that he screamed at her. He felt guilty, but left the room without saying a word.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex & April.]]\n\nApril avoided Alex for some time after that, but they reconciled over a slice of pizza on the way home from the hospital one day. When April failed her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical boards]], Alex comforted her and reassured her that hospitals would still want her regardless of not being [[Board Certification|board certified]].\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nIn April's office, she has a photo of [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] from their wedding day. She also made a onesie for baby [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] during Callie's baby shower that had a pie drawn on it accompanied by the words \"Cutie Pie\" decoratively written above. She was also seen dancing with both Callie and Arizona at their wedding reception. After April had a fight with Jackson, she came to Callie's and Arizona's house for a while.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nAfter Arizona was outed by Callie as being a cheater, April found herself relating to her in a weird way. Although April had never cheated, she did almost end things with Matthew to be with Jackson. After April overheard Callie tell everyone at the fundraiser that Arizona died in the plane crash, April took two bottles of champagne and met Arizona in the hospital storage closet to share a drink and comfort her. They soon became very open with each other and discussed their relationship problems together, bonding them. Arizona was also a bridesmaid at April's wedding. After a fight with Jackson, April came to Arizona's and Callie's house and stayed there for a few days. Arizona also comforted April after Jackson told her he wasn't going to be there if April left again.\n\nArizona was the first person to find out that April was pregnant again. She offered April drinks after she divorced Jackson. April refused and Arizona jokingly asked her if she was pregnant, to which April turned to her and replied \"According to the test I took this morning, yeah actually. I think I am.\"<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref>\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nLike many of the other doctors, Cristina found April to be somewhat annoying upon meeting her. Although April sometimes disapproved of Cristina's rule-breaking, she considered her a friend. When April was let go by the hospital for making a mistake in the ER, Cristina defended her to the other residents, claiming that everyone made mistakes that night and April was only fired because she was caught. During the race for chief resident, April and Cristina were assigned a case together and April often spoke out to Cristina about her habit of bending the rules, much to Cristina's annoyance. She was so annoyed by April's \"goody-two-shoes\" behavior that she exploded at her saying that no matter how hard she tried or how many charts she made, she would never be chief resident, but they later made up. After April failed her boards, Cristina showed kindness to her by comforting her after all of the hospitals turned her down. She even answered April's phone (pretending to be her) and told the hospitals that they were missing out because April was \"an amazing little surgeon.\" Cristina was a bridesmaid at April's wedding. After the wedding failed because April ran off with Jackson, Cristina said, \"I was on the fence about Kepner, but now I'm not only a friend, I'm a fan.\"\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\n[[File:xAprilKepner.png|thumb|left|Owen offering April her job back.]]\nAfter the shooting at the hospital, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] met with [[Richard Webber]] - the current chief of surgery to discuss a trauma training program he thought would benefit the hospital in case another emergency situation like the shooting arose. During this training, Owen was extremely impressed by April Kepner's determination and tenacity while caring for her \"dummy\" patients. He was even more so impressed when April refused to allow her patient to die, and accept the message Owen was trying to get across to the doctors - that trauma was unfair, and sometimes no matter what you do, your patients die. After the trauma training was over and all the doctors were certified, Owen mentioned to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] how proud he was, and although she didn't look like one, there was a trauma surgeon in that girl.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen comforting April.]]\n\nSince the training exercise, Owen has taken April under his wing and even comforted her before her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]] - telling her that \"she was a soldier.\" When she failed and was let go from the hospital, he flew out to Moline - her hometown and hired her back saying he should never have taken her job away from her.\n\nOn April's wedding day, Owen went through the entire hospital making sure everyone knew they had to be at the ceremony. Moments before April walked down the aisle, Owen told her she was beautiful, well-loved by the hospital, and kissed her cheek.\n\nOwen and April's friendship grew stronger during her second pregnancy when Owen consoled her as she was breaking apart from stress and fear that the pregnancy would end in another disaster. Later, she became his best man at his wedding to Amelia Shepherd, though she managed to lose the rings for a while and ended up missing the ceremony because her water broke while she and Ben were looking for the rings at Meredith's.\n\n\n\n\nApril was always top of her class in medical school and has received numerous heartfelt recommendations from her professors. During a meeting with [[Richard Webber]], he stated he has no doubt she is an excellent surgeon because she has the recommendations to prove it.\n\nApril spent most of her residency at [[Mercy West Medical Center]] but later moved to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] during the merger. When April arrived at Seattle Grace, Derek took a shine to her because she was full of intelligent and creative ideas. When [[Richard Webber]] was forced to let her go for making a mistake in the ER, Derek later rehired her because he felt she was unfairly fired and deserved a second chance. After being rehired, April decided to stick to more administrative work because she believed she wasn't a good surgeon anymore. She felt constantly guilty for losing her patient and couldn't handle any more losses. With a little encouragement from Derek, however, she finally began doing surgeries again and went on to become an excellent surgeon.\n\nApril Kepner was later chosen as Chief Resident of [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] when she impressed [[Owen Hunt]] with her patient checklist. She had a rough start, but later got a handle on things and became an excellent chief resident.\n\nHowever, nervousness got the best of her during her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]] causing her to fail. Although April was not a [[Board Certification|board-certified surgeon]] like her fellow doctors, she remained at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] as an [[Attending|attending]] [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]], with the intent of retaking her medical boards the following year, confident that she would pass the second time.\n\nIt has been noted that although the new interns refer to her as \"the dud\", she is one of their favorite surgeons and is the most willing of all her fellow attendings to teach them. Also, unlike the other doctors in the hospital, April doesn't hold grudges against the interns for making mistakes.\n\nWhen the trauma center at the hospital closed, April worked night and day with [[Derek Shepherd]] to hatch a plan to keep it open. They succeeded in receiving donations from the other departments but were devastated to find out all of their hard work was wasted. They found out the trauma center wasn't closing due to budget issues, but instead because trauma centers aren't a good selling point.\n\nWith the trauma center back in place at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], April finally feels she has her career headed in the right direction and becomes even confident that she will \"kick ass\" during her medical board exams. She did ultimately pass and become a board-certified surgeon. When Meredith was suspended, April was asked to step in as Head of General Surgery.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\nAfter surviving her near-fatal accident, April resigned from Grey Sloan and devoted herself full-time to charity clinics to provide medical care for unhoused communities in Seattle.\n\n\n*April was the first of the residents to be seen wearing navy scrubs, during the [[Hospital Shooting|hospital shooting]].\n*Growing up, April had terrible acne and wore braces and glasses until college; landing her the cruel nickname of duckie (\"the ugly duckling\") given by her sisters.\n*April took years of physical therapy as a child to correct pigeon toes (a condition in which a person's feet face inwards instead of straight ahead).\n*April watches Oprah.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref>\n*April cries at weddings.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], \ud</ref>\n*She wears contacts.\n*As a child, April had a fish tank, two hamsters, a pet pony, a pet duck, and two dogs named Buster and Pickles. Pickles was a Schnauzer. She says the pet duck lived in their house.\n*April is a bit of a photographer. She is seen taking pictures at almost every social event she and her fellow doctors attend.\n*In order to be able to communicate with the children from Alex's African program, April learned a bit of Swahili.<ref>[[White Wedding]], x</ref>\n*April used to Facebook Jackson's mother, [[Catherine Fox]], but removed her as a friend at Jackson's request.\n*She used to have a red journal with motivational messages to get her through the day, such as, \"You are the future of medicine\".\n*April was a virgin until the age of twenty-nine.\n*April lost her virginity to her ex-husband who is her longtime best friend, [[Jackson Avery]], about two years before they got married. Until [[Vikram Roy|Vik]], he was the only person she had ever had sex with.\n*When she was little, she had a pony named Sparkle.<ref>[[Adrift and at Peace]], x</ref>\n*April has fasted (abstained from any food or drink for a period of time for religious observation).\n*April has a dimple on her right cheek.\n*She is the only doctor who has been seen driving an ambulance.\n*April has had plastic surgery on her nose. It is unknown whether this was reconstructive or cosmetic.\n*April dreamed of being married in a field full of beautiful flowers with butterflies that are released when she says \"I do\" and mints that have the phrase \"mint to be\" on them but ended being married in two private ceremonies.\n*When April becomes nervous or upset, her voice becomes noticeably higher than usual. She also often waves her hands when trying to make a point.\n*According to [[Jackson Avery]] & [[Cristina Yang]], April is an excellent cook.\n*April is very talented when it comes to numbers and statistics. She even claims to become overly excited when numbers and statistics are mentioned.\n*She's the first character of whom a pregnancy that led to birth lasts for more than one season. All other pregnant characters gave birth in the same season they got pregnant in.

I'm  years old, and I was born on April rd in, in Ohio. I'm from C-Columbus. Columbus, Ohio. Um, my mom, my mom is a teacher, and m-my dad is a farmer. Corn. C-corn. He, he, he grows corn. Their, their names are Karen and Joe. [''crying harder''] I have three sisters! Libby's the oldest. I, I'm next, and then there's K-Kimmie and Alice. I, I, I haven't done anything yet. I haven't...I've barely lived! I, I'm not finished yet. No one's loved me yet. Please. Please. I'm someone's child! I'm a person! I'm a person!<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' Stop! Okay just stop. I'm a virgin, yes. So what? It's not something I talk about, okay? We all have things we don't talk about. Alex, you've been afraid of the elevator for like a month, but I never said anything because it's none of my business. And Jackson, you wake up every night screaming because you have nightmares. And, Meredith, you don't talk about Cristina because you're afraid she's never gonna be the same Cristina again. And Lexie, for God's sake, Mark never thought you were a psycho. He loves you. That's why he stares at you. Because he can't keep his eyes off the woman he loves. Of course, he's never gonna say anything cause he doesn't feel like he can. Well, we all have stuff we don't talk about! I am a -year-old virgin. Mainly because I wanted my first time to be special and then I waited too long and partially because I'm pretty sure guys find me annoying. I'm a virgin! That doesn\ut make it drinks conversation! We all have stuff we don't talk about!<ref>[[Superfreak]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' Hey, here's a question. Whatever happened to good, old-fashioned romance? No stuffing of turkeys or disinfecting sofas. But you know, what about nice, normal dates, where people talk, share a meal, get to know each other? And then wind up together. Not because they're monkeys but because they have genuine feelings in a committed way. I mean what is so wrong with that, huh?<ref>[[The Face of Change]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' I guess I have to believe that everything happens for a reason. It's all part of some plan; you\ure supposed to learn something. You lose a patient because you forget to check their airway, you don't make that mistake again. You fail your boards 'cause you're too busy sleeping with your best friend, maybe you stop doing that. The hospital you call home shuts down just when you're starting to feel like you've got your life together...<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' There's a thing we say when someone dies. We say it to the patients' family. We say, 'I'm sorry for your loss.' It's a pat little phrase and an empty one. It doesn't begin to cover what's actually happening to them. It lets us empathize without forcing us to feel their devastation ourselves. It protects us from feeling that pain, that dark, sinking, relentless pain. The kind that can eat you alive. And every day, I thank God for that. We can't get too close. If we felt even little of the joy and the hopes that our patients are saying goodbye to, we'd never be able to function. So we say, 'We're sorry for your loss.' and we hope it offers something. Some little bit of support. Some bit of peace. Some bit of closure. Something good. Some little piece of beauty in the midst of someplace dark. An unexpected gift, just when it's needed most.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' In trauma, we're concerned with one overriding question. How did this happen? What was the mechanism of injury? How do we see past the mess and confusion of trauma to figure out what the damage actually is? Infinite possibilities put the patient on the table in front of you. Now you have to figure out, will they live? Will you be able to save them or are they a lost cause? Every part of a trauma tells a different piece of the story and until you look at each and every injury, you can't see what went wrong. We talk about the mechanism of injury, about where it all started, but the truth is, it's sort of a myth. We can't boil every injury down to one single blow. What hurts us is cumulative. It happens over time. We absorb blow after blow, shock after shock, painful hit after hit. But even then, even if we know exactly how we got here, it doesn't mean we can fix it. we can't heal every wound and that's okay. I have to believe it's okay. I have to believe that even if something seems like it cannot be fixed, it doesn't mean it's broken.<ref name=\":\" />\n\n----\n:'''April:''' In the course of one day, Job received four messages, each with separate news that his livestock, servants, and  children had all died. He continued to be a faithful servant. He still prays to God. He persevered. Job's faith was tested and he passed the test. And for his faith, God rewarded Job with twice what he had before. \ucEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\ud That's what Jesus said on the cross before he died. \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" Job asked the question, too. But he kept the faith. And what did he get for it? Replacement children. PTSD. Was it worth it to have been a faithful servant? Or would it have been better to just curse God's name from the beginning? Where was God throughout all of Job's suffering and pain? He was winning a bet with Satan. It makes you wonder where He is through all of the unfairness and inequity and cruelty in the world.

When they were in preschool, it was who brought home the best finger painting. When they were nine, it was who could assemble the Lego castle the fastest. In high school, it was who could get a date to the prom first, and upon graduating, it was who could get into the better college. They both ended up going to U-Dub. After opening their own bars, the competition was whose bar was the most successful, which has been going on ever since. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nJoe was at the bar the night Derek and Meredith met. He served them their drinks and watched as they talked. ''(\"[[Time Has Come Today]]\")''\n\n\nJoe collapsed one day on the floor of his bar. He walked across the street to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a basal artery aneurysm. To clip the aneurysm, Derek and Burke planned a stand-still surgery. Joe didn't want the surgery because he was concerned about the cost. He feared he would not be able to keep his bar which was his life. Joe had had his bar for fourteen years. Luckily, [[George O'Malley]] was able to convince the Chief to have Joe's surgery funded by donating his body to science and qualifying him for a research grant since he would be briefly \"dead\", allowing him to keep the bar. ''(\"[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\")''\n\n\nAfter confessing her love to Derek and asking him to choose her, Meredith went to the bar and asked Joe if he believed Derek would pick her. He was sure Derek would pick her. ''(\"[[Bring the Pain]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith waited for Derek and got progressively more drunk, the news of a train crash caused all the doctors to get paged. Joe turned on the news so they could see what had happened. He tried to convince Meredith to stay for a cup of coffee before going to the hospital. Shortly after she left, Derek walked in and Joe broke the news that Meredith had left. ''(\"[[Into You Like a Train]]\")''\n\n\nJoe watched as Cristina and Izzie counted up the money they'd made selling tickets to Shane's surgery. ''(\"[[Something to Talk About]]\")''\n\n\nJoe attending Thanksgiving dinner at [[Meredith's House]]. He brought along his boyfriend, [[Walter]], whom the doctors had not previously met. He also brought a pie to share. He and Walter stayed despite most of the guests not showing up on time, but eventually had to leave before they came because he had to open the bar. ''(\"[[Thanks for the Memories]]\")''\n\n\nAfter a long day of surgery, Derek came to the bar, where Joe poured him a drink without even asking what he wanted. ''(\"[[Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the residents were at the bar comparing stories to see who was having the worst day, Joe observed and prompted Izzie when it was her turn. He then had to break up a fight that occurred when [[Nurse Kate]] poured a drink on [[Cristina Yang]]. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nAfter visiting her father, Meredith ended up at Joe's to get a drink. Mark came in and sat down next to her. ''(\"[[Yesterday]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was trying to be celibate, she came to Joe's, but didn't drink. Instead, she was knitting a sweater. Joe said that she was scaring the customers by knitting. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the interns were at the bar, Izzie and Alex exchanged insults. When Izzie called Alex a gynecologist disparagingly, Joe laughed. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie baked muffins to cope with Denny's death, she brought two baskets of them to the bar for Joe. Addison ate one basket of muffins while she got drunk and at the end of the day, Joe called Addison a cab per her instructions. ''(\"[[I Am a Tree]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie came into the bar to meet with [[Dennison Duquette, Sr.|Denny's father]], Joe pointed him out to her. ''(\"[[What I Am]]\")''\n\n\nJoe and Walter went on a camping trip with several of the male doctors. During the camping trip, he discussed his relationship with Walter with Richard Webber and they bonded over some similarities. Later, when Walter was injured, Joe held his hand while he got stitches. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\n\nAfter George's dad died, Alex went to the bar. Joe asked him about Harold and Alex informed him that Harold had died. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nwhen Meredith drowned in [[Elliott Bay]], Cristina left the hospital and went to the dollar store and then to the bar, where she talked to Joe as she got drunk, thinking Meredith would die. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nJoe and Walter decided to have kids and put in an application to adopt. They met up with [[Rina]], who was deciding between them and another couple to adopt her baby. They took her to get prenatal care because she hadn't had any and an ultrasound revealed twins. Later, while Walter was taking her to the bus station, Rina started having severe chest pain, so he brought her back to the bar, where she collapsed and was taken back to the ER. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nIn the ER, [[Preston Burke]] took over her care and said she'd need surgery for an aortic dissection, which meant the babies would probably be born that day. They took her into the OR, where the babies were quickly delivered and Burke repaired her heart. After her surgery, she was stable and awake. Walter and Joe sat by her bedside as they held their newborn twins. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nAs part of Callie and Mark's pact not to sleep with any interns, they agreed to sit at the bar and stare at Joe, which freaked Joe out. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Archer Montgomery|Archer's]] surgery was successful, Addison, Sam, Naomi, Mark, and Derek came to the bar to celebrate. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\nWhen their celebrating continued into the next morning, Joe pointed that out to them. ''(\"[[Ex-Life]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the stress of the merger, Richard started drinking again and Joe served him. ''(\"[[New History]]\")''\n\nWhen Richard became drunk on New Year's Day, Joe called Meredith to come take care of him. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n\nJoe was present when a camera crew filmed a documentary about the doctors at the hospital. He gave interviews on his point of view of the doctors. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Cristina quit her residency, Owen told her to get a job, so she went to work at the bar. Joe quickly became frustrated with her as she was a terrible bartender. He ultimately fired her. ''(\"[[Slow Night, So Long]]\")''\n\n\nHe enjoys listening to other people's problems, keeping the peace, breaking up fights over games of pool and darts, babysitting drunk employees of Seattle Grace, controlling the flow of alcohol as well as the TV remote. He also enjoys movies, television, exercising (in small doses), and almost any outdoor activity.\n\nJoe is very friendly to his customers, one of the many reasons many of the hospital staff go there.\n\n\n\n[[Walter]]\nOn a camping trip, Joe revealed during a discussion with the Chief that although he and [[Walter]] had been \"on-and-off\" for about ten years, they were now committed and considering the possibility of children, but Walter said he didn't want to raise kids alone because Joe was always working at the bar. However, Joe said that he loved Walter so much that if he needed to make a change, he would. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\nThey were one of two couples being considered as adoptive parents for a young mother's twins.\n\nJoe and [[Walter]] also attended the Thanksgiving [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] hosted at [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] house, and went on a camping trip with Drs. [[Derek Shepherd|Shepherd]], [[Preston Burke|Burke]], [[Richard Webber|Webber]], [[Alex Karev|Karev]] and [[George O'Malley|O'Malley]].\n\nMax\nHe dated a guy named Max for about four weeks. Prior to that, they were friends. Things ended when Joe made the mistake of talking about a hot lifeguard in front of Max. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nHe has a nephew and a niece named Samantha. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\nHe is close with his mother, who lives just down the street from him. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nJoe gets along well with most of the doctors from the hospital across the street from his bar.\n\n[[Debbie]]\nHe and Debbie are best friends. During the first annual Emerald City Bar Darts Tournament, Joe's partner flaked on him, and Debbie volunteered to be his partner. Her dart skills brought her and Joe up to semifinals, where they lost. Joe congratulated Debbie on her dart skills and she thanked him for taking her mind off work. While munching on peanuts, they began to gossip about people they both know. Joe likes to say that they bonded over darts, but Debbie says that they share a common love for gossip. They have been best friends ever since.\ua''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\nEric\nHe has a friend named Eric who sustained a head injury from the [[Dead Baby Bike Race]]. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nWhen Bailey was an intern, she spent a lot of time in the bar talking to Joe. He told her she was worth something, not that he knew anything about it. He gave her confidence. She described him as the only one who really knew her at the time.\ua''(\"[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\")'' ''(\"[[The Time Warp]]\")''\n\n\nBefore befriending the other interns of his class, Alex hung out at the bar a lot with Joe becoming his only friend.\n\n\nHe owns and runs [[Emerald City Bar]], which is across the street from [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He's owned the bar for over  years.\n\n\n*He has an official blog, [http://www.emeraldcitybar.com/]\n*He is  years old.<ref>[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]</ref>\n*He minored in German in college.<ref>[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]</ref>\n*His favorite drink is the Irish Car Bomb.

''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\n\nMabel participated in a skills lab at Grey Sloan. During the lab, she corrected [[Zander Perez]] on something and got Richard to back her up, though they both noticed he didn't seem enthused to be working with them. He later sent them all home early. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\nLater, Mabel did another skills lab with the other residents, though they didn't take it seriously. That same day, she also rounded on [[Ava Gutierrez]] with Richard Webber. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\n\nMabel was among the medical staff in the gallery watching Richard's explantation and hip replacement. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a shipment of PPE arrived at the hospital, which they expected to contain masks and gloves, Tom assigned Mabel and Taryn to guard it as they opened it. However, when thy opened the boxes, they learned it was all booties and no masks. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nMabel was briefly on Meredith's case after she was diagnosed with Covid- before a new rule was implemented disallowing interns and residents to work on any patients with Covid or suspected Covid. Later, while waiting in line to be tested for Covid, Mabel was pulled out of line to teach [[Sara Ortiz]] the proper way to don and doff PPE after Owen noticed she was not wearing it properly. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Dave Oyadomari]] came back into the ER after falling off a stepladder and injuring himself, Mabel ended up on the case. Due to his being Asian, she quickly realized he'd been misdiagnosed with appendicitis due to a prior ER visit and instead had right-sided diverticulitis, which had perforated after he was sent home. Owen allowed her to scrub in due to her catching the correct diagnosis. After Dave's surgery, Mabel went to talk to Owen about how his medical care, which was centered on European norms, had led to Dave being seriously injured, causing him a month off work that would otherwise have been avoided. However, before she could confront him, Nico sent her out of the room, having previously advised her not to risk her residency over it. Instead, he confronted Owen himself. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Tad (Station )|Tad]] was shot in the head with an arrow, Mabel greeted the aid car in the ambulance bay. When she saw they'd rigged a hammock in the aid car to hold his head up as it couldn't rest flat on the gurney, she called it genius. She told the firefighters that she had trauma and neurosurgery waiting for him. ''(\"[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Chad Anderson]] was brought to the ER with COVID symptoms after collapsing while jogging, Mabel treated him in the ER, though he mistook her for a nurse. Later, when Chad signed himself out against medical advice, Mabel treated him again just outside the hospital when he collapsed again. He died shortly afterward. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them  seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total,  patients were treated using this method. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nThe residents enjoyed this new teaching method and eagerly awaited each day. Mabel did an echo on Vic Hughes's heart after she was electrocuted at a scene. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nMabel and Levi went to a recruitment fair, where they explained The Webber Method and how it allowed the residents to get more experience and treat more patients in less time. The medical students were confused by their explanation and failed to understand how it was better than other programs. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\nMabel was assigned to work on a heart transplant. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhen The Webber Method resulted in the death of [[Devon Gomez]], Mabel attended an M&M conference to determine how they could prevent it from happening again. After the conference, Mabel worked with Amelia on [[Francesca Lyons]], who had severe lower back pain which was eventually attributed to endometriosis. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Levi quit, the other residents were only getting assigned simple procedures, which they considered a form of punishment. When Richard didn't show up for work, they questioned what they were supposed to do. Meredith, who was operating on [[David Hamilton]] that day, went to Hamilton and asked if she could use his surgery as a teaching opportunity and allow all hospital staff to observe. The residents were eager to be part of this. Before the surgery started, Meredith explained what they were doing and gave them time to ask questions. The surgery then proceeded and went well. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nMabel worked on the case of [[Laura Eames]], who was  weeks pregnant with mitral valve insufficiency. She scrubbed in on Laura's surgery. While they were workin on Laura, they talked about Laura trying to set her brother up with Jo. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the residents learned that [[Fernanda Lima|Fernanda Lima's]] surgery had been changed from a Ross Procedure to a Ross-Konno Procedure, they were eager to watch it. However, Owen came to them and told them to go see patients to help cover the physician shortage. Specifically, he said that Mabel was supposed to be covering the ICU and hadn't turned in her monthly case load report. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nMabel and the other residents were called to do grand rounds with [[Nick Marsh]] and [[Meredith Grey]]. They arrived to find Nick with the patient, Mason Taylor, who was brain dead after being struck by a drunk driver. His wife wanted to donate his organs, but UNOS rejected them, so she donated his body for research. Nick explained that they would be transplanting a genetically modified pig kidney into Mason's body in the hopes that they could perfect the technology, which would eliminate the wait for donor organs. He transplanted the kidney near the groin so they had better blood supply and could see the kidney as they waited to see if it would work. After the surgery, they celebrated that the kidney was producing urine. When the kidney later stopped working, Nick had them do a biopsy and sent the residents away to avoid screaming at them. Then he did everything he could to save the kidney, but started to lose faith. Meredith suggested using epinephrine, which worked and Jordan reported that the kidney was working again. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Mabel learned that [[Alice Tom]] was bring treated at the hospital after being attacked at a bus stop for being Asian-American, she decided to stay at the hospital to watch her surgery instead of going home. While she watched, she told Levi that no one stopped to help Alice or call for help or even record the attack. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nMabel was working the day [[Jamarah Blake]] returned to the hospital to evaluate the residency program. She donated blood that day in an attempt to help lessen the burden of the blood shortage. Then she watched Meredith and Nick attempt to remove [[Cora|Cora's]] pancreatic tumor in an ex-vivo surgery. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\nShe later helped the other residents get the word out on social media that the hospital needed blood, drawing in several donors. At the end of the day, when the surgical residency program was shut down, she packed up her things. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\n\nHer grandparents were sent to an interment camp at Jerome. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nShe's a second-year [[Resident|resident]]. She was working at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]]. When it was purchased, she came over to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to interview to keep her job. She was hired at Grey Sloan.\n\n\n*She is Gosei on her mother's side.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxMabelTseng.png|[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[A Diagnosis]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[Snowblind]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[My Happy Ending]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\nSxMabelTseng.png|[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[Sign O' the Times]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[Hotter Than Hell]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[Out for Blood]]\nxMabelTseng.png|[[You Are the Blood]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Mabel Tseng Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tseng, Mabel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Her mother was busy talking to a friend about a block party. She turned around and her child was missing.\n\n\nHolly was held by her captor in the basement of a house for  years. She was raped many times and abused when she acted like she didn't like it. At some point while she was held captive, she became pregnant. She broke her pelvis as she delivered the baby, who later died. She tried to escape before, but assumed that her parents would no longer want her so she turned around and went back. The reason she left the final time, twelve years after being kidnapped, was because her captor told her she was used up and that he was going to get another girl.\n\n\nHolly was found by hikers in the woods and then brought to the hospital. The original assumption was that she was a lost hiker, but when Meredith saw signs that she had been imprisoned somewhere, she figured out that Holly had been kidnapped and asked Holly for her name.\n\nHer scans revealed multiple injuries, including older ones which hadn't healed properly. While she was in surgery, they connected the name she gave them to a missing person who was kidnapped at age six. A birth mark on one arm positively identified her as Holly Wheeler.\n\nHolly quickly bonded with Meredith after being brought to the hospital. She looked to Meredith for support when the police asked her questions and when her parents came to see her.\n\nHolly's parents brought pictures and a stuffed bunny from their home. Meredith reviewed them with her until she confessed that she remembered all of it, the memories of them and the memories of her captivity. Meredith lied to the parents and said that Holly didn't remember the stuff they brought.\n\nHolly had multiple surgeries after that, to repair the old fractures that never healed properly. She started to talk more in therapy, but refused to talk to her parents. She also hid two granola bars under her bed.\n\nCallie discovered an avulsion fracture which she determined to be quite old. It hadn't healed properly. When she asked Holly about it, she said it probably happened when she had the baby, because she couldn't walk for a while afterward. Her parents were horrified to hear that she'd had a baby who eventually died.\n\nAs part of her recovery, Meredith had to take her to the cafeteria and have her get her own food. She avoided talking to anyone and only got desserts from the self-serve station so she didn't have to talk to anyone.\n\nAfter that, she expressed to Meredith a desire to talk about her life while she was captive, as she felt that they didn't want to hear it because there were good parts to it and it was her reality for  years. She allowed Holly to talk about it, even how she missed him and how she's not always happy to be at the hospital instead of in his basement. Meredith said that it was okay for her to feel that way.\n\nHolly was taken into emergency surgery when her celiac artery graft began to leak, which led to cardiac arrest.\n\nTwelve days later, the doctors had a meeting where they discussed Holly's condition and they all cleared her to go home with her parents.\n\nMeredith talked to her before she left, saying that her parents are good parents and she should try talking to them the way she talked to Meredith. She decided to speak up and ask them to leave the stuffed bunny rabbit because it reminded her of what she missed out on. They agreed and took her home.\n\n\n\nHolly's parents came to the hospital every day while she was staying there, even though they were only allowed to see her one supervised hour per day. They brought pictures and items from their house to remind her of her life before her captivity.\n\n\n*At the hospital, she connected with [[Meredith Grey]] during her stay.\n*Joseph Ingles called her Susan.\n*She got a stuffed bunny for her sixth birthday.\n*She was  years old when she re-surfaced after being held captive for  years.\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.png\nx-.png\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:Holly Wheeler]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wheeler, Holly}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He is roommates with [[Taryn Helm]]. He is the ex-boyfriend of [[Nico Kim]].\n\n\n\nWhen Levi was a child, he was determined to be first in line to get a comic book, but on the way, a block from the store, he flipped over the handlebars of his bike and broke both his arms.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi was selected to be part of a group of [[Clerkship|\"sub-i's\" doing a rotation]] at Grey Sloan Memorial as a sort of extended interview to attempt to get an [[Internship|internship]] there. On his first day, he was observing a surgery when he leaned over the body cavity and his glasses fell in. Later, Levi went to apologize to Jo about what he'd done. She told him to buy contacts, which he said he'd already done, and the two ended up going back to Levi's mom's basement to have sex.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day at work, he returned her name tag, which she'd left there accidentally. He and the other sub-interns were challenged to find a suitable abdominal wall donor for Megan. He found a good donor, but didn't know how to approach the family about it. He went to Jo, who took over the case and got to scrub in on the surgery as a result.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi later returned to the hospital for an official interview for an internship with [[Richard Webber|Drs. Webber]] and [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]]. During the interview, he revealed that he tried wearing contacts to keep his glasses from falling off his face, but he didn't like touching his own eyeball, so he instead started using a band to keep his glasses on his face.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nLevi attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a roller coaster derailed at a fair, Levi tended to [[Cleo Kim]], who was trapped in the roller coaster car. He struggled with suctioning properly while April and Meredith operated.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nLevi scrubbed in on surgery on [[Judy Kemp]], who needed a splenectomy. When Meredith determined she needed blood and wasn't able to access it because of the hospital hack, she asked who in the OR had an appropriate blood type. Levi raised his hand and he was hooked up to do a direct transfusion to Judy.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref>\n\nLevi started to feel faint due to blood loss and Meredith asked someone to get him a basin to vomit in. He tried to get it himself and passed out on the floor. He was given saline to recover. After he woke up, Judy asked to see him. She thanked him for saving her life and told him to be proud of it and stand up straight. <ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was called to Bailey's house to help her with something. He became disturbed at the things she asked him to retrieve and when she told him to take off his scrubs before coming the next time, prompting him to stand up for himself and say he didn't feel safe with what was happening. She then told him she wasn't trying to seduce him. She was working on the prototype for her surgical contest entry.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nAfter overhearing Maggie, Amelia, and Meredith planning a game night, Levi showed up with Taryn. Maggie just shut the door in their faces.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Dayna Rutledge]] came into the ER after a car accident and told the doctors about her recent cancer diagnosis and promise of a good outcome, Levi was impressed with her oncologist. However, Owen told him never to promise anything like that to patients or Owen would end his career.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Arizona became worried about [[Lanie]] while she was giving birth, she asked Levi to get a cart together with everything they might need. He found an old cart and stocked it with supplies, but when Arizona looked at it, she noted that he'd put things in all the wrong places and rearranged them based on their use. Lanie's birth went smoothly, but they later used the cart when another new mom hemorrhaged.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was in the OR with Bailey when she started to feel the effects of the weed cookie she'd ingested. He stayed to assist Jo as she operated in Bailey's place and retrieved Richard's cancer pen so she could determine exactly where the cancer stopped in order to save part of his stomach.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nLevi helped Jo with [[Milo Jankovic]], who had swallowed a chew toy and was whistling when he breathed. Once they located the whistle, he did the bronchoscopy with Alex's guidance to remove it.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Vik sued the hospital for wrongful termination, Bailey and Richard went to Levi to ask him if he'd ever seen anything to indicate that Vik was incompetent. Levi said he had, but also shared an unhelpful account of Bailey when she was high.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nAfter April was in a car accident and came to the hospital hypothermic, Levi and the other interns took shifts with the attendings doing CPR.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Levi was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding due to a faulty GPS link on the invitation April had sent out. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. Despite a series of delays, Jo and Alex eventually got married on the ferry, witnessed by their friends.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi helped treat [[Nisha]] after she was hit by a car.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> The night after her surgery, he was with her when she spiked a fever post-op. When tests showed that the infection she had was necrotizing fasciitis, he went along with the team into the hyperbaric chamber to debride her wound. After Nisha died, he had to wait along with the others for the chamber to decompress before they could leave. After leaving work, he went to the bar, where [[Nico Kim|Nico]] bought him a beer.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Dave Buckley]] came into the ER after having mysteriously collapsed and nearly severing two fingers with a table saw, Levi delivered the news that his blood alcohol content was higher than he thought it could get.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia brought Betty into the hospital one day and asked Levi for a drug test for Betty. Levi misunderstood and brought Amelia a sample of his own urine. She sent him away to try again.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] took a personal day last-minute, Webber told Taryn and Schmitt that they were to report to Andrew and remember to provide patients the best level of care. They helped Andrew treat a man with lacerations and Levi had trouble with a cut on his forehead. Levi struggled, so Andrew gave him a pointer. Later, when [[Molly Graham]] stopped breathing, Andrew had to intubate and brushed off the interns' help, which Richard disapproved of.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nLevi worked on the case of [[J.J. Williams]], who broke his arm trying to climb a fence. His arm was broken, which they confirmed with an x-ray. However, the x-ray also showed a mass, which a biopsy confirmed was cancerous. They told him and his mother and J.J. was worried about going bald, prompting Link to cut his own hair and let J.J. help him.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the wind storm, Levi was sent to the clinic with Nico to clear it of patients. He and Nico argued over a patient as they worked, but Levi insisted he could handle it because he had experience. After taking a patient to peds, Nico came back to make sure Levi got back okay. After Levi said he'd wait it out in the clinic, Nico went to leave and got swept away as soon as he took one step outside. Levi crawled to him and then helped him get into a nearby ambulance. In the ambulance, Levi said he didn't know he was gay when he was young because he didn't have opportunity to explore the feelings he had. After his speech, Nico kissed him again. Then they had sex in the ambulance.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the storm had calmed somewhat, they were startled when Alex came into the ambulance to escape the wind as they were getting dressed. They worried they'd be fired. Levi helped while Link and Jackson operated on [[Jed Lundberg]], who had had his legs crushed by the elevator, and found a way to let him keep both his legs. After his surgery, Jed had nerve function in his foot, which was a sign the surgery worked. At the end of the day, Alex told them what they did was unacceptable and instructed them to use rooms with locks in the future.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Owen was accidentally injected with a sedative during [[Claire Conway|Claire Conway's]] surgery, Levi intubated him and moved him to a room, where he continued to monitor Owen and give him fluids until the sedative wore off. He then extubated Owen. This incident inspired him to start wearing contacts instead of glasses so he could look as confident as he felt, though he needed Taryn's help to put them in.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nLevi started his ICU rotation while [[Natasha Deon]] was in the ICU after her accident. Every day, he examined her and gave report on her condition. When she needed surgery, he scrubbed in to assist. After she and Garrett decided to have her ventilator turned off, Levi was present at their last-minute wedding and her death.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nLevi worked on the case of [[Kimberly Thompson]]. He was engaged in the drama between her and Maggie, whom she had bullied in medical school.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nLevi worked with Nico to prepare for an upcoming hip replacement, but when a mass overdose brought a flood of patients to the ER, the surgery was rescheduled and Levi and Nico instead operated on a patient who had had a drug overdose and fell, which broke both her arms.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was on the case of [[Hunter Martinez]], but was removed from the case when Jo asked to be put on the surgery. Levi was upset, because he knew Jo was getting preferential treatment, but then she pointed out that he was only on the case himself because of Nico.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nLevi helped treat [[Douglas Hall]], who came into the ER after a car accident with his wife. He had fractures to his clavicle and humerus, but was otherwise okay. Jackson was treating Rick, who had been burned over a large portion of his body. He decided to use fish skin to graft the burns and had the interns skin the fish. When Richard learned the rest of the fish was being put in medical waste, he decided to host a fish fry and invited the interns.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Maggie introduced the new mood rooms, Levi waited in one to take Bailey's blood pressure after she played tetris. However, they were all called away by Dahlia, who wanted help competing in math problems against [[Nora Hillridge]].<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nLevi helped with the case of [[Caleb Hicks]], who was at the hospital for an abdominal wall, penis, and scrotum transplant.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nLevi assisted on [[Josh Sterman|Josh Sterman's]] surgery. When Nico made an error, Josh collapsed after surgery and died in the OR as Maggie tried to repair the damage. Nico snapped at Levi when Levi tried to console him.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nWhile at a flower shop to buy flowers for Nico, Levi met and talked to [[Lucas Ripley]].<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> When he was leaving the flower shop, he saw that Ripley had collapsed on the sidewalk and he stepped in to help. He rode with Ripley to the hospital, where he was identified. Levi hailed himself a hero for saving the Fire Chief. He tried to share his success with Nico, but Nico responded coldly to him. Levi continued to press him, but stopped when Link said what Nico was going through is unlike anything else and he needs to be allowed to process it on his own.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref> After learning that Ripley had died, Levi purchased the same flowers he'd bought for Vic and came to the station on the day of the funeral to talk to her and explain to her what Ripley hoped to say with the flowers.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAt some point, he was rounding on [[Gabriella Rivera]] in peds and read \"Ellis Grey\" on her wristband, which confused him as he had heard [[Luis Rivera|Luis]] call her Gabby. He thought the name on the wristband was a mistake and went to look for Meredith to question her about it, but she wasn't at work that day. Since he felt like he couldn't afford to make another mistake, he went to Bailey instead, which led to Meredith's insurance fraud being discovered and her subsequent firing along with Richard and Alex.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Frances Pinfield]] came to the US to donate blood to [[Gus Carter]], Levi went to meet her at the airport, but reported that Frances was struggling just to get off the plane. With Owen's help, they were able to get her to the car, but on the way to the hospital, a fog settled in and they were stuck in traffic and accidents.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAfter things settled, they left the car. Owen said he'd carry Frances to a nearby ambulance, which they'd use to get to the hospital. Owen was able to convince the paramedics to go along with this by treating the patient they were working on. At the hospital, Levi brought Frances juice and cookies while her blood was extracted.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nNico and Levi's relationship remained stable after their reconciliation. Levi worked on [[Jai Prishna]] at work. While he started out as a miracle case, he slipped into an inexplicable coma, which made Levi's body ache. Nico comforted him. After a few weeks, Levi was about to extubate Jai per his wife's request, but Amelia and Link saved the day by diagnosing fat embolism syndrome. They started an experimental protocol, which proved successful after a few more weeks.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nWhile the rest of the residents got pulled into Bailey's skills lab, Levi was contacted by Meredith to bring her supplies so she could organize a street clinic for her work crew. He arrived with the supplies and shared he felt like he was going to get arrested for stealing from the hospital. She quipped she owned the hospital and that he was therefore just bringing her her own stuff. He later joined her as she brought [[Robin (Season )|Robin]] to Grey Sloan's parking lot for an ultrasound and asked Jackson to perform a biopsy. Levi assisted Jackson during the autopsy and told him that he was a Gryffindor, so he felt brave when he complied with Meredith's request, but he was scared that Bailey would find out and fire him. Jackson, a Gryffindor too, promised he would cover for him if she were to find out because he was not afraid of getting in trouble if it meant that Meredith could help people.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nUnder Andrew's supervision, Levi let a catheter guide wire slip into the patient's body. They had to perform an emergency procedure in the cath lab to retrieve it. An angry Bailey appeared while they were doing so and demanded a full report. Levi was surprised that she seemed to aim her anger at Andrew. After the patient was saved, Andrew told him Bailey knew full well that Levi had made the mistake but it happened under his supervision and therefore, it was his responsibility. However, Andrew said it was his responsibility to talk to the patient and his daughter, which Levi did very clumsily by explaining how the procedure should have gone and where he went wrong. Additionally, Andrew ordered him to hold onto a guide wire for another week. When Nico learned of his mistake, he told Levi to demand more of himself and took him to the skills lab to practice until he got it right.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith's article was published as an attack on Grey Sloan, [[Blake Simms]] teased the other residents that they would have a hard time finding work elsewhere in the future. Levi's mother found the article and sent it to his entire family. His aunt Carol wanted to reschedule her carpal tunnel surgery to another hospital but Levi called his mother to assure her that Grey Sloan was still a good hospital. Andrew interrupted his call to tell him to get to work as he was contributing to issues touched upon in Meredith's article by making private calls instead of working. Levi assisted Jackson during the surgery on [[Clervie Martin]]. Jackson had worked hard to prevent Tom from using the surgery as a free positive press in order to protect Clervie's parents. However, after seeing the amazing results, Levi admitted he regretted Jackson's decision because the positive publicity would have helped Grey Sloan's reputation and in extension his career, which wasn't as established as Jackson's. His comment rubbed Jackson the wrong way.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was excited when [[Carly Davis]] had to be treated inside the hyperbaric chamber, finally giving him the opportunity to experience it, but Jo inserted herself into the case, meaning Levi was out.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nLevi and Nico planned a Capitol Hill trip for Halloween. His mother asked him not to share any pictures of the trip on social media as his family might see but he didn't want to hide his being gay from them. When Jackson found out there wasn't going to be a Halloween parade on the peds floor since Alex was gone, he instructed Levi to organize it, disrupting his plans to leave early. While Levi was rushing to decorate the peds floor, a kid came up and asked him to help him find a costume. Levi brought in all the costumes he could find but the boy rejected all of them and expressed his desire to be a sunflower. Levi then devoted himself to make sunflower costumes out of trauma gowns. He ditched his Dungeons & Dragons paladin costume for his own sunflower costume. Levi and Taryn attended the parade and Nico surprised Levi by showing up, too. Levi took a selfie of the two of them in their costumes and shared it on social media, saying happiness should be shared.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was called as a witness for Meredith's hearing with the medical commission. He forgot his tie so Nico gave him his lucky tie from his locker. While being questioned, he nervously expressed how good of a teacher Meredith was as she never partook in mean nicknames and made him save a patient by having him act as a human blood bank during surgery. Eventually, he had to confess to the entire room that he was the one who had brought up the fraud to Bailey. He profoundly apologized to Meredith and explained he had thought the false name on the wristband was an error and had felt like he couldn't afford to make another mistake. He broke down and ran out of the room as soon as the prosecutor was done with him. He returned to the hospital to work. [[Blake Simms]] had somehow found out and shared with the entire group of residents that Levi had been the one to rat out Meredith, making him persona non grata.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nThe other residents continued to be mean to him so he sought comfort in Nico's companionship. While they were making out one morning, Nico made him leave for rounds, promising a reward later. He joined the other residents for rounds while they were eating Meredith's welcome back cake. He didn't get a piece. Levi defended himself by saying he was just doing his job, which Blake likened to the Nazis' excuse. Levi didn't like that as his great-grandfather had been in a concentration camp. Hannah made Blake apologize but insisted Levi was still a traitor. While bringing [[Elliott Calhoun]] up to surgery, Levi told Taryn she couldn't be mad at him forever. They started arguing until Elliott broke it up and asked them to make a detour to the NICU so he could see his son before surgery. The surgery went well but Elliott's heart didn't restart, most likely due to hibernating myocardium. Levi and Nico went to the bar to de-stress after Levi's awful day. Nico wanted to get dinner first but Levi was eager for dessert. Levi went to get them some more drinks when a car suddenly crashed into the bar.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Levi has to help his injured friends.]]\nLevi was the only resident uninjured. Ben and Nico snapped him out of his daze to get him to help out. Levi was tasked with keeping Blake stabilized and prevent him from choking on the blood originating from his mid-facial fracture. Levi started to panic that Taryn and Blake would die, but Jackson reassured him that wouldn't happen. Station 's crew then managed to get into the bar and all injured people were transported to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where Levi also went to help out.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\nHe hid in a supply closet and cried. Bailey found him there and convinced him that their friends needed help, so she got him up and he sprung into action. Bailey took him to Taryn and assigned him to the case. He assisted Meredith as she put in an IVC filter. An inebriated Taryn then said she didn't want Levi working on her as he was the reason the love of her life had been fired. As Meredith asked Levi to go back to the ER with her, Levi collapsed. Meredith did a full work-up and found an elevation of cardiac enzymes, which could indicate a heart attack. She asked if there was someone she could call for him but he said his mother would only panic, Nico was working, and Taryn hated him, so there was no one. Meredith then paged Teddy, who performed an angio as Meredith sat by Levi's side. He told her was so sorry for reporting her and she told him she had forgiven him since it all worked out. Teddy then diagnosed broken-heart syndrome caused by the extreme stress of the accident. He was put in a patient's room to rest and woke up with Nico by his side. Nico informed him Taryn made it through surgery and climbed into bed with him. Later, Nico took him to visit Taryn, who stopped him as he apologized and said she needed her best friend to get through this. They then talked about her confessing her love for Meredith.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref> Levi was soon discharged and given a couple of weeks of medical leave.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi's mother interrupted Levi and Nico to inform him that his favorite uncle Saul, whom she didn't like, was dying in his retirement home. Levi rushed over to be able to say goodbye, bringing Nico with him. Levi asked about his aunt Gertie, whom Saul said would arrive when she could. He then asked about Levi still living with his mother. Levi explained his mother had learned something about him and had asked him to keep it private. He then came out by introducing Nico as his boyfriend, at which point Saul flatlined and passed away. Despite being only culturally Jewish, Levi wanted to honor the tradition of not leaving the body of the deceased unattended. When Gertie arrived, he thought she came to relieve him, but she left after briefly sobbing over Saul's body, only stating that she and Saul promised each other that the end was the end. Levi and Nico were forced to stay. As they were playing cards, an unknown man came in and broke down over Saul's body. Daniel revealed he was Saul's lover. Saul had told him all about Levi, including the fact that he thought Levi was gay, like him. Daniel explained that Myrna and Saul didn't get along because she bought into the homophobia taught to her by her parents. Daniel then offered Levi to prepare Saul's body together. As they did so, Levi inquired why Saul chose to live a fake life with Gertie. Daniel pointed out the difference between their generations, with Levi's generation taking for granted what is possible now. As Levi vowed to never do that again, Daniel said he thought it had been Saul's plan for Levi to be there at the end to make sure Levi would give himself the freedom that Saul had not allowed himself to have. They recited a psalm and covered up the body.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Levi tells his mom he is moving out.]]\nBack home, Levi and Nico started packing. Myrna barely responded to Saul's passing, angering Levi. He said he was super gay and that her response meant that she wasn't truly accepting him. Myrna lashed out at Nico, thinking he had put Levi up to this, but Nico assured her it was all him, even though he agreed with every word. Levi then thanked his mother for having taken care of him and officially announced that he was moving out. He and Nico then left.<ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Levi and Nico watch the dancing couple.]]\nLevi temporarily moved in with Nico, which he loved. On Levi's first day back at work, Levi noticed that Nico was subtly encouraging him to find his own place. Nico explained they weren't at the cohabitating step just yet. Levi and Meredith diagnosed abdominal metastases in a woman who was in Seattle for a ballroom dancing championship. They initiated palliative care. The woman's husband approached Levi, whom reminded him of his kind and gentle grandson, and asked him for a favor. Levi gathered the other residents and they improvised a ballroom setting in the cafeteria to allow the couple to have one final dance. Afterword, an emotional Levi took Irene back to her room. She told him not to cry because she had had a beautiful life and got to end it with the love of her life by her side. She asked him if he had found his, which he didn't reply to. As they were making out in an on-call room, Levi cautiously told Nico that he wanted a love like Irene and Norman's, but Nico brushed off the comment.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nAs Nico found Levi apartment hunting, he once again refused to let Levi live with him. Levi invited him to come check out an apartment with him that night, but Nico said he had to meet his parents. He didn't want Levi to come, stating that they were super critical and had impossibly high standards. After successfully convincing [[Joey Phillips]] to do his PT, Levi built up the courage to once again ask Nico to introduce him to his parents. Nico repeated his earlier statement. Levi replied he knew how to take criticism. Nico then revealed that he hadn't come out to his parents. Levi was baffled giving Nico's reaction to Levi's first experiences as a gay man. Nico was aware of that but he brushed it off and left to meet his parents.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> They stopped talking with each other afterward as Nico only appeared interested in having sex. After a stressful day, Nico found him in an on-call room and wanted to have sex, but Levi stopped him and said he wanted more. Nico got angry and said he couldn't just talk about his feelings. He said they should end things if Levi couldn't handle that. Levi then gave in, saying he accepted that, and they proceeded to make out.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOn Meredith's pro bono surgery day, Levi invited Taryn to come to a speakeasy that night with him and Nico. Taryn said she wasn't in the mood to see Levi fawning over Nico because of how good the sex was despite Nico not treating Levi as an equal in their relationship. The two of them then overheard Nico thanking Link for setting up an interview for him for Link's old job with the Mariners. Nico briefly told Levi the opportunity was too good to pass up. As he headed into his surgery, Taryn pointed out this proved her statement. In surgery, Levi asked Link about the Mariners job. Link admitted it was a crazy schedule though he added it didn't have to be a dealbreaker. He told Levi relationships are give and take and advised Levi to tell Nico how he felt about it. Later, Nico asked Levi to skip their speakeasy plans for the night and just head straight to bed, which Levi refuse because he wanted to talk about the job. Nico was annoyed and said he refused to feel bad about his dream job. Levi then pointed out he was the only one making sacrifices and compromises in their relationship. He wanted more and he was tired of telling Nico that. Nico then said he hoped Levi would find someone who could give that to him, ending things between them. Now being homeless as well, Levi went to Joe's by himself, where he met Jo. She invited him to stay with her at her loft, which she found too empty after Alex had left her. Levi gladly accepted.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Levi bonds with Jo.]]\nThey struck up a friendship and Levi opened up to her about how his mom suffocated him when he was living with her, which Jo commented didn't seem too bad. Levi initially was on the team to help figure out what was going on with Richard, but Jo made him help her out in the ER. He was disappointed but she told him a resident would not solve Richard's case. Later, he complained to her about a photo that Nico had posted on Instagram, which made it seem like Nico was totally fine without him. Jo was annoyed and pointed out that with all the other attendings working on Richard, this was Levi's moment to shine. That night, Levi said he felt like Jo had tried to make it clear to him that he had overstayed his welcome, so he was planning on sleeping at the hospital. Jo assured him he had the wrong idea but he had been messing up at work, which is why she had to yell at him as his attending. However, she said his living with her was keeping her sane, so she made him stay.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref> While working a case of a young baseball player whose lifelong dream was compromised by an injury, Levi really felt for the guy. Owen told him he needed to find a way to suck up his feelings or else find another job.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs COVID- first hit the United States, Seattle was amongst the country's cities to be hit the hardest, forcing Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to quickly adapt to the new reality. With all non-emergent surgeries cancelled, Levi often manned the tent outside the hospital where family could await updates on their loved onces since visitors were no longer allowed either. As such, he was often tasked with telling elderly people that their spouses of decades had passed away. At one point, Nico arrived and asked him to let Mrs. Bronson know that her husband's procedure had gone well. Levi blurted out he hoped Nico was doing okay despite things getting progressively worse around him because he still cared about him, even though they were no longer together. Levi himself was having a particularly bad time after telling the th person out there that their loved one had died and he was scared things would get much worse. Nico shrugged and said he was doing fine, after which he simply walked off. Soon after, a fight erupted in the tent between parents whose teenagers had gotten hurt while breaking quarantine rules. In their physical fight, they knocked Bailey to the ground.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nLevi got her to the OR and examined her ankle. He suspected a sprain but ordered an X-ray and paged Nico just to be safe. Nico asked to let him know the results. Levi bandaged up the ankle. Soon after, Nico came to confirm that there was no fracture. Levi was annoyed that he completely ignored the fact that Levi had been correct. Bailey then used Levi as her assistant to wheel her to her meeting with Catherine, where he witnessed how Maggie barged in to yell at Catherine to get back together with Richard. Afterward, Nico found Levi in a supply closet. He admitted he had been a terrible boyfriend but he came to provide Levi with some much-needed stress relief. Levi let him go down on him.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nAs the pandemic worsened, Richard announced that residents officially were only allowed to treat confirmed non-COVID patients. As a result, Levi had to fetch Jo for [[Val Ashton|Val Ashton's]] abdominal pain as her COVID test was still pending. It came back negative, but Bailey soon kicked Levi off the case to take his place when the scans showed a hepatic pregnancy.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nNico and Levi's stress relief agreement continued, though their interactions out in the public were limited to short greetings. However, Jo easily deduced what was going on by seeing Levi's face when Nico walked by. Levi admitted she was right and cited the Dutch government's advice to find a designated sex partner to satisfy his needs. However, after a terrible day, Nico came to sit down with Levi and told him that he hated everything but Levi. Levi said he wanted to invite Nico over since Jo wouldn't be home, though he recalled they hadn't been great to each other in the past and he wasn't sure that things had changed. Nico said a lot had changed in this pandemic and he accompanied Levi home.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nAs Jo grew increasingly depressed, Levi had to motivate her to get out of the bed in the morning. Together, they worked on [[Val Ashton]] with intern [[Reza Khan]], a fully-trained vascular surgeon from Pakistan who had to redo his training in order to obtain a medical license for the US. Reza was impressed with Jo's skills, which Levi had to point out meant something. He brought home pizza for dinner. Jo told him she had delivered a baby that day. The recently unparalleled joy she felt while doing so had made her consider switching to OB/GYN. Levi advised her to sleep on it before making such a major decision.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nWith a surge in cases, residents were allowed to treat COVID patients. While the rest of the staff treated two girls who were kidnapped by a suspected sex trafficker and later their kidnapper, Levi treated [[Opal]], who claimed to have been mugged in order to get inside the hospital. Ignorant of her involvement with the sex trafficking circuit, Levi examined her and didn't read into her subtle questions about the chaos surrounding kidnapper's case. After Opal disappeared to go \"to the restroom\", Levi called the cops so she could make a statement on the mugging. He later found Jo and asked if she had come to a decision. She picked up on his shaming her a little, as she suspected Meredith would, too, but Jo was more and more serious.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nNico and Levi regularly spent the night together. Levi was working the ER when Ben brought in Andrew, who had been stabbed while pursuing sex traffickers. After the initial surgery, Levi found Ben and asked him to let Carina know that Andrew was stable. Ben's phone caught his eye and Levi saw Opal, the woman he had treated the day before. Levi was shocked when Ben informed him of her identity and involvement in the ordeal and Levi began to worry that it was all his fault. Levi paged Nico for a peptalk. Nico listened to him and deemed that he wasn't in the right headspace to scrub in on Andrew's surgery, so Levi had Reza replace him. Levi then looked after Val Ashton, who crashed just as Cormac and Jo were bringing her baby over so Val could see her for the first time. Jo and Levi ran the code but they lost her. Levi then heard that Andrew was circling the drain and retreated to an on-call room, where Nico found him. Levi was worried that by spending so many years pretending to be someone he wasn't, he had wasted all the time he was supposed to be happy, since there was no sign of things going back to normal any time soon. Nico comforted him.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Andrew's memorial service, Nico and Levi sat down outside. Levi vented over all the feelings, including guilt and rage, that he felt over Andrew's death. Nico commented his go-to feeling was numb. Levi laughed and said that summed up everything that went wrong in their relationship. Levi heard that Bailey had launched an investigation into Andrew's death to see if any medical errors had been made. He found her by herself in an empty OR gallery and brought up the memorial service. He said he was a bad Jew in general but he did follow the traditions, because he found the protocols for how to grieve a loved one's death were helpful to start the healing. While he was on bad terms with his own mother, her death would still make him fall apart, so he could only imagine what Bailey was going through. He reminded her that she had people she could be with, people who needed to grieve with her. He advised her not to let the pandemic take that from her, too. Afterward, Levi attended the memorial service with Nico. They held hands in public, a possible sign of romantic reconciliation.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Levi began treating [[Marcella Diaz]] while the hospital ran low on available ventilators. As her sats dropped, Marcella was moved to the COVID ICU under Levi's care. As her condition worsened, Marcella's daughter [[Veronica Diaz]] was also admitted as her mild symptoms quickly progressed. Despite his best efforts, including a Hump Day rap, Marcella's condition worsened quickly despite BiPAP. Levi decided to intubate her to get her hooked up to a mechanical ventilator. He successfully did, but Maggie arrived moments later to inform him that Veronica had crashed and was in need of the last available ventilator. While Levi manually bagged Marcella, the doctors decided to follow protocol and give Veronica the ventilator. Fortunately, Maggie came up with a way that allowed patients to share on ventilator, so mother and daughter Diaz were hooked up to the same one. Levi was relieved to get a break and asked interns Alma and Sara Ortiz to keep him in the loop of all changes in their condition.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was one of the doctors who assisted in the free COVID testing center set up outside the hospital by the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]]. During a short break, Jo practiced her speech to convince Bailey to let her switch specialities on him. When a patient of Levi's test came back positive, Levi wanted to have him admitted since the patient lived with his family of six, including his grandfather, in a two-bedroom apartment. Since admitting him was not an option, Jackson handed Levi his credit card and told him to book the patient and any other patient in need a hotel room on him. Soon, the hotel manager asked if he just wanted to book an entire floor. [[Sara Ortiz]] got angry at Jackson when she heard about his actions, stating they hurt organizations for the underprivileged that had a struck a deal with hotel for discounts. Levi stood up for Jackson but Jackson was interested to hear her out. After work, Jo offered him a ride but he ended up biking home anyway because Richard asked Jo to talk about her switching specialties.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was tasked with accompanying a vastly asleep Meredith in the hyperbaric chamber, an ultimate attempt to get her to wake up. The room was double-booked so they were joined by [[James Chee]] and a patient who was healing from a post-op wound infection. Levi had been warned by Teddy and Bailey not to cause Meredith any stress. As they sat there, James asked about the kind of teacher Meredith was. Levi described her as the most influential teacher he had ever had, stating her voice echoed in his mind with every win he booked. Soon after, James' patient's sedation unexpectedly wore off and her movement caused her abdominal wound to open up with a subsequent evisceration. Recalling a similar experience, he remember Meredith's instructions and correctly handled the situation while the chamber was de-pressurized. Afterward, Jo found him as she'd heard he had saved a life. He told her that he wondered what Meredith would have done, which guided him to do the right thing. Jo recognized that from her own residency and then revealed she was serious about switching specialties.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\nJo and Levi developed a habit of watching movies together after work, though Levi often cancelled as he had begun meeting up with Nico again. After a night of hanging out, Nico waited for Levi at the hospital entrance and returned the bag he had left at his place the night before, stating it was in the way. Levi told Jo he hated how Nico wouldn't even allow him to have a drawer at his place. During the day, Levi worked with [[Erika Swift]], a patient who took the pandemic as an opportunity to turn her life around. During surgery, Levi told Bailey that that was what Jo wanted to do by switching specialties. Levi used Erika's story to confront Nico about being afraid to take the leap and carve out some space in his life for Levi. Nico realized he was right and asked Levi to move in, suddenly giving Levi cold feet. He made up an excuse about having to spend time with Jo and promptly left.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi's personality can be described as sweet and nerdy, but at times, through the eyes of his fellow surgeons, can be seen as clumsy and bumbling. Overall, he is very earnest with a kind heart, and always tries to prove himself at work.\n\n\n\n[[Nico Kim]]\nNico winked at Levi while operating, which confused him.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nLater, at Joe's bar, Nico bought him a beer after a rough day. Levi wanted to pay him back and grabbed his wallet, but Nico touched his hand to stop him and said Levi could buy the next one. Nico then left, with Levi staring after him.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nNico later came into the residents' locker room to shower despite having access to the fellows' lounge and Levi was shocked and distracted by seeing Nico with no shirt.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Nico then asked Levi if he would be willing to get that drink that evening, but Levi said he might have plans later. Nico just said he'd be a Joe's if his thing got cancelled. Later, Levi came to the bar for that drink, but Nico mostly brushed him off, confusing Levi.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nAfter working together on [[J.J. Williams]], Levi and Nico ended up in an elevator together and they kissed. They stopped when someone else got on the elevator, but once they were alone again, Nico apologized for what he'd done. Levi said it was fine and also that it was his first time and he was happy to learn. However, Nico said he didn't want to teach him.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nAfter being trapped together in an ambulance during the windstorm, Levi talked about having feelings for men before, but never exploring it because he was a nerd and never considered sex much at all. After his confession, Nico kissed him and the two of them had sex in the ambulance.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nTheir relationship continued to develop. Levi ultimately declared himself gay and happy while he was assisting on a surgery.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Levi's mother called while he was hooking up with Nico, Nico was upset when Levi shushed him. Levi tried to explain why his mother didn't know about Nico, but Nico wasn't persuaded and left. Later that day, Levi explained to Nico that his mother likes to talk about everything as if it's going to hurt him and he wants to lock Nico in in his own eyes before inviting his mother's criticisms because Nico's his first love. Hearing that Levi loved him, Nico kissed him and they started to walk away. Levi asked if he's not going to say it back. He said he would, but he wanted to make Levi sweat for a minute first.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nLevi learned that Nico had an upcoming job interview with a hospital in San Francisco, and expressed worry about a long-distance relationship through bringing up sports teams. While together on a case in which Nico had to fill the man's body with cement, Levi continued complaining about Nico's proposed move. Later, it was revealed that Nico made a mistake during the surgery, and the patient collapsed. Bailey ordered Levi to fix the man, as he was the grandson of a friend of hers, but things didn't go well, and the patient died. Later, Nico was about to do a Skype interview with his new prospective boss, and Levi attempted to persuade him to leave and re-schedule the interview. Nico spoke sharply to Levi, saying that he was not a failure, and implied that Levi is, which broke his heart. Levi was angered when Nico started the interview, and slammed the door behind him.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nNico was annoyed that he is relegated to simple tasks in the wake of his surgical error. Levi, on a high due to him saving the Seattle Fire Chief, ran to tell Nico about it. However, Nico didn't want to hear it and was rude to Levi, and demanded Levi's help in fixing a shoulder dislocation. Later, Link told Levi to leave Nico alone, and that if he wanted to talk, he should wait for him to say so.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nNico later realized via Link that his past behavior had been unacceptable, in the wake of a fog throughout Seattle, which led to a massive car pile-up on the freeway. He tracked Levi down, only for Levi to give him the cold shoulder, which immediately turned into lecturing on Levi's end when Nico informed him that he missed him. Levi told Nico about his day, and Nico listened, which culminated in Levi informing Nico that he loved him, but he still deserved better than how Nico had treated him. Nico came clean about his personal anger due to his failure, and that he was jealous of other doctors in the hospital, Levi especially, due to their ability to bond with patients and have successful moments. Levi immediately told Nico that he could help him, and wanted to. Later, the two tearfully watched ''My Girl'' in Levi's basement, and his mother came downstairs with chicken noodle soup. She was very welcoming towards Nico, but called him Levi's \"friend\". Levi immediately informed his mother that Nico was his boyfriend that Nico was the one who has been having a bad day.

You know what's also your fault? The fact that you think I have a shame spiral, because I don't. I'm not spiraling. I'm a nerd. I'm no more ashamed of being attracted to guys than I am of anything else in my life. Do you know what I did almost every night before I went to college? I sat in my mom's basement with three other debate-club kids playing Dungeons & Dragons, and it's the same basement I live in now. Trust me when I say no one was having sex. With guys or girls. Sex was like the Sunsword. It's a magical weapon in the game that's really hard to find. It's basically like a talking light saber, but... Never mind, doesn't matter. The point is sex wasn't on the table for us. So I didn't know I was gay. I knew that I had feelings for boys, but I didn't understand it. Not until you kissed me. You kissed me, and I felt the opposite of shame. I felt like I existed and everything fell in place. For the first time, it felt like I was holding the Sunsword, and I kno-- Are you just kissing me to get me to stop talking?<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n----\n:'''Levi to ([[Miranda Bailey|Miranda]]):''' I'm not a great Jew. I cheated at my bar mitzvah. I was too busy trying to ignore Lenny Rapkin's shins that I didn't learn Hebrew, so I just wrote it out phonetically and read that instead. I skip half the High Holy Days and repent for it at Yom Kippur. And if I'm honest, I go back and forth about believing in God, which is actually very Jewish, but... It\us the traditions that I find helpful. When a loved one dies, we have rules about how to grieve and move on. Protocols. We force ourselves to sit in the pain. We cry. And we laugh. And we eat a lot. And it doesn't bring the person back, but it does start the healing. Chief, your mom died. My mom makes me crazy, but I'm gonna fall apart when she dies. And you have people you can be with. People who love you and miss you and need to grieve with you. This pandemic has taken so much.

Extinguish it.|'''Owen Hunt''' to '''[[Amelia Shepherd]]'''}}\n\n'''Owen Hunt''' is the former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Trauma Surgery|Trauma]] and former [[Chief of Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He previously served in the Army but was honorably discharged due to the death of his entire platoon. He was first married to [[Cristina Yang]] and later to [[Amelia Shepherd]], but both marriages ended in divorce. He is currently raising his son [[Leo Hunt]] as well as his daughter [[Allison Hunt]] with his wife, [[Teddy Altman]].\n\n\n\nOwen grew up in Seattle, living with his parents and sister Megan just  miles from [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. As a child, he used to play soccer, playing left defender. He always used to imagine him and Megan living close to one another, near their parents, raising their kids together, and going on family camping trips and cookouts with their families.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x</ref>\n\nOne summer, Owen and Megan went on a family road trip in California but Megan left the map in a rest-stop bathroom. Their father was furious and he refused to pull over and ask for directions. After hours of arguing with Evelyn and the kids complaining, their father just pulled over at a beach and they played there for hours until the sun went down. It was one of the best experiences of his childhood.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x</ref>\n\nWhen he was almost  years old, he won a science award at school and ran home with the certificate. Before he could show his mother, she sat him down and told him that his father had died that day. On top of the grief of losing his father, Owen felt enormous guilt over having been so happy and proud while his mother had had such a bad day.\n\nHe attended [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard]]. He did his [[Resident|residency]] at [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] and then worked at Maryland Shock Trauma before commissioning in the army and becoming an army trauma surgeon.\n\n\nWhen Richard Webber offered Owen a job, he initially declined the offer because he hadn't finished his army tour in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Owen first came to Seattle Grace, to care for his patients as a Major, he and Cristina had an instant bond. At the same time, Cristina had slipped and been impaled with an icicle, so she was admitted to the hospital as a patient. Owen was there to pull it out and then later kissed her. He then returned after a short time and Cristina and Owen started dating. Cristina first started seeing signs of Owen's ongoing PTSD when Owen had a terrible nightmare due to the blades of the ceiling fan spinning, which was what he last saw before he fell asleep. In his sleep, Owen was strangling Cristina almost to the point of her death. Callie woke up due to the noise just as Owen woke up. It was later revealed in his nightmare Owen was trying to save himself.\n\nOwen immediately wanted to break up with Cristina, due to his sorrow and fear that he might do something like that again to her. Cristina fought it, saying that she was fine and understood why he did what he did. But later, after they had sex for the first time, Cristina admitted she couldn't take it, causing them to break up.\n\n\nWhile Cristina and Jackson were trying to save Derek's life after he was shot, the shooter shot Owen. Cristina told Meredith to take him to another OR and get the bullet out.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Cristina got pregnant, she stuck to her point of never wanting children and refused to have a proper discussion about with Owen, as she thinks a child should only be welcomed into a family where both parents want it. Thus, she scheduled an appointment for an abortion. He got angry about her decision and the fact that she didn't include him in it and threw her out of their house.\n\nOwen teamed up with Derek, who split up with Meredith over her tampering with his trial, and they started working on Derek's dream house while both claiming not to care about their wives anymore. Owen avoided Cristina and her calls, not knowing that she wanted to tell him she hadn't gotten the abortion yet. He heard about this from Meredith, who told him that Cristina couldn't do it because of her love for him. If Cristina were to have a child, she'd almost be killed pretending to love the kid as much as she loves surgery, which would also kill the kid. Meredith pointed out that she knows what it feels like to be raised by a Cristina and she made Owen realize that the guilt of resenting her own kid would eat Cristina, the woman he loves, alive.<ref>[[Free Falling]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith's speech and the fact that Cristina didn't have the abortion yet made Owen stop resenting Cristina. He searched for Cristina and asked her to sit down with him and talk. She asked him to postpone, as she was in the middle of trying to fix Meredith's abduction of Zola. Owen agreed and went to check up on [[Danny Wilson]], who made him realize that sometimes in a marriage, it's best to forget things and move on if the love is strong enough. He realized that that was the case in his marriage too. He and Cristina finally found time to talk and he asked her when the abortion appointment was. It was scheduled right then. \"Let's go,\" he said, making her cry because she finally felt like he understood her. In the doctor's office, an emotional Cristina assured the doctor she really wanted the abortion. The doctor then started the procedure, during which Owen held her hand.<ref>[[She's Gone]], x</ref>\n\n\nThey didn't talk after the abortion, having them struggle to find normalcy in their relationship again, as they were only able to have some small talk about dinner. Owen got promoted to Chief of Surgery, giving him even more professional duties. He and Cristina ordered Chinese from a bad restaurant, rendering them both sick on the bathroom floor and bringing them a little closer together.<ref>[[Take the Lead]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, just because he showed up for her at the abortion, Owen still was mad at Cristina for doing it. They avoided talking about it by just having sex. At Zola's birthday party, an argument about their work caused all of his frustrations to come. He yelled that she shattered all his hopes and dreams and the kind of life that he envisioned for himself, ultimately yelling in front of all their friends that she killed their baby.\n\nThey avoided each other until Valentine's Day when he saved her from being hit by a van crashing into the ER. She thanked him, but he nodded shortly and left her. Later that day, he told her he'd be moving out. This made her cry and she realized that she did not want him to leave her. She found him in the vent room and begged him (which she had refused to do) not to hate her, finally making physical contact again after weeks of avoiding each other.\n\nThey decided to go into couple's therapy, but they only ended up screaming at each other about their flaws and what they had been through, not making actual progress and putting them in a bad place again. This caused Owen to sleep with a woman he met at the hospital, a friend of his patient. He initially didn't tell Cristina, but her intuition told her he was sleeping with someone. After she couldn't find proof, she told him they needed to talk because it was driving her crazy, to the point that she suspected him to be cheating on her with nurse Emily. He said it hurt to love her and that he did not cheat on her with Emily, but that he did cheat on her.\n\nA mad Cristina then started ignoring him for days, finally communicating again when she outed her anger by throwing her bowl of cereal in his face. They later stayed home, pretending to have the flu, because Cristina wanted to hear about the cheating. He didn't want to talk about it in order not to hurt her, but she forced him to do it anyway. After a day of talking, it turned out that Owen, possibly subconsciously, did it in order to hurt Cristina back for the abortion. Cristina then threw him out of their firehouse, but eventually let him move back in as she was staying at Meredith's to study for the boards.\n\n\nAfter the plane crash survivors decided to not settle and sue instead, the hospital was at fault and originally, the insurance was supposed to pay the survivors, but after it was realized that only two attendings were allowed on a mediplane, the insurance company wouldn't pay, leaving the hospital to declare bankruptcy. Owen wanted Pegasus to buy the hospital, but in the end, the plane crash survivors and Callie bought the hospital with the settlement money, plus additional funding from the Harper Avery Foundation.\n\n\nAfter Russell quit, Owen contemplated giving Cristina the job of Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery so she wouldn't leave for Zurich. He had her do interviews with other candidates and while they were all fine, she didn't think one stood out. He reminded her they couldn't all be as good as her. At the end of the day, she still hadn't picked anyone and he said the Harper Avery Foundation was looking for a way to mend fences, and he suggested a large infusion of cash into the cardio department. Cristina figured out he wanted to offer her the job and told him not to. He confessed he had wanted to, but he realized she had to go. He only asked not to leave him until she was actually leaving. She agreed to this and they shared a kiss, briefly rekindling their romance once again.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a few weeks, the day came for Cristina's departure. She slept over that night to have one great night together but promised to meet him at the hospital for their own big goodbye. Cristina left to get a European charger for her phone at the mall, and later Owen saw on the news that the mall was supposedly bombed. While handling the crisis at the hospital, he feared Cristina got hurt, but she turned out fine at the hospital. However, they never found time to talk as he had to handle the crisis and media attention all the while treating patients who suffered from chemical burns. The big goodbye resulted in Cristina appearing in the gallery as Owen was operating. They shared a loving look and she waved, disappearing after he turned to the patient for a few seconds.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\nOwen dove into work to occupy his mind. Unbeknownst to him, April tried to look out for him, thinking Owen was dying inside and encouraged his male colleagues to be there for him. Owen didn't really appreciate the attention as he just had to deal with Cristina being gone on his own without extra attention.<ref>[[I Must Have Lost It on the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie, who had replaced Cristina, took on solving the cause of the McNeil's cardiac malfunction and eventually found the cause to be a genetic mutation, which only recently had been discovered, so Cristina couldn't possibly have found it out at the time. Tying up that loose end that Cristina left behind helped Owen to get more closure.<ref>[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]], x</ref>\n\nOwen teamed up with Callie to turn her research about robotic limbs into a project to help disabled veterans. He confessed to Callie that since Cristina, who was his family, was living her life happily without him, he needed something to get up in the morning and find new dreams. Cristina helped him get over the darkness that the Army left in him and he needed something to beat it back by doing something good.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n\n\nOwen eventually grew closer with Amelia and slept with her in an on-call room. They soon got involved in a romantic relationship.\n\n\nOwen was one of the first people to hear about Derek's death when Meredith returned to the hospital. He admitted her after she lost consciousness and worried about Amelia's reaction, only to find out no one had told her as she was in surgery. He waited until she was done to deliver the news, with her already deriving from his facial expression that someone died. She claimed she was okay, having gone through it all before, and rejected his attempt to comfort her. Around Easter, a few weeks after Derek's death, Owen got an opportunity to do another Army tour. Owen accepted as he wanted to get away from it all, with Richard taking over his Chief duties at the hospital, and his talks about the Army convinced April to join him. Owen returned at the beginning of the next year, only to find Amelia in the middle of a mental breakdown at the hospital. Seeing Owen, still in his army uniform, embarrassed Amelia, and she walked off. He later found her stumbling around at Derek and Meredith's house, where she confessed that she scored oxy from a junkie doctor and that she was seriously considering taking it. Owen got through to her and made her realize that she shouldn't be managing her feelings or run away from them; she should allow herself to feel the pain, as that's the normal and human thing to do. As he pointed out, taking the oxy would cause her to spiral out of control. She handed him the oxy and she broke down in his arms as he comforted her.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nOwen shortly resumed his position as Chief of Surgery, only to reveal he was stepping down as he felt it was time for something else. Owen clashed with Jackson over an experimental procedure on a victim of a tunnel collapse and Owen pulled it off. It turned out well in the end, but Jackson still thought Owen got lucky. They talked about April, who changed after returning, and Owen concluded that's what often happens after an Army tour. It's what made him realize he didn't want to be Chief anymore, too.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\nOwen also worked on Keith, the man who got trapped in his crushed car after the tunnel collapse. Afterward, he talked with Amelia. He misinterpreted what she said about something working out for a patient as if it was about two of them, and awkwardly left. He later found her sitting by herself in Meredith's bedroom. She received Meredith's old phone with Derek's last voice mail message, but couldn't bring herself to hit play. Owen did that for her and wanted to give her privacy, but she preferred him to stay. They listened to the message. Amelia got emotional, but she assured Owen she was okay. They returned to the party and danced it out.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\nAfter three months, Owen and Amelia were still doubtful as to what kind of relationship they were in. Owen had concert tickets and wanted to invite Amelia, but he wasn't sure if he should. He asked Callie for advice, and she told him he was overthinking it. In surgery, Owen noticed some tension between Meredith and Amelia, because of their fight over whether or not to tear down a wall at the house the three sisters were sharing. At the end of the day, Owen had to give Amelia a ride home as Meredith, with whom Amelia carpooled to work, left without her. As he dropped her off, he told her he didn't mind giving her a ride and kissed her. As Amelia wondered what that meant, Maggie came outside and dragged Amelia inside, leaving Owen outside on the front porch.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nThe abrupt interruption left Owen to wonder what the kiss meant as he asked her out and Amelia spent the next day ignoring him. He vented his worries to April, but she was concerned about her own marriage and simply told him to go talk to Amelia. Owen ended up in an elevator with Amelia and asked her if she was angry or confused. She told the latter. Owen asked to talk, but she says that would just lead to them kissing again without them even knowing why. They wondered what it meant and just ended up kissing again.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\nOwen was invited to the sisters' dinner party, and Callie suggested they drive there together after her consult was done. He was dressed casually and she reminded him Amelia was there, suggesting to dress up more. They arrived, only to find a quiet and cold dinner party as Meredith just revealed Penny, Callie's girlfriend, was the one who killed Derek. Amelia got angry at Meredith for not informing her before about who Penny was and they yelled at each other. A frustrated Meredith yelled at Owen to get Amelia out of her sight. Owen took Amelia to her room where she calmed down. She wondered how he could always stay calm, but he pointed out he was far from perfect. He confessed that when he heard Cristina's plane crashed, he was briefly relieved because he'd always known she was going to leave him one day and if she died, they'd just be frozen in time forever without any painful or messy break-up. He pointed out he always makes things harder than they should be, them included. They agreed it wasn't the worse thing not to be perfect and snuggled on the bed.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n\n\nA few days later, Owen was at work when he encountered [[Nathan Riggs]] in the ambulance bay. Nathan informed him he worked with April back in Jordan and that he was here with a kid that required Jackson's expertise. Due to their obviously negative history, Owen made it clear that he didn't want Riggs around and told him to leave immediately after the surgery.<ref>[[The Me Nobody Knows]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a night shift, Owen was woken up by Amelia as she laid down with him in the on-call room. They cuddled and talked about her day until he got paged away. In the ER, he found Nathan working on one of Maggie's patients, much to his and Maggie's surprise. They went to Bailey, who revealed she had hired Nathan and simply forgot to tell Maggie. Owen went to Meredith to ask her how she could work with Penny given their horrible history, and he concluded he simply couldn't do what she was doing. Nathan being around triggered Owen's PTSD and intern Isaac found Owen hallucinating and shaking in an on-call room. Owen snapped out of it and told Nathan to leave. At the end of the day, Bailey wanted to introduce everyone to Nathan, but Owen made it clear they already knew each other. Owen stated Bailey made a mistake hiring him and blamed her, saying she should've asked around before hiring a complete stranger. Bailey offered to go talk it out, but he said it was done. He went to the ambulance bay to cool down and refused to talk to Amelia when she came over to try and help him. Meredith tried as well and he told her he didn't want to talk. Meredith revealed she promised Cristina not to let him get all dark and twisty and to be his person if he needed one. Owen said he didn't want to talk, but all Meredith needed to know was if they were hating Nathan. Owen nodded and replied that they were really, really hating him.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref>\n\nA few days and night shifts later, Amelia tried to talk to Owen, but he blocked her off and stated he was fine, yet he still had a hateful look in his eyes every time he saw Nathan. That day, lots of burned firefighters came in one of which was John, Owen's mother's boyfriend. Owen found out when his mother appeared in the ER, looking for John. Owen checked John's chart and saw Meredith and Nathan were operating on him. He angrily went to the OR and requested that Maggie replace Nathan, but Nathan refused to leave per his request as he didn't work for Owen. Owen was forced to leave as he couldn't give a valid reason. Amelia noticed he was really bothered by Nathan working on John and asked why. Owen said he simply didn't want Nathan around his family and took off. Owen later argued with his mother, who didn't seem to have a problem with Nathan. Amelia chased after him afterward and again offered his help, but he firmly stated he didn't want her help on this. Owen and Nathan ran into each other in the ICU. Nathan tried to talk to him, mentioning he talked to \"ma\", Owen's mother. Owen told him to run far away and never come near his family again. Nathan replied they were his family too, which lead to Owen's punching Nathan twice. He said they weren't his family and took off. The news quickly spread. Meredith found Owen outside on a bench and told him Bailey was looking for him. She said he was getting himself in trouble. He replied he knew. Meredith then revealed she talked to his mother, saying she knew about his sister.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\n\nMegan returned after being found in a basement in a rebel-led neighborhood. She had been treated relatively well and was fine except for a frozen abdomen, which Meredith miraculously fixed by performing an abdominal wall transplant. Owen remained with Megan as she recovered. After finally being discharged from the hospital, she temporarily moved in with him until she decided to move to Malibu with her fianc\ue Nathan and her son Farouk. While those two went to the new house to prepare, Megan drove up there with Owen with the last of their stuff. During their trip, she and Owen resolved old feuds, and after pointing out that it was time for him to let go of some of his ideals, she dropped him off at the airport. He returned home and told Amelia he wanted to call it quits since it felt like he didn't really know her. She understood and they returned their rings. The two remained friends while occasionally hooking up.\n\nAmelia later stated her theory that their marriage was doomed from the beginning due to Owen having unresolved feelings for Teddy, which drove Owen to make a heat-of-the-moment decision to fly to Germany to see Teddy. Once there, he declared his love for her and they spent the day together. However, after Owen confessed that it was Amelia who told him to come - just after they had finished having sex themselves, no less - Teddy was enraged and kicked him out, refusing to speak to him anymore, and Owen returned to Seattle.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:xLeo.png|thumb|px|Owen and baby Leo.]]\nFinally deciding to act on his long dream of having children, Owen filed to foster-to-adopt. After a -hour shift, he received a surprise call that there was a social worker coming over with a baby. Panicking because he wasn't prepared at all, Owen called Amelia to help him clean the house and get everything ready. Amelia arrived with a marijuana-high Alex, whom she was babysitting, and they cleaned the house in preparation for the social worker's arrival. Owen ended up with a baby boy named Leo. Amelia then drove them to Meredith's house to get baby supplies while reassuring Owen, who feared he had forced becoming a father. Alex told him that him caring so much meant that it'd be alright, which settled his concerns. At the end of the day, Amelia decided to stay at Owen's to help him get through his first night as a parent.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nOwen took Leo for a six-month check-up at the hospital and met up with [[Betty Nelson]], Leo's birth mother. Amelia later joined them as they waited. After Arizona cleared him, Owen took Leo to daycare while Amelia spent time with Betty. She learned she was an addict and wanted to guide her sobriety. After checking in with the social worker, Amelia shared her plan with Owen, who offered to come live with him so Leo could have his mother in his life. Betty accepted the offer and they all went home while setting ground rules.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref> Owen took care of Leo while Amelia helped Betty through the worst stages of withdrawal. While he was at work, Betty ran off.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref> She returned after a few days and Owen informed Amelia. She claimed she had tried to get a fix but to no avail, so she squatted on a friend's couch until she missed Leo so bad that she had to come back. At work, [[Matthew Taylor]] was brought in after a car accident. They wanted to alert April but couldn't get a hold of her, so Owen had the paramedics bring him back to the site of the accident. He eventually found April in a ravine off the road, partially submerged in a river. They brought her back to the hospital and did everything they could to warm and wake her up. Owen ordered the entire time to pray for her. She eventually recovered and thanked her mentor for always bringing her back.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nA month later, on the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Betty was  days sober. Amelia had invited her parents, but they didn't show up. They got dressed for the wedding and took Leo and Betty with them. They arrived as the first guests because Owen had trusted his own sense of direction instead of following a faulty GPS link like the other guests. Amelia left Betty with Owen and Leo while she went to help look for Alex and Jo. While alone, Betty questioned if he and Amelia were a couple or not. Owen said they weren't and said Amelia had a tumor, which complicated things. Betty pointed out that the tumor was gone, so it was just a weird situation now instead of complicated. Owen later helped in saving the wedding planner's life when she suffered a severe allergic reaction. Afterward, the ceremony was called off and Owen joined the other guests on the ferry back to the city, where they witnessed an impromptu wedding officiated by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nThe next morning, Teddy showed up at his house. While he was sleeping, Betty answered the door and inadvertently told her about the baby, after which she made up an excuse and left. He was thus surprised to run into her at the hospital. She briefly mentioned the interim Chief position but said she was leaving. She quickly said goodbye and left, leaving Owen to wonder why she was in the city and hadn't even called him. Owen subtly threw his name in the mix for the interim Chief position by reminding Bailey he once held the job. During surgery, he saw Amelia admiring his work from the gallery. Back at home, Amelia blurted out that she had feelings for him again but that she could understand if he didn't want to go there again. She wanted him to know, as she couldn't forgive herself if her hiding her feelings made him chase after Teddy. She assured him she wouldn't stand in his way if he was still in love with Teddy. Owen says Teddy accused him of being incapable of being alone and he didn't want her to be right, but he then kissed Amelia.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nThey soon moved to the couch to make out, but Leo crying interrupted them. Owen and Amelia treated a man who got injured in a motorcycle accident without wearing a helmet. The situation made Owen think they were doing something risky themselves. Last time they tried to be together, there were no strings attached, but now they had Betty and Leo to think about. They agreed they couldn't be reckless and set up to talk it through after surgery. During their talk, he said he wanted all the strings, the kids, the fighting, and a noisy house, but he wasn't sure if she did, too. She said the tumor was gone now, but as an addict, she was still wary of change and commitment. Since she didn't want to threaten the kids' stability, she promised to try and be less wary. Having decided to go for it, they went home together holding hands.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nAs they started to spend nights together again and got used to parenting, they agreed their new life with kids worked. At work, Maggie and Owen had a shared patient and Maggie was pretty hostile towards him after a disagreement. He figured she had a problem with him and Amelia getting together again and assured her that he was all in with her, Leo, and Betty. She apologized for her behavior and left him. After a talk with Maggie, Amelia shared with Owen that Maggie's behavior had nothing to do with them.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nBetty's struggle with sobriety continued and she got into a fight with Amelia when the latter suspected she had a slip and lied about it. Owen urged them to keep it down for Leo. Amelia grounded Betty and took her to the hospital for a tox screen. Amelia struggled with disciplining a teenager as her mother never did that to her. Owen said that his mother was the opposite and Amelia called her for advice behind his back. He was confused when he spotted his mother passing through the ER. Later, Owen and Betty waited for Amelia to go home. She wondered how he could live with Amelia. He said he was honest with her and accepted her, as intense as she maybe. As Amelia arrived, Betty admitted she had gotten high on \"just weed\", Amelia scolded her and grounded her for a month. They then all left together.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nAs part of her being grounded, they dropped Betty off at school. Amelia suspected she would play hookey, so they drove around to make sure Betty wasn't ditching out the back. While waiting, Owen found out Amelia had installed apps to track Betty's location and texts. He called that obsessive and deleted them with her permission. They shared some of their own school experiences with one another. After a couple of hours, the concerned school VP sent them away when they clumsily explained their situation. They moved to a different spot and caught Betty trying to sneak out with friends. Owen whistled to alert her of their presence and she went back in. When Amelia was changing Leo, Owen wondered how their disagreement about kids could have broken up their family. She reminded him of the tumor and added that this family unit had now convinced her that nothing could erase her baby boy from her memory, something that had always plagued her when she was thinking about starting a family. After school, Betty got back in their car and commented on them camping out there all day.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy showed up at his house and this time, Owen answered the door himself. She apologized for her last visit but he said he should be apologizing instead of her for not having told her about Betty and Leo. Before she could share her news, Amelia returned to look for Betty, who had run away from school. The three of them looked for her around the city but didn't find her. They reconvened at the house and contemplated calling the police. Amelia needed a meeting so Owen took her to one while Teddy stayed at the house in case Betty showed up. When he came home with Leo, he and Teddy had a talk and he said he hadn't told her about Betty and Leo because he felt embarrassed after her accusation. He assured her that the new situation was not just him incapable of being alone as he had always wanted a kid. He told her he was happy and went to put Leo down. She then decided not to tell him about the pregnancy and left. When Amelia returned, he comforted her while she feared that Betty might be dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWhen a windstorm was heading towards the city, Teddy came to the hospital to help out. Owen asked her how long she would be staying but she replied she had no idea. Owen helped prepare the ER for all incoming patients and later got pulled onto a case with Teddy. She alerted him when she saw Betty walking around. Owen and Amelia checked out her head lac caused by a tree branch. As Amelia had to leave for surgery, Owen set up further care for her. He then joined Teddy and Jackson in the scrub room and she asked him to get coffee afterward so they could talk. In surgery, he figured she wanted to talk about the reason she had come back to and stuck around in Seattle. She wanted to wait to talk, but as soon as the patient was out of the woods, she told him that she was pregnant with his baby. He was baffled and she was paged to the ER. Jackson told him he was the last to find out about Harriet, too, but it was the best thing that happened to him.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen confronts Teddy about having kept the pregnancy secret for so long.]]\nOwen then found Teddy and got on an elevator with her and her patient. He questioned how she could have kept this from him for so long. She replied it hadn't been easy for her. Amelia then got on, too, and shared her plans to become Betty's official foster mother. She then picked up on the awkward vibe and asked what was going on. Before he could answer, the power died and they got stuck in between floors.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nThe power got back on soon, but the elevator remained stuck. Owen then told Amelia that Teddy was pregnant and she figured out the baby was his. Owen then realized Teddy had known for a while and got angry with her. The patient started crashing and they rushed to save him. While working on him, Teddy clarified she had planned to tell him the day she got here, but then she found out he had started a family already in record time. He questioned what she meant when she said nobody expected him to do anything. Teddy said the two of them getting together was off the table, so he could be with Amelia. However, she was going to stay in Seattle so the baby could have a father and she could have her friend. Owen asked her how far along he was. She told him  weeks and assured him that the baby was fine. Amelia and Teddy started arguing until the elevator doors opened and they rushed the patient to an OR. Teddy and Owen saved the man.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia leaves Owen to consider all his options.]]\nAfterward, she told Owen she did want him to be involved and he said he did, too. They agreed to figure it out together and hugged to celebrate that they were having a baby. Later, Owen went to Amelia and assured her nothing would change, but she knew him and his history with Teddy and gave him time to consider all of his options. She didn't come home that night. Alone with Leo, Owen told him they would be fine.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nThe situation with Amelia made him angry at Teddy, since her keeping the secret caused him to have to choose between them. She quipped that she had upended her whole life so he could be a father. Amelia overheard him venting his anger to Teddy. She told him they were arguing like a couple, but he insisted they were not. During a quick turnover in the OR, Owen was accidentally paralyzed. Levi saved him and got him to a bed in the ICU. Teddy found out and came to sit by his side. They had an honest conversation and she told him that while she had made mistakes, too, he was the one who came to Germany and then returned to Seattle to start a family. She was thinking about moving back to Germany to her old job, but Owen had come to realize it was time for him to sacrifice something. He told her he would step down and give her his job. When he was cleared to go, he went looking for Amelia and told her truthfully that he wanted Teddy to stay here, but that he also loved his family with Amelia and that he couldn't do any of this without her. He told her he needed her and they went home together.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Owen and Teddy stood outside in the snow together as he invited her to spend Christmas with him, Amelia, and Leo, whom he was trying to create traditions with. She declined as she had to cover his shift at the ER. He promised her they would establish their own traditions with their baby. Shortly after New Year's, Owen accompanied Teddy to an ultrasound and they found out they were having a daughter. Later, Owen went to rehab with Amelia to visit Betty, who revealed her real name was Britney and that she had run away from home and her parents, who didn't know about Leo. Furious over her lie and fearful of losing Leo, Owen wanted to reach out to Britney's parents, but Amelia told him it was Betty's choice and that it was all part of the disease that is addiction. He lashed out and disagreed, stating it sounded like an excuse to justify piss poor life choices. He noticed he had offended Amelia and came around, saying he was worried over losing Leo. They hit a rough spot but he apologized with a bouquet of flowers on Valentine's Day, after which they attended the wedding of [[Natasha Deon]] and [[Garrett Boland]].<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after, Owen learned that Teddy had grown closer to Tom over the holidays. At the same time, Amelia learned that Betty had run away from rehab. He was surprised when Amelia came to tell him that Betty's parents had shown up after receiving a call from her from rehab. Amelia had explained the situation to them and they wanted to spend time with Leo, which didn't sit well with Owen. Confronted with the very real possibility of Leo being taken away, Owen dove into work and made sure a father didn't lose his son. He then decided he wouldn't let John and Carol take Leo without a court order. Powerless, they left, and Owen yelled at Amelia for revealing to them her own struggle with addiction. Amelia said she wouldn't stand in the way of him fighting for Leo and pointed out he was just a foster parent and that he had wanted Leo's mother in his life. She stated he didn't even seem to care that Betty was missing. He stated that her name was Britney and that she was never much of a mother and left.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nDespite his efforts, he had to concede to John and Carol taking their grandson home. He and Amelia said their goodbyes to Leo when they came to pick him up. Owen then quickly left for work, unable to deal with losing Leo. That day, the hospital was flooded with overdose victims, and Betty and her boyfriend were discovered among them. Owen jumped into action to save her when she deteriorated. Teddy diagnosed an aortic dissection while Owen intercepted Amelia and Betty's parents. They started arguing until Teddy came to inform them of her decision to operate on Betty herself. Owen wanted to join her, but Bailey forbade him. Owen and Amelia sat in the waiting room with John and Carol. John told Owen about the last words he said to Britney before she had run off, which were \"I can't even stand to look at you.\" Eventually, Teddy came to tell them that Betty had made it. While she took Amelia and Betty's parents to see her, Owen took care of Leo so they could focus on their daughter. He later joined them in Betty's ICU room as she woke up and was comforted by her parents.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nThe Dickinsons and Owen and Amelia worked together to take care of Leo during Betty's recovery period. When she was better, they arranged for Betty and Leo to go home with John and Carol. After the Dickinsons thanked the two of them, they left.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen learns of Tom and Teddy's relationship.]]\nOwen and Amelia needed to get out of the house and attended Catherine's party, where Owen was confronted with Teddy and Tom's new romantic relationship. He learned Tom was taking her on a surprise trip to Palm Springs, which upset Owen even more. He angrily stared at Tom the entire night and got in a fight with Amelia over his not accepting addiction as a disease. She hated how he didn't even check on how she feeling through all of this and told him it was hard to talk with him staring at Teddy the entire time. She walked away and Owen discovered Jackson and Richard weren't fond of Tom either. He went to find Amelia and clarified he was actually staring at Tom, whom he didn't want to be in his daughter's life. Amelia thought it was about his feelings for Teddy. Owen denied that and wondered how many times he had to choose Amelia over Teddy before she would believe him. Amelia then said it was an impossible situation and that she had decided to step out of it because unlike for him, there was no baby forcing her to stay in it.\n\nAs his anger amped up, Owen went to try to talk Teddy out of taking the trip, but she insisted on going and defended Tom, who joined them. Owen then started yelling at him, disrupting the celebratory speech. He thought Tom was preying on a pregnant woman and he didn't want Tom in his daughter's life, stating he was not a father. Tom then punched Owen in the face for what he said. Tom put his hand in ice to hear the rest of the speech while Owen was kept away from him, but the party was cut short when the penthouse was evacuated due to smoke originating from the kitchen. He came home and found Amelia waiting for him with the Dickinsons. They had come to realize they were too old to raise Leo and they would have their hands full with Betty, who wanted to be a teenager and didn't want to raise Leo herself either. They all agreed Owen and Amelia were Leo's true parents.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nHe and Amelia then met with a lawyer to arrange the adoption. They hit a bump when the lawyer discovered he and Amelia were no longer living together and hadn't really discussed how they would split their time with Leo. She left them to discuss it before taking the case to a judge. They settled on a -- approach, but Amelia commented that it would probably change when Owen and Teddy's baby would be born. He repeated that he chose her over Teddy and wanted her in both his and Leo's life, but Amelia insisted that her decision hurt her less than being with him did. He blamed her for not being capable of loving and being loved. Amelia then decided to withdraw her name from the adoption. While she wanted to be in Leo's life as much as she could, she acknowledged Leo had always been Owen's and that this was the best option now that the two of them were over. The judge approved the adoption and Owen signed the papers at home with Leo by his side.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nOwen struggled as a newly legal father without Amelia to help him out. At work, Owen worked on a trauma patient while Teddy worked on the man's pregnant wife. Owen offered to take over from Teddy given the woman's pregnancy, but Teddy declined. However, he insisted to sit with her by the woman's bedside to make sure she wouldn't re-bleed. She made him rub her feet and they fell asleep. Eventually, the patient started bleeding again. Owen updated the husband and then joined her in the OR. They had to perform a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding, which meant delivering the preterm fetus, who passed away in his father's arms. Owen watched over Teddy as she checked on the devastated couple in post-op and held her as she broke down in his arms.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nOwen decided to come to Teddy's birthing class. He was surprised when he found out Tom in there, while Teddy herself hadn't shown up. She was experiencing a complication and only paged Owen, who kept it a secret from Tom and left the class. Teddy was diagnosed with cervical insufficiency, which was treated with the Trendelenburg position. [[Carina DeLuca|Carina]] asked him to make sure Teddy and the baby stayed calm, so he started talking to the baby in a baby voice, which freaked Teddy out. She expressed her fear of failing as a mother. Owen then got a gurney and lied down in Trendelenburg next to her to show her they were in this together. He told her all a parent can do is their best, admitting to several mistakes with Leo. Owen then told the baby that she wouldn't ever have to worry because her mother was so strong and fierce. Tom came in, having found out about the situation. Owen left to get coffee and Tom followed him. He blamed Owen for not informing him and warned him to rethink his decision if he was planning to make a move for Teddy, whom he had hurt and abandoned over and over, since Tom was willing to fight for her, which would bring about a lot of unnecessary pain and drama for Teddy. Tom thought Teddy deserved someone for whom she was the first and only choice. Owen then backed out and stood outside briefly while Tom fed Teddy ice cream.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile Leo started teething, Owen and Amelia kept their communication to a minimum. Owen found out Tom and Teddy were looking for houses and offered Teddy to come to live with him, but she declined. Meredith secretly arranged an abdominal wall-penis-scrotum transplant on a veteran patient of Megan Hunt's, who flew over and surprised Owen. She learned that Teddy was pregnant but dismayed upon finding out that she and Owen were not together. She found out the whole story and called Owen a dum-dum for all the stupidity he had displayed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen advocates for Caleb.]]\nWhen the transplant was canceled because the patient had lied about his support system, Owen talked about the losses he had endured in the Army himself and the shame he felt over how he reacted to them. He advised Caleb not to shut out his fianc\uee, stating people can show up for you in unbelievable ways when you let them. Owen convinced Catherine that Caleb needed the surgery to move forward and they performed it successfully. Afterward, Megan told Owen to do for himself what he had done for Caleb. She thought PTSD and war made him think he wasn't entitled to joy, which she thought was the reason behind all the hard choices he had made for himself. She made him realize he wasn't well and that he needed to work on fixing himself. He agreed to go back to therapy.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nShe recommended a therapist and called him the day of his appointment to make sure he'd go. Owen was skeptical of NET and muscle testing, but he gave it a go since it had helped Megan. Owen talked about the Germany situation and the therapist suggested his bad behavior there wasn't on accident. He thought Owen was stuck in a pattern and that they needed to find the cause in order to stop it. The muscle testing narrowed the root of the problem down Owen's own distrust. Further exploring revealed that the memory causing the pattern happened when he was . He had won a science award at school and ran home with the certificate to show his mother, but before he could do so, she told him that his father had died. He then hid the certificate and felt so ashamed for being so proud and happy while his mother was so sad. The therapist told Owen that the memory caused him not to trust joy, fearing it would always be followed by bad news. He put Owen in a specific position, allowing him to let go of that distrust. After weeping in his therapist's arms for finally letting himself experience joy again, Owen went home. Teddy checked in on him through a text and he told her about the session.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nBack at work, Owen learned that Amelia and Link had grown closer and that Teddy was still house hunting while Tom had started to plan the delivery, including a playlist. Amelia came in to clear Owen's patient's brain scans and he asked her about Link, but she told him it was none of his business. He found her later and told her that therapy had made him realize that he was actually the one who was incapable of love. She thanked him for saying that and he invited her to spend more time with Leo, who was missing her. Afterward, Owen returned to his therapist and told him the first session had worked. He had realized that he loved Teddy and he wasn't feeling guilty about it anymore. He asked for more sessions so he would feel perfectly clear when he would tell Teddy.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nOwen went to the airport to help [[Frances Pinfield]], a severely agoraphobic blood donor for [[Gus Carter]], get off her plane and to the hospital. It took a FaceTime conversation with Gus's mother and Owen carrying her to the limo to do so. While en route to the hospital, thick fog started to cover part of the city and the limo got in the middle of a pile-up on the freeway.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen supports Teddy through the delivery.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Teddy hold their baby girl Allison.]]\nEveryone made it out fine and Owen arranged an ambulance as a ride to the hospital. He helped out with the patient in the rig. The ambulance arrived together with the police car that transported a laboring Teddy and Amelia. He accompanied Teddy to the delivery room and apologized for hiding his fling with Carina, her OB, which she had found out about through Amelia. Teddy forbade Owen from watching what was going on between her legs. With the head halfway out, Teddy needed to be distracted while waiting for the next push. Owen then told her he was in love with her and had always been. He hadn't understood he was allowed to be happy and he had been afraid of the way he felt around her because it felt so good, so he sabotaged it before life could do it for him. He told her he wanted to spend the rest of his life proving to her that he was worthy of her love. She then gave the final push and their daughter was born. They simultaneously decided to name her Allison. Owen stayed by Teddy's side and they spent time together with their baby daughter.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia dropped by with Leo so he could meet his sister. Bailey then came in to fetch him and Amelia for trauma since she had to fire three attendings and Andrew was in jail. A week later, Teddy had returned to her hotel room. Owen found her and Allison both crying when he dropped by with supplies. He offered to come home with him, but she refused to start their life together in that house. He took Allison from her so she could go shower. He tried to help out as much as he could, but in his eager efforts to help out, he bluntly offered to milk Teddy when she had clogged duct and heat pads weren't helping. She was offended and shut him out. She developed the habit to bring Allison to the hospital when she started panicking, so he went to look for her there. He told Amelia what had happened and she told him that giving birth was a beast to a woman's body, so he would need to be patient with Teddy. After weeks of tiptoeing around Teddy, he visited her again in her hotel room and told her he had listed his house and had hired a realtor to find them a new one, already having hundreds of listings for them to go through. In the meanwhile, he had upgraded them to the suite. He also demanded that she'd let him help out as it was too much for her on her own. She got up and thanked him with a kiss.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Tom taunted Owen for his leaving Teddy in a hotel. Owen suggested he go back to his job in Baltimore, after which Tom revealed to him his new position at the Foundation, which made him Owen's boss. While working to resuscitate [[Reid Kim]], Owen accidentally shocked Tom in the crotch with the defibrillators. He quickly apologized to Tom while rushing Reid to the OR. Later, he stopped by Tom's room to properly apologize and found out that Tom had obtained an emergency restraining order against him for acute physical and emotional distress. Owen objected that they worked together but Tom just asked him to leave.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nTom used the restraining order to show his dominance over Owen by having kicked out of his own trauma room and the ER. He found Teddy struggling to change Allison on a bench outside and took over for her. Afterward, he suggested they take a tour of the hospital to humor Teddy. He showed her scans of his patients and she eagerly pitched a solution, making him realize how much she missed work. They moved to the OR gallery to avoid Tom and he suggested he stay home with Allison for a while so she could go back to work. She refused because she didn't like admitting she was failing as a mother. He said he didn't like work having to avoid Tom and pointed out returning to work would make her happy again, which in turn would make her a better mother. She then happily accepted and left to get changed to start working.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAfter dropping off Leo at daycare, Owen ran into Bailey in the ambulance and he informed her of his paternity leave because of Koracick's restraining order. An ambulance arrived with [[Yan Huang]], who refused to be treated at Grey Sloan because of Meredith's recent negative article. Owen then jumped onto the rig to provide care while Yan was transported to Pac-North. Upon arrival, he was confronted with an incompetent resident in the ER and he decided to deliver the patient straight to the OR. He handed the patient off to Richard and ran into Alex, who invited him for a tour after learning of his leave. Alex talked about the investors' big checks and his plans for the future. During the tour, they answered a woman's call for help from the ICU as another incompetent resident was failing to stop her husband's post-op hemorrhage. Owen and Alex jumped in and Owen learned just how bad the residents were. During surgery, Owen talked about his leaving Grey Sloan and Alex offered him the job of Head of Trauma, allowing him to structure the department as he saw fit. Owen accepted the position because he liked the chaos, which reminded him of the Army. Afterward, he went to pick up Teddy and Leo at Grey Sloan, where they ran into Tom, who had come to realize they needed good doctors and had gotten rid of the restraining order so Owen could come back. Owen replied he had quit and taken another job at Pac-North, surprising both Tom and Teddy.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Owen dropped off a box of his old handmade Halloween costumes for Teddy at Grey Sloan. At work, several patients in the ICU started crashing while the discovery of a mass grave sent rumors of the place being haunted around the hospital. He and Alex set out to investigate and discovered that a faulty fridge in the ICU's own blood supply had caused the blood to hemolyze. In the evening, he met up with Teddy for the Halloween parade on the peds floor. Teddy told him she wouldn't be making costumes for their children like his mother had. He knew that and didn't expect her to, which is why he brought over the box to see if any of the costumes fit Leo or Allison. He understood Teddy had assumed he had tried to shame her. She admitted it had inspired her and revealed she had dressed up their children as zombies, which he thought was inappropriate for kids.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nOne day, Teddy dropped Owen off at work and he wanted to take a picture of Allison, but his phone storage was full. Amelia visited him, supposedly to return one of Leo's favorite toys, but she actually blurted out that she was pregnant with Link's baby. As she told him that she wanted Leo in the baby's life, paramedics brought in Cassidy Gardner, who had fallen down the stairs and was found by her young son. An ultrasound revealed that Cassidy was pregnant. She already knew and was disappointed that she was still pregnant after the fall. She said she couldn't have another baby. Owen went to tell Amelia since Cassidy wouldn't elaborate.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Amelia disagree over Cassidy's wanting an abortion.]]\nTogether, they went in to tell her that the necessary splenectomy could endanger the fetus. Cassidy didn't want another child. Owen bluntly asked if she had thrown herself down those stairs to terminate the pregnancy. She swore she hadn't. She had tried to get help in a clinic with financial assistance but something always fell through so she made a tea she had found online, which made her dizzy and caused her to fall. She swore she would never do something to hurt herself or her son. Amelia offered to get someone for the abortion so it could be performed during Owen's surgery but Owen interjected that he'd rather deal with the surgery first and the pregnancy afterward. Outside the room, Owen scolded Amelia for overstepping and shut her down when she tried to make her case, after which he dismissed her. Owen performed the surgery and found Amelia and OB nurse in Cassidy's room when he came for a post-op exam. He was mad at Amelia for going behind his back but she stated she was only providing the help that he wouldn't give Cassidy. She suspected it had something to do with her own pregnancy. Owen threw in her face that they got divorced over Amelia not wanting kids and now she was having kids with someone else. She left. He chased her and apologized. She also apologized. She should have known that this was going to be a bigger conversation than she had anticipated. She told him that she really didn't want kids when they were married. Something changed in her and Betty and Leo were a big part of that. She wasn't ready before but she was now, and she had him to thank for that. She said they would always be family through Leo, which they both liked. He asked how they were going to handle this whole family thing. She admitted it was a complicated situation. He realized he had to go apologize to Cassidy for projecting his anger on her.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nOwen and Teddy showed up for Meredith's hearing before the medical commission while arguing about sleep training Allison. Owen testified to Meredith's outstanding surgical skills. He specifically cited Megan's case, though his testimony was weakened when the prosecution brought up Bailey's post-op notes from Megan's first surgery, which detailed Owen's serious doubts about Meredith's approach at the time. Later, Owen let in the group of patients who had come to testify on Meredith's behalf. After the hearing was over, he congratulated Meredith when it was announced she got to keep her license.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nWith Alex taking some personal time, Owen acted as interim Chief. He showed around [[Daphne Lopez]], an emergency medicine attending who was looking for a job in Seattle. She was also interested in Seattle Pres but Owen impressed her throughout the day. As she walked off, Richard commented on his trying to impress Daphne, warning that that was a slippery slope. Owen said he was happy together with Teddy. Richard asked if he had proposed yet. When Owen said he hadn't, Richard asked what he was waiting for.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nOwen and Richard came to Grey Sloan to help out after Meredith let them know a car had crashed into Joe's bar, injuring several of their residents. Owen worked with Tom and Jackson on [[Blake Simms]], who had a facial fracture. On his way to the OR, he complained to Teddy and Amelia about Tom being an ass to him once again. Teddy asked him to cut Tom some slack. While Jackson and Owen were operating, Tom came in to demand hourly updates. After he was gone, [[Hannah Brody]] commented Teddy could do so much better than that guy. Jackson pointed out Teddy was with Owen. Hannah blamed her mistake on the way Tom talks to Teddy. Jackson then asked Owen if he and Teddy had set a wedding date yet. Owen said he hadn't even proposed yet. After sending Hannah out to do an intake in the ER, Owen told Jackson that he was feeling a lot of pressure for the right proposal as it had to make up for the fact that he hadn't done it decades ago. Jackson pointed out wanting to be with her forever included the present. Just as Tom came in to check for an update, Owen caught a subtle sign of a CSF leak, which Tom fixed. After surgery, Jackson and Owen updated Blake's grandmother, who informed him that Tom had paid for her to move to Seattle with Blake because he wanted Blake so badly. Tom came over and thanked Owen for catching the leak. They shook hands. Afterward, Owen took Teddy to an on-call room and got down on one knee with his mother's ring, which she had given him the day Allison was born. He told her there was no perfect moment but he knew she was the perfect woman for him. She checked if he was proposing out of obligation, citing his pattern of feeling trapped by obligations and his fear of disappointing others. He told her he was starting a new pattern of loving her and their family. He then asked her to marry him. She accepted. They headed out and announced their engagement to their colleagues, with Tom watching the happy couple from a distance.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nOwen showed up at Grey Sloan to take Teddy to a surprise lunch to talk wedding plans. She confessed she had lost his mother's ring. They set out to find it, even checking the pipes in the sink. They got a call that Leo was vomiting in daycare and found out on his scan that he had swallowed the ring. As they waited for him to pass it, Teddy expressed guilt over having lost it. He suggested she wear a necklace with letters for each member of the family instead of the ring and keep that hidden away for special occasions.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThe next Monday, Owen arrived at work late and was told by Richard that Catherine had purchased Pac-North to shut it down after a fight with him. She had all personnel go to Grey Sloan to interview with Tom to keep their jobs. Tom kept Owen waiting. When Tom was done with the attendings and called in a second-year resident, Owen protested but Tom assured him he would be out in time for his wedding. At the end of the day, Tom did an elaborate phone call with Catherine while Owen was the only one still waiting. Amelia sat with Owen and reminded him that he stole Tom's girlfriend. She pointed out Owen got everything, a family included, leaving Tom lonely and in pain, so he should let Tom have this. Owen was in awe of her empathy. Later, he teamed up with the board members and they presented Tom with an ultimatum, which included hiring Owen and Richard back, threatening to quit if he didn't comply with their wishes. Tom was forced to agree.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Owen and Jo were operating together, she asked him what he would do if he were to find out Amelia's baby was his. She stressed it was just hypothetical but Alex ignoring her texts was making her consider worst case scenarios. Owen replied that it took him a long time to get to this place with Teddy and he wouldn't let anything screw that up. Later, Owen ended up on an elevator with Link and asked him how he was holding up with Amelia half-way through the pregnancy. He had noticed Amelia had missed some days at work. Holding back that the baby actually might be his, Link simply stated things were complicated but that the baby was healthy. Owen recalled feeling useless when Teddy was pregnant. He advised Link to listen and sympathize and keep trying to help even if he wasn't sure how.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nWhen a blizzard hit Seattle, Owen and Teddy left their kids with his mother so they could both help out in the busy ER. He managed to help save a pregnant woman and her baby. Unaware of Teddy having found out that Amelia's baby might be his, he sent her a text asking to go sledding as he headed home.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOwen eagerly started planning the wedding while Teddy's recent discovery left her less enthusiastic. Blissfully unaware, he forwarded Teddy a list of venues that his mother had compiled but Teddy suggested just getting a wedding planner, which he didn't want to. He asked her to look at the list, which might help her figure out what she wanted. Later, he ran into her and asked what was going on when she ignore him. She blurted out Amelia's baby could be his and asked what that meant for him. He didn't answer, which upset her. Owen took some time process the news. He made Teddy dinner and told her he had just been shocked by the news. He assured her she was not a replacement for anyone. He added that whatever happened, his answer would always be that he loved her and that they would figure out.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, Amelia found Owen and Teddy in a lounge and announced to them that Link was in fact the father of her baby. Owen was happy to hear that as they could all move forward now. Owen took part in Meredith's [[Pro Bono Surgery Day|pro bono surgery day]]. He turned down Jackson's invitation to come to the game with him. As he scrubbed in with Jo, he wanted to say he was sorry about Alex having left her. He invited her to come over if she ever felt like she needed company. At the end of the day, Owen found Teddy crying on a bench outside. He comforted her and asked what was going on. Instead of telling about her having slept with Tom, she told him about a rough case.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Richard had a public meltdown, Teddy had a busy day having taken over Maggie's cases, causing her to forget about her and Owen's appointment to try out wedding cakes. As Owen and Link operated together, Link admitted he was nervous about becoming a dad. Owen truthfully told him that parenthood was scary and that those worries wouldn't go away. At the end of the day, Owen took Teddy into a supply closet, where they started to make out. She told him she wanted to get married that weekend.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nThe morning of the wedding, Owen got into an argument with Tom as he had ignored his request for time off. Tom had only seen the subject line and had indeed ignored it as he thought the wedding was still months away, so he didn't think it was urgent. Owen then informed him the wedding was happening tonight, surprising Tom, who approved the time off. Owen headed into surgery with Maggie, where they received the news about Richard's cobalt poisoning. As the surgery neared its end, Owen received a voice mail from Teddy. He had Levi play it on speaker. It was Teddy moaning. Owen brushed it off as a wedding present meant for him. However, after surgery, he retreated to a supply closet and listened to the entire message, which revealed that Teddy was having sex with him. He heard how she told Tom that this was goodbye sex and that she was still marrying Owen. However, Owen called his mother and claimed he got pulled into an emergency surgery, calling off the wedding. He left Teddy in the dark, leaving her to find out from his mother after having gotten all dressed up.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nFarouk, Megan's son, ended up needing a heart transplant. When a heart became available, Owen, Teddy, and Cormac went to retrieve it. After their driver had a heart attack, they ended up dangling off a cliff. Desperate to save Farouk, Teddy climbed out with the heart and went to flag down a passing vehicle. After some time, Owen told Cormac to climb out so his sons wouldn't lose their father after already losing their mother. He also told Cormac that he'd promised Noah he'd help other soldiers end their suffering as he'd done with Noah. He made Cormac promise to do that for him. Once Cormac had climbed out, the car slid off the cliff with Owen and the driver still inside.<ref>[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]], x</ref>\n\n\nOwen was changed profoundly by his experiences in Iraq. When confronted by his former fianc\uee [[Beth Whitman]] after returning, she told him he didn't even look like himself anymore. She thought he looked hard.\n\nOwen was shown to be humble when he started working at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, known at the time as Seattle Grace Hospital. Owen's treatment of his patients was flawed due to the fact he was used to treating patients in a war zone, but not a civilian hospital. Derek and Mark originally planned to reprimand him for his subpar treatment, but when Owen openly acknowledged his shortcomings and asked Derek and Mark for feedback so he could improve as a civilian doctor, they abandoned their plan and opted instead to teach Owen so he could improve as a civilian doctor.\n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\n[[File:Crowenkiss.jpg|thumb|left|px|Cristina and Owen kiss.]] Owen managed to impress Cristina as soon as they met, having performed an emergency tracheotomy in the field with a pen, and later closing up the gash in his leg with a staple gun without any kind of anesthesia. Later the same night, Owen found Cristina lying outside the hospital, having been impaled through the abdomen by a falling icicle. He carried her inside and treated her, eventually removing the icicle, and the two bonded. After Owen had taken care of Cristina, Dr. Webber offered him a job, but Owen turned down the offer as he was expected to return to Iraq. He left the hospital that night, but not before surprising Cristina with a passionate kiss that left her completely taken aback.\n\nOwen returned to Seattle two months later, having been honorably discharged from the army, and took a job as the new [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Trauma Surgery at Seattle Grace. Cristina first avoided him, but after he had forgotten her name, calling her \"Christine\", she confronted him. Owen then told her about his platoon's demise and explained that while he remembered her name, that belonged to the past, and he was now living in the present. Owen then kept his distance to Cristina and tried to act professionally towards her, but couldn't hide his jealousy as Mark Sloan was constantly trying to hit on her, or his anger when he heard Sloan call her \"bad, cheap wine.\" Owen himself compared her to a single malt scotch. \n\nWhen Owen questioned Cristina's motives for doing surgery, she opened up to him and told him the story of her father's death, which encouraged Owen to start moving closer. However, after a patient who became special to Owen died, he found himself arguing with her outside Joe's and then kissing her passionately, almost violently. This caused the two to avoid each other again until Owen showed up outside her house on the doorstep and told her that he thought she was beautiful. A little later, Cristina was upset for not getting the solo surgery, so Owen took her to the vent in the boiler room of the hospital, which cheered her up and the two kissed.\n\nAs Owen's moods continued to swing, Cristina snapped at him and told him to stop his hot and cold act. Owen responded by asking her out, but in the evening he was so nervous that he went to get a drink, ultimately showing up on her doorstep hours late and drunk. Cristina was angry at first, but after Owen, who was standing in her shower fully clothed and shoes on, told her about his best and worst surgery ever, she softened and went into the shower with him. Owen then passed out and woke up the next morning, naked in Cristina's bed. At the hospital, he apologized to Cristina, telling her he normally doesn't pass out naked in other people's beds, but she plays it off and leaves. Later that day, he confronts her, asking her to give him another chance, which she did. \n\nAfter this, their relationship was mostly centered around stolen touches and glances from across the room and although they flirted, it stopped when Owen's secret ex-fianc\uee Beth appeared at Seattle Grace, where her father was admitted. This caused Owen to have a panic attack and Cristina calmed him down, which resulted in Owen falling asleep on top of her in an on-call room and Cristina smiling happily as she held him in her arms. Though Cristina was wary at first after learning of Beth's identity, she and Owen moved on and he soon confessed that he wanted to be around her for the rest of his life.\n\nCristina and Owen started spending nights together - though they still hadn't had sex - but were soon confronted by new problems: Owen's PTSD from his time in Iraq started to manifest itself as violent nightmares and hypnagogic hallucinations. Ultimately, one night Owen fell asleep next to Cristina in her bed, and the spinning blades of the ceiling fan above the bed reminded him of helicopter blades, which caused him to have a hallucination and strangle Cristina in the middle of a nightmare. Cristina was rescued by Callie, who was alarmed by the noise coming from the bedroom, and Owen woke up, having no idea what was going on. He then broke down crying and apologized profusely, and Cristina - despite Meredith and Callie's resistance - forgave him, saying his PTSD is a war wound and not his fault. Soon after this, they made love for the first time in an on-call room, but Cristina realized that she's afraid to fall asleep in his arms, and broke up with him. After this, Owen started to see Dr. Wyatt, who helped him express and name his emotions and recognize the triggers to his PTSD (such as the blades of the ceiling fan). As Owen was further torn apart by his feelings for Cristina which he couldn't express because he thought it would be cruel to do so, Dr. Wyatt taught him to use three-word sentences as substitutes to the three words he wanted to say the most (I love you). As Owen continued to avoid her and only spoke to her with brief three-word sentences, Cristina became more and more confused and annoyed. When she finally confronted him in front of the hospital, he gave her a list of the sentences he used and explained what the speaking in three-word sentences meant and told her that he was trying to make things right by letting her go. Cristina then told him to \"take care now\", one of the three-word sentences meaning \"I love you\" he used for her multiple times, and left.  \n\nAs his therapy progressed, Owen started to move closer to Cristina, but she seemed to withdraw, asking him about finally going to visit his mother and telling her that he was back from Iraq. This caused Owen to ponder things and he came to the conclusion that at heart, his problems were caused by his unfinished business in Iraq. He then told Cristina that he was returning to the army, but she gave no support to the idea, later telling him: \"I don't want you to die.\" She then convinced him to abandon the idea of returning to the army and go visit his mother with her instead. After seeing his mother, Owen was able to sleep without nightmares, and with the violent dreams now gone, he and Cristina decided to get back together.\n\nLater, Cristina was missing a cardio attending to teach her, so Owen brought over his fellow army surgeon, [[Teddy Altman|Dr. Teddy Altman]], as a gift for Cristina. Teddy began to mentor Cristina, and, after a rough start, the two got along well. As it turned out, however, Teddy's presence caused a lot of trouble for Cristina and Owen, as she and Owen had had feelings for each other in the army without the other knowing. After this matter was revealed, Cristina was willing to stand aside, but Owen assured her that he only wanted her. This caused Teddy to think about leaving the hospital, and Cristina, whose workaholic nature had been awoken by the motivation of working with Teddy, offered her an exchange in a panic: if Teddy stayed, she could have Owen. Teddy then told Owen about the offer and he confronted Cristina, telling her that their relationship matters and she doesn't get to toss him aside like that. Cristina, however, remained uncertain and eventually broke up with him, telling him that until he had made his choice, the two of them had no business together.\n\nThe triangle between Owen, Cristina, and Teddy wasn't settled until the hospital was invaded by the murderous gunman [[Gary Clark]]. Owen and Teddy made it out of the hospital with a patient, but after realizing that Cristina was still inside, Owen made his decision and ran back to the hospital to find her. He then found Cristina in an OR where she was operating on Derek, who had been shot earlier, with Jackson, Meredith, and April - and with Gary Clark holding his gun against her head, ordering her to stop operating. Owen then tried to distract the gunman from Cristina, even yelling at him as he was about to shoot her: \"That is the woman that I love. You shoot her, you touch her, and I will kill you!\" The situation became even more dangerous when Meredith stood up, ordering the gunman to kill her instead of Derek. As the barrel of the gun moved to Meredith, Owen jumped towards Clark, forcing the shooter to shoot him instead of Meredith. After the gunman had gone, Cristina, not knowing the extent of his injuries, urged Meredith to save Owen. Luckily, it turned out the bullet had only pierced his shoulder, and in the wake of the disaster, Owen and Cristina got back together. \n\nAfter the shooting, Cristina suffered from PTSD and Owen took care of her, eventually proposing to her. Not long after, they got married in front of all their friends in a ceremony held at Meredith's and moved in together, purchasing an old firehouse that they decorated. Cristina later found out that she was pregnant with their child. Owen was thrilled, but Cristina, not wanting to become a mother, told him that she was going to have an abortion. Owen tried unsuccessfully to talk her out of it and ultimately kicked her out of their home for failing to give him a voice in the matter. However, Cristina found herself unable to go through with the abortion without Owen's support, which alarmed Meredith, who, after telling him what sort of miserable future would await both Cristina and the child if she kept it, convinced Owen to let Cristina have the abortion. Owen held Cristina's hand during the procedure, but the moment seemed bittersweet and involuntary. \n\nIt soon became clear that Owen was not okay with it. He and Cristina grew apart, he became more and more distant and silent, until the situation finally exploded during Zola's birthday party. Owen and Cristina got into a huge argument in front of all of their friends, which ended with Owen accusing Cristina of killing their baby. After this, the situation only grew worse, and during a session with a marriage counselor, it became clear that they both failed to understand each other's point of view on the baby issue.\n\nOwen's discomfort and anxiety eventually led him to get drunk and having a one night stand with a patient's friend. He confessed his infidelity to Cristina, who had earlier suspected him of having an affair with nurse Emily Kovach, which completely devastated her. Owen moved out of the firehouse and Cristina started to plan to move to Minnesota and accept the fellowship offered at Mayo Clinic. However, before leaving, she slept with Owen one last time, forgiving his infidelity. \n\nAfter Cristina and the others had been rescued from the forest in the wake of the plane crash, Owen promised to take care of Cristina, who was in a psychosis. He took her to the firehouse and managed to get her to speak. After she had fully recovered, she left for Minnesota to pursue her fellowship, while Owen stayed back in Seattle to continue his role as [[Chief of Surgery]]. After Cristina's mentor, Dr. Thomas died, she returned to Seattle and tried to make efforts to reconcile with Owen. Due to a lawsuit against the plane company, Owen asked Cristina for a divorce, which would help the surgeons with their trial. Cristina then told Owen she wanted to try again and he agreed, but they still went through with the divorce for the sake of the lawsuit. Their newfound happiness was short-lived, however, as the arrival of -year-old [[Ethan Dawson]], with whom Owen bonded, made it very clear that Owen still wanted children. Cristina then realized that she would never be able to give Owen what he desires, so she left him during the superstorm that hit Seattle. \n\nAfter the storm, Owen and Cristina faced the tough challenge of staying apart, and even though they ended up having sex - more than once - Cristina was determined to stick to her decision. Upon realizing that they could never detach themselves from one another as long as they let things stay the way they were, Cristina suggested that they'd start seeing other people in order to let go of each other, and Owen reluctantly agreed. Later, during GSMH's fundraiser gala, Owen met [[Emma Marling|Dr. Emma Marling]], with whom he started flirting. Cristina, witnessing the situation, left the scene with a downhearted expression on her face, leaving Owen with the other woman. Emma and Owen's relationship becomes quite serious and they even consider moving in together. However, after another emotional encounter with Cristina, Owen breaks up with Emma realizing that he wants to have a future with a woman who shares an equal passion for surgery as she does for children. After he breaks up with Emma, Cristina tries to help him find someone else.\n\nCristina and Owen continued a deep friendship with each other until Cristina left for Switzerland.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nFollowing Cristina's departure, Owen focused on his work and was skeptical about getting back to the dating game, despite him and Callie constantly encouraging each other to do so. However, he soon began to bond with Amelia, of whom he felt protective after a distraught patient revealed her past drug-addiction to the entire hospital, upsetting and humiliating her. When Jackson and April's baby died, he held her hand as she opened up to him about her own deceased baby, and the two developed feelings for each other.\n\nHaving been out of the dating game for so long, Owen was hesitant about making a move on her. He was constantly cautious and nervous around her, stammering his way through discussions with her. It wasn't until Amelia - just as helpless as him - came to visit him with a bottle of water that he finally took action and kissed her. A little later, after some failed attempts, they slept together for the first time.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Amelia tells Owen to consider his options.]]\n\nProblems soon arose, however, as Amelia began to fear that mixing professional and personal lives together would eventually result in a disaster. After a risky procedure to which Owen had given his consent went wrong, Amelia freaked out, believing that he only sided with her because of his personal feelings, and ended the relationship. The two then spent the following year apart, due to Owen going on another tour in Iraq after Derek's death. He returned to find Amelia, to whom he had had to break the news of her brother's demise a year before, completely shut down, refusing to deal with her grief. Upon learning that she was on the verge of relapsing again, he helped her open up and deal with her emotions.\n\nThe two continued to grow very close, to the point where Amelia decided to propose to Owen, telling him that despite the fact that marriage may be too soon, she was sure that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> They got married immediately after getting engaged in front of their friends and family.\n\nOwen and Amelia's wedding bliss didn't last for long as they realized they had a difference in opinion about starting a family. Amelia felt that Owen was pressuring her to start a family, which she wasn't ready for. Their marital problems got so bad that Amelia didn't come home for weeks and avoided Owen at the hospital. After months of their marriage being on the rocks, Owen had enough and went to ask for a divorce from Amelia. Just as he was about to do so, he discovered that she had a brain tumor, which likely affected her judgment about their hasty marriage. Once the tumor was removed, Owen and Amelia amicably decided to get a divorce, as they didn't know which part of their relationship was not affected by her tumor, which had been growing for approximately ten years.\n\nAfter getting divorced, Owen spent some time away from Amelia and decided to foster a baby named Leo. However, he soon realized he was in over his head and sought help from Amelia, who later moved in to help him and also mentor Leo's birth mother, Betty, who was addicted to drugs. Owen and Amelia bonded over their new family. Eventually, Amelia told Owen she still had feelings for him, and they got back together. Their relationship seemed to be back on track until Teddy returned to Seattle and revealed that she was pregnant with Owen's baby. Amelia gave Owen time to consider his options, and he chose Amelia. However, after Betty and Leo went back with Betty's parents, Owen and Amelia started fighting again, leading to another breakup.\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nOwen and Teddy met while they both were army surgeons. Both developed hidden feelings for one another. Owen brought her to Seattle Grace-Mercy West as a present for [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], claiming her to be the \"cardio goddess\", and Teddy later works out that Owen brought her as a present for his girlfriend, appearing more surprised by the fact Cristina was his girlfriend. She later would admit that she believed that if Owen broke up with his (ex) fianc\uee, Beth, he would have called her. Upon finding out, Owen became conflicted and almost kissed Teddy in a closet, but realized that he loved Cristina. The two remained good friends even after Teddy left Seattle to work in Germany.\n\nUpon Megan Hunt's discovery, Teddy returned to Seattle to see Owen and support him.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref> While in Seattle, she, along with Megan and Evelyn, confronted him about his failing marriage. After a fight with Amelia, Owen kissed Teddy, but she backed away, not wanting to ruin their friendship. She then returned to Germany.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Owen and Amelia's marriage ended, they continued sleeping together. After one hook-up, Amelia told Owen to seek out Teddy, claiming that he was still thinking about her. Owen did what she told him to, arriving at Teddy's doorstep in Germany and declaring his love for her. After spending the day together, however, Owen ended up slipping that it was Amelia who told him to come. Upon hearing this, Teddy was angry and hurt, claiming that he had once again fooled her into thinking that they could actually be together. The two got into a fight that ended with Teddy kicking him out, refusing to speak to him anymore.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref> When Teddy found out she'd become pregnant during this tryst, she returned to Seattle to tell Owen.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref> She eventually told Owen she was pregnant during the wind storm, and they got along during her pregnancy even though they were both in relationships. Right before Teddy went into labor, she realized she loved Owen, while Owen realized he loved Teddy after several sessions of therapy. He told her he loved her just as she gave birth to their daughter, [[Allison Hunt|Allison]].<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nLater on, during a surgery, Jackson asks Owen if he's set a date yet, which he responds to by saying he and Teddy aren't engaged. Jackson is surprised by this, and Owen says he wants to marry her, but he's afraid the proposal won't be big enough to make up for the fact that he didn't do it years, even decades ago. Jackson warns him not to wait too long. Teddy also tells Amelia that PTSD is about patterns and that Owen has a history of fear of obligation, while Teddy \"showed up with a belly full of obligation.\" Amelia responds by saying he loves Teddy. Teddy says that Owen hasn't proposed yet, but Amelia says that if he felt trapped, he would've already proposed. Owen meets Teddy in a room and proposes to her with his mom's ring. Teddy begins crying, and she tells him that she doesn't want him to feel obligated to marry her. She wants him to break his patterns, not reinforce them. Owen replies by saying he's starting a new pattern of loving her. When they leave the room, they publicly announce their engagement, which is received with congratulations from both Link and Amelia.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy confessed to him that Amelia's baby might be his, expressing concern over what their relationship would be if it was his. Owen said nothing, which caused Teddy to walk away. Later that night, Owen cooked for Teddy and told her that his answer would always be that he loved her.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nOn their wedding day, Owen found out that Teddy had been cheating on him with Tom through an accidental voicemail. He called off the wedding with the excuse that he had a last-minute surgery.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n[[Beth Whitman]]\nOwen was engaged to a woman named Beth, but in the army, he broke it off in a two-line email. She was always too emotional and attached to everything & everyone for him to handle. When he visited Seattle Grace, he kissed Cristina but left (though he was single at the time).\n\n[[Emma Marling]]\nOwen met Emma during GSMH's fundraiser gala and began flirting with her after seeing Cristina flirt with another possible donor. During the evening, he found out that she is actually an [[attending]] [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|perinatologist]] from [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital|Seattle Pres]] trying to gain some money for her hospital by taking advantage of GSMH's gala, but he didn't seem to mind. At the end of the evening, she came to see Owen at the hospital.\n\nOwen and Emma kept in touch after the evening, and she even baked him banana bread for work, which caused Callie to begin teasing him by calling Emma his girlfriend. At first, Owen denied being in a relationship with her, but after it became clear to all that the two had something going on, he admitted dating her to a couple people. He didn't tell Emma about his history with Cristina, and she later found out about their past from her while visiting the hospital. Emma then realized that Owen wasn't ready to date just yet and said goodbye to him, telling him to call her when he's ready to move on. After talking with Callie and April and receiving some advice from Cristina, Owen eventually called her and told her he was ready to move on. They continued dating, and later Emma was offered a job at GSMH. Though Owen was excited about the idea, Emma turned down the offer, not wanting to work at the same hospital with Owen in case something bad were to happen between them.\n\nAs their relationship became more serious, Owen and Emma discussed getting a place together and the possibility of marriage. Emma told Owen of her plans to become a stay-at-home mom and raise her children. However, later that same day, Cristina came to the trailer drunk and she and Owen slept together. Owen broke up with Emma the next day, saying they wanted different things, but leaving out that he had cheated on her. Emma was devastated.\n\n\n[[Evelyn Hunt]]\nEvelyn is Owen's mother, with whom he has a close relationship. After returning from Iraq as a changed man, he initially refused to see his mother, instead of calling her once a week as if he were still in Iraq. The reason for this was that he feared that she would look at him like a ghost, as he was no longer the son she sent to war. Cristina, however, finally convinced him to meet her, and in the end, Evelyn still loved him as before.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\nOwen is also fiercely protective of his mother, as proven when he learned that she was dating a man young enough to be his brother.<ref>[[With or Without You]], x</ref> He also told Nathan Riggs to stay away from her, even punching him when he claimed that she was his family as well.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\n[[Megan Hunt]]\nMegan is Owen's sister, whose existence none of his co-workers and friends knew of until his feud with Nathan became apparent. He barely speaks of her but has revealed to Amelia that she was three years younger than him, smarter, funnier, and a better person than him. The two were apparently very close, as Megan was described as doing everything her older brother did, even following in his footsteps to med school.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nOwen and his sister met Nathan in med school, where the two men became the best of friends, almost brothers to each other. This also led to Nathan becoming romantically involved with Megan, enough to make him think of the Hunts as his family. He and Owen had a falling out, however, caused by Owen blaming Nathan for allowing Megan on a helicopter that disappeared, and hadn't seen each other for years until Nathan began to work at Grey Sloan Memorial. Whatever the specific connection and circumstances, Owen hates him with a fiery passion, enough to interfere with his work.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Megan is found alive and brought back to the United States, she confesses her brother the truth about her accident and how she was the first to cheat on Nathan, even scolding Owen when he expresses his disbelief about her willingness to forgive Nathan while he himself has cheated on Cristina. Owen, by this, understands how he wrongly hated his friend and how much, on the other hand, Nathan was a good friend by letting himself be hated without ever telling about Megan's faults. Owen has never objected the relationship between Megan and Nathan again.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x</ref>\n\n[[Leo Hunt]]\nLeo is Owen's foster son, whom he received soon after filing for foster-to-adopt. At first, he was very uncertain about having made the right decision, doubting his skills as a parent and fearing that he had forced it to happen. After some encouraging words from Amelia and Alex, however, he regained his confidence and began to get used to his new role as a parent.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nOwen and Derek were at odds as soon as they met: Derek was telling the wife of one of the men Owen had rescued from the limousine accident that her husband would never walk again, when Owen walks in, trashes Derek's prognosis and suggests therapeutic hypothermia, which could possibly make the man walk again. Derek wasn't too happy about the new guy's interference, so when Owen was given a job at Seattle Grace, Derek was very dubious about his new colleague. The two eventually bonded, however, as Derek gave Owen advice on how to deal with the unique relationship between Meredith and Cristina, and eventually, Derek, Owen, and Mark became friends. Owen even asked Derek to be his best man at his wedding. Derek was honored, but couldn't make it to the wedding because he spent the night in jail after speeding, but Owen didn't seem to mind that he wasn't able to attend the ceremony.\n\nAfter the plane crash and the death of [[Mark Sloan]], Derek held a grudge against Owen, as he blamed him for putting them on a poor plane that crashed. Cristina urged Derek to forgive him, but he was unable to do so, which eventually lead to Owen quitting. It was only after Cristina's interference that Derek realized the source of his anger. He went to apologize to Owen and told him that it wasn't him that he was mad at; it was Mark. Owen accepted his apology and advised him to let go of his anger.  \n\nWhen Owen began dating Amelia, Derek was very supportive of them. When he died, Owen, having lost yet another friend, left Seattle and joined another tour in Iraq in order to escape the feeling of loss. When he returned, he and Amelia mourned Derek together.  \n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMark took an instant dislike to Owen after Owen refused to allow him to do a consult on a burn patient. Shortly after, Mark was angered with him because he let [[Alex Karev|Karev]] use skin glue, and was complaining (with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]) that the patient could have lost half of his face. Despite this initial argument, Owen and Mark later bonded and were quite good friends until Mark's death.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nOwen and Callie were on good terms since the beginning, and Callie was one of the first people to notice the spark between him and Cristina. After an awkward encounter, when Callie found Owen standing naked in Cristina's bedroom after their failed first date, she and Owen bonded as they operated on Mark's penile fracture, and Callie even gave Owen advice on how to appease Cristina after the date fiasco.\n\nAfter Callie had stopped Owen from strangling Cristina to death in his sleep, Callie and Meredith didn't allow Owen to approach Cristina for a while, but after the incident had been forgiven, Callie and Owen stayed on good terms. After the plane crash, they became friends as they relied on each other during the bad times of their relationships. \n\n[[Ethan Dawson]]\nEthan, a -year-old boy, came to the hospital after a car accident that had left both of his parents in critical condition. He almost instantly bonded with Owen, who took care of him while his parents were in surgery. After his father Paul fell into a coma and mother Rachel died of a seizure, Owen comforted Ethan, and when he was rushed to the ER after overdosing on his grandmother Nancy's sleeping pills, Owen expressed deep, almost paternal concern of his wellbeing. When Nancy told Owen that she was considering giving Ethan into custody because she was not capable of taking care of him, he found himself considering whether he should adopt him. After asking (and receiving) advice from Meredith, Owen decided to go for it, but before he could proceed, Cristina managed to wake Paul, reuniting Ethan with his father. Owen then ordered them to be transferred to Seattle Pres for safety from a superstorm that was approaching Seattle.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith and Owen share a turbulent relationship and they often clash, mainly because of their different views on Cristina and what's best for her. After the strangling incident, Meredith was very protective of Cristina and had a lukewarm demeanor toward Owen for a long time. With time, however, she began to soften to Owen, and at his and Cristina's wedding, she finally accepted Owen and told Cristina that he was \"perfect\". \n\nAfter Owen allowed Cristina to quit being a surgeon in the wake of the hospital shooting, Meredith was furious at Owen for letting Cristina \"completely fall apart\". This led to a huge argument, with Meredith claiming to know what Cristina needs better than Owen, and Owen reminding Meredith that Cristina isn't her. After the argument, the two were on very cold terms. \n\nWhen Owen and Cristina had a fight over the abortion of their baby, Meredith said to Owen that she was raised herself by [[Ellis Grey|a Cristina]] and that the guilt of resenting her own kid would almost kill Cristina. Owen then decided to support his wife in her decision, although he didn't completely deal with it. In the wake of the abortion, Owen and Cristina were very distant, which eventually lead Cristina to fear that Owen was cheating on her. When she mentioned it to Meredith, she reassured her friend that it was highly unlikely that Owen was cheating. In the end, however, Cristina's fears became a reality, and Meredith advised Cristina to leave Owen, calling him \"a pig\". \n\nAfter the plane crash and Cristina's move to Minnesota, Meredith and Owen became closer again, as they both missed Cristina. After her return, Owen and Meredith were on good terms. Owen even turned to Meredith for advice during his inner struggle on whether he should adopt Ethan or not, and Meredith kindly listened to him and, surprisingly, encouraged him to proceed with the matter, even though she knew Cristina would never like the idea.\n\nAfter Cristina's departure, Owen and Meredith became friends, Meredith having promised to Cristina to look out for him. When he became moody following Nathan Riggs' arrival at the hospital, she was the only person he allowed near him, shutting even Amelia out. Meredith then became the first person to find out about Owen's secret sister.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nWhen Kepner showed potential as a trauma surgeon, Owen became her teacher, and when she had a hard time being the Chief Resident, he gave her advice on how to stop being an administrator and start being the leader. When April failed her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|boards]], Owen had to fire her, though he later realized what a mistake that was and flew all the way to Ohio to re-hire April. Since that, Owen and April have made a good team in trauma and have become friends, with Owen consoling and supporting her during her second pregnancy, and April being his best man at his wedding to Amelia. \n\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\n[[File:Owengeorgealex.jpg|thumb|right|px|Owen works with George and Alex.]]\n\nWhen George and Alex were on his service, he discovered that George got calmer under pressure and told him that trauma should be his specialty. He assigned George to his service for a month. George took a shine to Owen and vice-versa, and Owen hugged him upon hearing that he was joining the Army.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nWhen Owen came to work at Seattle Grace, Alex admired him but did not know whether to be on his side or Mark and Derek's. For a short while, he stayed on Owen's service but after discovering George's raw talent, Owen paid more attention to George and his relationship with Alex did not advance.\n\nAfter becoming chief of surgery at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]], Alex recruited Owen to improve the trauma department.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nIzzie took an instant dislike to Owen, after he stabbed six pigs for the residents to save, in order to learn to work with \"live tissue.\" She was not put on his service after that and neither really spoke to or about the other. After she recovered from her own neurosurgery, Hunt had her on his service but after losing their patient he told her that she can't be a patient and a doctor at the same time.\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nFollowing Meredith and Cristina's fight, Owen bonded with Derek and people began to warm-up to him. When Derek started to suffer from depression, Bailey sent Callie and Owen to the woods to bring Derek. Owen initially refused but when she started to stare him down he said, \"People don't usually say no to you, do they?\"\n\nAfter Owen became the [[Chief of Surgery]], Bailey gave him a hard time, but eventually, Owen won her over. When Owen talked about his infidelity with Meredith, Bailey overheard the conversation and later showed compassion towards Owen, telling him that \"You did a terrible thing. It doesn't mean you're a terrible person.\"\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nThe Chief took a liking to him when Owen first appeared, and now they are close friends.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nArizona and Owen are on good terms. When Arizona was suffering from phantom limb pain, Owen started to help her defeat the pain. When nothing else worked, he ordered Alex Karev to stab her in the prosthesis with a scalpel in the OR, which drove the pain away.\n\n\nOwen is a very skillful and innovative doctor, hardworking, quick-witted, and relentless. He has respect for his patients and demands the same from his residents and colleagues. His training as an Army trauma surgeon allows him to use even the most simple household objects (e.g. a ballpoint pen) as surgical tools, and he is known to improvise when facing a lack of proper equipment. As a surgeon he works hard, even working three days straight, and in addition to taking care of the ER, he also takes some general surgery cases every now and then. According to him, he became a doctor because he wanted to help people, and because no one could read his handwriting. \n\nHe attended [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard]] and completed his [[Resident|residency]] in [[General Surgery|general surgery]] at [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]]. He then worked at Maryland Shock Trauma, making quite a name for himself there, according to [[Richard Webber]]. Shortly after /, he joined the army and became an army trauma surgeon. During his time in Iraq, he saw and experienced terrible things that would haunt him for a long time, such as seeing many of his friends and colleagues get shot or blown to pieces. He stayed in Iraq until one day his entire platoon of  was killed in an RPG ambush, leaving him as the sole survivor, and he was honorably discharged from the army. He then returned to Seattle and took up the post of [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Trauma Surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], restoring it to a level one trauma center.\n\nAt first, Owen had some trouble with making a transition from Army field medicine to civilian traumas, and his aggressive course of treatment and unwillingness to ask help from the other attendings was frowned upon by Derek Shepherd and Mark Sloan, who quickly started calling him names, such as \"Rambo\" and \"Meatballer\". However, Owen quickly adjusted to working in a civilian hospital and learned to page help instead of doing everything himself. His surgical skills soon impressed his colleagues, and George described them as \"amazing\", while Callie described Owen as \"meticulous.\"\n\nOver the next few months, Owen also started teaching residents in trauma and how to work quickly and efficiently in hard circumstances. His teaching methods were rather unusual and slightly unorthodox, for example, teaching his residents how to work with \"live tissue\" by stabbing six pigs and asking his residents to save them. He also taught his residents to respect their patients and trust more on their own evaluation instead of always relying on attendings.  \n\nDuring Derek's depressed period, Hunt revealed as a second-year resident, he lost the parents of three children, and it haunts him every day. When Derek commented that he expected a story about Iraq, Owen stated that he doesn't talk about Iraq. He did, however, tell Cristina one story about Iraq: how he had once laid still on top of a severely mangled bomb victim for two hours, preventing him from bleeding to death, something that he described as his \"best and worst\" surgery.\n\nOwen's level-headedness and professionalism caught the eye of [[Chief of Surgery|Chief]] Webber, and Owen soon became his right-hand man, Webber putting him in charge of selecting both the winner of the resident solo-surgery and the chief resident. He also placed Owen in charge whenever the hospital faced a crisis or emergency, given his training in working under pressure. \n\nAfter Webber stepped down as Chief of Surgery after taking the blame for Meredith's tampering of the drug trial, he asked Owen to take over his position. Owen accepted the offer and became the new Chief of Surgery at Seattle Grace Mercy West, much to the surprise of his colleagues. At first, Owen was struggling with his new position, feeling deskbound, and it didn't take him long to start drinking, so Derek took him to his construction site and advised him to improvise. The next day Owen gave up his office, saying that from now on, his office would be wherever he was. Using a tablet-like device to manage the hospital, he was able to carry his office with him and free himself to work in the Pit and do surgeries. \n\nOwen's position as the Chief of Surgery was threatened, however, during the aftermath of the lawsuit. After doing everything in his power to prevent the hospital from going under, he and the plane crash survivors were able to buy the hospital with the help of the Harper Avery Foundation, and the doctors were nominated as the new Board of Directors. In their first meeting, Jackson Avery brought up the Foundation's recommendation to replace Owen Hunt as Chief of Surgery in order to \"increase the morale\". This recommendation was met with utter disgust by the other board members, but when Owen heard of the recommendation from Cristina, he was enraged and after an argument between him, Avery and Shepherd decided to quit, leaving the hospital in chaos. Cristina then made Derek apologize to him, and he agreed to return as Chief of Surgery if the ER would be reopened, a condition to which everyone agreed. \n\nOwen stayed on as Chief for about two more years until Derek's death made him realize he had grown tired of the job. He resigned from the position and went on another tour with April, after which he came back as the Head of Trauma. He held that position until voluntarily stepping down to give Teddy Altman said job, becoming a regular attending trauma surgeon.\n\nWhen Owen clashed with Tom, he resigned from Grey Sloan Memorial and was hired as Head of Trauma at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] under Chief Alex Karev. When Alex took personal leave, Owen acted as Interim Chief. The hospital was purchased by the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]] and closed for business. The entire staff interviewed for jobs at Grey Sloan and Owen was reinstated as Head of Trauma once again.\n\n\n*Owen holds a rank of Major in the U.S. Army.\n*Cristina took down her ceiling fan because Owen told her it's one of the triggers to his PTSD.\n*Owen went to Harvard before he commissioned in the Army.\n*Owen is left-handed.\n*He has a Yelp rating of . stars.\n*He has messy handwriting.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: Message of Hope]]</ref>\n*Owen has broken up all but two of the fights among the men since his first appearance. First, between Derek & Mark. Then, Alex & Avery (twice).

While he was in CT, the roof in there started leaking and the machine shorted out.\n\nHe thought he might not have surgery, but he ultimately agreed. In surgery, the ceiling caved in. He had to be covered and moved to another OR to finish his surgery. Because they were concerned about water and debris from the ceiling, they opened his incision wider and did a more thorough examination of his abdomen.

''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith and Rose discovered that the treatment had worked on [[Beth Monroe]], she told Meredith she should go tell Derek because it's the kind of news he'd want to hear from her. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nRose continued to scrub in on Derek's surgeries after their breakup. After she cut him in surgery, she decided to transfer to pediatrics. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\n\nEx-Fianc\ue\nA year before she met Derek, Rose was engaged, but she called it off because she and her fianc\ue wanted different things. The diamond was her grandmother's so she wore the ring around her neck on a necklace. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nRose started dating Derek after they became friends. They kissed after a surgery. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek decided to try things with Meredith, he told Rose and they agreed not to let it affect their professional relationship. However, when Meredith found out he had kissed Rose, she broke things off and he invited Rose to go to dinner with him. She accepted. ''(\"[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]\")''\n\nAfter five dates, Derek and Rose hadn't had sex because she wanted to wait until they were serious. She admitted to Lexie that she loves him, but she was trying to play it cool. ''(\"[[Where the Wild Things Are]]\")''\n\nWhen the [[Date and Tell]] policy was implemented, Rose asked what they meant. When she was informed that it only meant the highest level, she said she wouldn't need one. However, she later asked for one. They slept together that night. ''(\"[[The Becoming]]\")''\n\nDerek started avoiding Rose after they had sex, though he claimed it was just because he lost a patient. At the end of the day, Rose blew him off because she thought he was ignoring her because they'd had sex. However, Derek convinced her that he wasn't and they left together. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\nHe and Rose continued dating but after saving their first clinical trial patient, he and Meredith kissed. He left to break up with Rose. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nAlthough she initially took it well, she then decided she hated Derek and became very unpleasant towards him. She pretended she was pregnant. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]\")''\n\nShe also carelessly handed him instruments in surgery, accidentally cutting him. She realized she was only damaging her reputation and left for an opening in [[Pediatrics|pediatrics]]. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nDespite being [[Derek Shepherd|Derek Shepherd's]] ex-girlfriend, and because of the fact that she felt intimidated by Meredith's legendary relationship with Derek, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] and Rose actually got along well. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] and [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] disliked her.\n\n\nRose received her education from Santa Cruz, (most likely University of California, Santa Cruz) and majored in computer science for three semesters before switching over to nursing to become a scrub nurse. Derek Shepherd insulted her education by stating Santa Cruz has a reputation as a \"party school.\"\n\nShe was the attending nurse for over  of Derek Shepherd's surgeries before he ever learned her name, as Rose stated after they operated on [[Danny Metcalf]]. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\nWhile she initially took the break up well, she eventually held feelings of resentment towards Derek. After their break up and after carelessly handing Derek a scalpel in surgery,\uashe accidentally cut his hand, causing it to bleed. This led her to realize that she was no longer the scrub nurse everyone wanted, and transferred to a job in pediatrics.

His father was abusive and his mother was schizophrenic. He also spent time in foster care. Before ending up in foster care, Alex acted as a dad to Aaron.\n\n\nAaron came to [[Seattle]] and paid Alex a visit almost seven years after Alex last came home. He showed him his hernia, which Alex guaranteed would be repaired after he got [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Bailey]] to agree to a pro-bono surgery for him. When Aaron found out through [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] and [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] that Alex had gotten married and was going through a divorce, Aaron was livid at Alex for not telling them. The two brothers clashed and fought in the hospital. Aaron tried to back out of the surgery, but ended up having it anyway. They later reconciled and Aaron left. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\")''\n\n\nMonths later, Aaron was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After he tried to kill [[Amber Karev|Amber]], Alex returned to Iowa because he was the only one in the family of legal age and mentally fit to have him committed for treatment, since their mother was also schizophrenic and was off her meds. ''(\"[[Something's Gotta Give]]\")''\n\n\n\nAccording to him, his young sister, Amber, is smart like their older brother, Alex. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\")''\n\n\nAaron is a mover.\n\n\n*When Cristina met him, she thought he was nice, so she nicknamed him \"Angel Spawn\".\n*Although Aaron introduced himself with the surname Karev, [[I Bet It Stung|it was later revealed]] that Karev is his mother's maiden name, and, like [[Alex Karev|Alex]], likely chose to dissociate himself from their father, [[James Evans]], and presumably had it legally changed.\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:Aaron Karev]]\n[[fr:Aaron Karev]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Karev, Aaron}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He has two siblings, an older sister, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]], and a younger sister, [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]].\n\n\n\nMeredith found out she was pregnant three weeks into her pregnancy, a few months after [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] died. She told Derek by buying a shirt for Zola that said \"World's Best Big Sister\". At first, she was convinced that she would miscarry, which is why she only told him, and not even [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]].\ua''(\"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith went into labor in the middle of a super storm. The labor was going smoothly until the OB determined that the baby had face presentation. He was then born via emergency c-section in the dark during the storm. In the operating room, the doctors had to hold flashlights so that [[Connie Ryan|Connie]], the OB, could see to deliver him. After he was born, his breathing was shallow and his sats were low, so he was taken to the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]] to be monitored and receive oxygen. After he was born, [[Shane Ross|Shane]] noticed that Meredith had suffered from a massive splenic hemorrhage caused by her fall down the stairs. [[Miranda Bailey]] performed surgery to stop the hemorrhage and saved Meredith's life, thus Meredith named her son after her.\ua''(\"[[Perfect Storm]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Meredith was attacked by a patient, [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] and [[Alex Karev|Alex]] brought Zola, Bailey, and Ellis in to see her. However, the three of them were too scared by her appearance and the visit was brief. After she had recovered, the family was happily reunited at home. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n\nFor his fifth birthday, he wanted a superhero party. After Alex had to back out of helping set up the party to operate on a patient and the entertainment cancelled, [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]] offered to help her. They set up the party and Link even pretended to be Thor when Bailey asked if he was. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]] died, he left presents for Ellis, Bailey, and Zola in his closet. Meredith took those presents to her kids and told them about their grandpa. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Zola caught [[Andrew DeLuca]] trying to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night, Meredith sat Bailey and his\uasiblings down with ice cream and told them that Andrew was at the house because the two of them were dating. Bailey asked Meredith if she would kiss Andrew, to which she said she probably would. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\n\nJust before Meredith decided to turn herself into the police for committing insurance fraud, she sat Bailey, Zola, and Ellis down and told them that she would be gone for a while. Bailey asked where Meredith was going, and she said she had to take care of something very important. She didn't give them details, but assured them that Alex, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], and [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] would be there for them. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was doing community service, Bailey found her vest and asked if he could wear it to school. She told him no, saying she needed it to go to work. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\n\nHe dressed as a football player for Halloween. Meredith was released from jail that day and missed trick or treating with them, but got home in time to help them sort candy. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, Bailey stayed home with his sisters, Amelia, Link, and his new cousin, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] while his Mom treated COVID patients at the hospital and eventually became sick with COVID- herself and had to be admitted. He had an exceptional amount of energy during this time, making Link comment that he needed some kind of outlet for it. When Amelia realized she'd missed Link's birthday, she convinced the kids to watch a movie by saying it was Link's birthday wish, giving them some free time. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nFor his birthday that year his Mom asked him what he wanted and he told her he wanted a big cake all to himself. His Mom bought it for him and at his birthday party he stuck his face right in the cake and then licked the icing off his fingers and made a big production of it. This made everyone who was at the party: his sisters, his Mom, Amelia, Link, and Maggie laugh. Meredith realized that that\us what he really wanted for his birthday was to make them all laugh because at the time the COVID- Pandemic was all over the news and his cousin Scout who was just a baby was keeping all of the adults in the house up all night. As a result, no one in the house was laughing much. His Mom said he looked just like his father Derek the way he lit up. (\"[[Breathe]]\") \n\nShortly after Andrew died, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis had a dance party in the backyard while the grieving adults supervised and tried to figure out how to tell the kids, who had loved Andrew. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nBailey and Ellis stayed home with Maureen while Maggie took Zola to the hospital to see Meredith in the hopes it would help encourage her to wake up. While they were gone, Bailey and Ellis made a fort. When Link and Amelia returned, they asked to be let into the fort. Bailey and Ellis denied them entry without the password. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her pulmonary studies showed a remarkable improvement in her lung capacity and her labs came out clear, Meredith was discharged from the hospital. Instead of leaving to a fanfare, she had Jackson slip her out the back and drop her off at home, where her kids greeted her happily. Because she hadn't told anyone she was coming, the kids' welcome home poster was unfinished, but she appreciated it anyway and asked her kids to tell her everything that had happened while she was gone. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn August , Bailey attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. However, at the wedding, Maggie's father and Winston's grandmother opposed the wedding, wanting to wait until more people could attend, so the wedding was postponed. In April , a new wedding was planned and they all attended. Bailey walked down the aisle with his mother and siblings to spread flower petals at the start of the ceremony. During the reception Bailey, along with both of his siblings, held engagement rings for Link as he proposed to Amelia on the beach after the ceremony. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nAfter working with Addison on a surgery and talking to her about Derek, Meredith invited Addison to her house to meet her kids. They were happy to meet her and asked if she was a friend of their dad's. She said that she was and they immediately got along. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith got stuck in Minnesota when snow caused her flight to be canceled, Amelia was left to cook the meal alone as well as care for all four children by herself. When Link came to drop off Scout and learned this, he decided to stay and help. When he discovered that the oven wasn't on and the turkey was not cooking, he helped her change the meal plan. The kids happily ate the replacement meal when Link said he'd pardoned the turkey. While they ate, Zola asked what an AVM was and Amelia explained. Bailey then asked what sex was, shocking the adults.\n\nAfter dinner, Link and all four kids had a dance party. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\n\nAs Christmas approached, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis helped their mother decorate a Christmas tree at their house. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith traveled to Minnesota to finish up the report on Hamilton's surgery and then spend the weekend with Nick, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis spent the weekend with Maggie and Winston. While fighting with Ellis over a stuffed animal, Bailey ended up cutting his knee. Winston told the kids they were going to play Emergency Room and Zola helped him clean and bandage Bailey's knee. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith returned home from her trip to Minnesota to present Hamilton's case to the staff at the Mayo, Nick came with her. They brought pizza to her house and he met her three children. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith held a dinner party at her house so that everyone could get to know Nick better, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis attended the party. While they waited for dinner to be ready, they played in the backyard with Amelia and Kai and then played hide and seek. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nBailey went trick or treating with his siblings and cousin, Scout, on Halloween. He dressed as Iron Man. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\nWith the move incoming, the whole family started preparing for the move. When a lightning storm hit, Maggie and Winston stayed at the house with the kids packing things while Meredith worked. They told the kids to stay inside, despite Zola noting the low odds of them being struck by lightning. Later, the kids were scared when lightning struck the house, starting a fire. They quickly evacuated and were reunited with Meredith outside as they watched the firefighters of [[SFD Station |Station ] try to put out the fire. Meredith assured them that what was most important was that they were all safe.

Meredith was worried about the visit because she didn't have any examples on how to be a good mom. During the meeting, she talked about Zola's surgeries, but believed she hadn't left a good impression. Janet assured her that a good mom brags about her kids and that's what Meredith did, even though her day involved surgery and not play groups. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\nShortly after the interview, Janet came to the [[The Dream House|unfinished house]] they were building to see it. At the end of the day, she told Meredith she'd been granted temporary custody of Zola, who was being released from the hospital. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Janet visited the hospital day care to see how Zola was doing, she was surprised to see Meredith there. When [[Daycare Worker Tara|Tara]] came up and asked Meredith if she was planning to take Zola home as Derek was on the schedule to pick her up that day, Janet became suspicious. She looked into it and found out that Meredith had also been fired from the hospital. Panicked, Meredith took Zola and hid. ''(\"[[Free Falling]]\")''\n\nAfter speaking to social services about her concerns, she informed Derek and Meredith that she'd have to remove Zola from their custody while her concerns were evaluated. ''(\"[[She's Gone]]\")''\n\n\nZola was brought into the ER when she had a seizure. Janet informed [[Alex Karev|Alex]] that he couldn't tell Meredith and Derek that Zola was in the hospital because it was a conflict of interest. Despite this, he told them, but [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] managed to talk them out of going to see her, because Janet knowing that they knew could jeopardize the adoption. Zola's surgery was successful, but Janet saw Derek and Meredith in the elevator at the end of the day, looking upset, tipping her off that they knew that Zola had been in the hospital. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith became upset at the lack of progress in Zola's adoption, so she e-mailed Janet. She was upset to find out that Janet was out of the office for the week. After Alex visited the office of social services and later spoke directly to the judge, Meredith got an e-mail telling her that they had a hearing date. ''(\"[[Put Me In, Coach]]\")''\n\nHowever, Janet later called to inform Meredith that their hearing date had been cancelled. She said it either meant that they loved Meredith and Derek and they were giving Zola to them or they weren't going to get Zola back. And Janet hadn't gotten a call saying that they were getting Zola back. She advised Meredith and Derek to think about moving on. ''(\"[[Dark Was the Night]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting for the pizza she ordered, Meredith and Derek agreed that they'd be happy with just the two of them. When the doorbell rang, Meredith thought the pizza was there and left the kitchen to pay the dellivery guy. Instead of the pizza delivery guy, she saw Janet and Zola standing in front of the door. \"Derek, is that our baby?\" she smilingly asked him. Derek quickly came over too and opened the front door. Janet then gave Zola to Derek and confirmed that Zola was officially theirs.\ua''(\"[[Suddenly]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]] and [[Derek Shepherd]]\nShe was on Derek and Meredith's adoption case for Zola.\n\n\nJanet is a social worker who was on Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd's adoption case.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxSocialWorkerJanet.png|[[I Will Survive]]\nxSocialWorkerJanet.png|[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\nSocialWorkerJanet.png|[[Free Falling]]\nSocialWorkerJanet.png|[[She's Gone]]\nSocialWorkerJanet.png|[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\nSocialWorkerJanet.png|[[Suddenly]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Janet Meyers Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Meyers, Janet}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

You're one of the Seattle Grace Five. [You survived a plane crash] And a car crash. And a shooting. You might be immortal. You mastered one of the most exclusive specialties basically overnight, and then you took Herman's job and her eyesight. You have screwed dozens of interns, and you got them all fired. You speak really fast, like superhuman fast. You have a weird name... They say you have two legs, and you are only pretending that one is amputated. For the parking space.|'''[[Stephanie Edwards]]''' to '''[[Arizona Robbins]]'''}}\n\n'''Arizona Robbins''' is the former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Fetal Surgery]], an [[Attending]] [[Pediatric Surgery|Pediatric Surgeon]], and a board director at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She is the ex-wife of [[Callie Torres]] and the mother of [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]]. To better the happiness of her daughter, she decided to move to New York to be closer to Callie.\n\n\n\nArizona was named after the battleship, the U.S.S. Arizona, on which her grandfather served and died after saving  men. She came from a military family, her father being a Colonel in the United States Marine Corps. Her brother later joined the army and died because there weren't enough doctors.\n\nWhen she was growing up, she moved every  months due to her family's involvement in the military. Whenever they would get somewhere new, her father would take her skating first thing. Wherever they ended up, the skating always stayed the same, which made her feel safe. She did it in college, in med school, and when she first got her job at Seattle Grace. She noticed the skating made the kids feel at ease, too.\n\nThe way she described her upbringing is that she was \"..raised to be a good man in a storm. Raised to love my country. Love my family. Protect the things I love.\" It led her to be patriotic as well as loyal and dedicated in her adult life, especially to her family.\n\nShe learned to act tough when she had to, due to her name, and she never had to \"come out\" to her parents because it wasn't a shock to them. She had a poster of Cindy Crawford in her room and she wasn't looking at her beauty mark. She never brought any boys home and when she finally brought home a girl, Joanne, her mother wasn't surprised. She had expected her father to react by saying \"How fast can you get the hell out of my house?\" but instead he asked her \"Are you still who I raised you to be?\".\n\nShe attended [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]].\n\nDuring her [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]], she was a \"full-on horror show\". She was later chosen as Chief Resident for her th and final year of residency.\n\n\nAfter completing her [[Resident|residency]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], Arizona was hired as a [[Fellow|surgical fellow]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace Hospital's]] [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery department]]. When [[Attending#Department Head|head]] pediatric surgeon [[Jordan Kenley]] died, Arizona was promoted to department head and took over Dr. Kenley's cases. She worked together with [[Alex Karev]] and [[Miranda Bailey]] on [[Jackson Prescott]], a young boy dear to Bailey. They disagreed when Arizona wanted to change Dr. Kenley's course of treatment. Arizona thought it wasn't working, though Bailey fully supported Kenley's plans. Arizona agreed to follow Kenley's course of treatment for another day, but did want to explore other options. She told Bailey they'd meet in the OR as she rolled off on her Heelys, which made Bailey start to dislike her.\n\nThe dislike grew in the OR where Arizona said that it was a miracle that Jackson was still alive, as he should've been on the transplant list a year ago. Behind Arizona's back, Bailey complained about her to Richard, though he didn't really listen and he assured her that Arizona was the best. When Arizona told Bailey after surgery to put Jackson on the transplant list, Bailey asked to get a second opinion. Arizona gave her [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Wish You Were Here|Norman McCale's]] number, saying he'd totally agree with her plan. Bailey said there was no need to snap, but Arizona found there was. Arizona said that she got that Bailey kept on second guessing her as she liked and trusted Kenley, but she said that she was not the problem. She asked Bailey to start thinking about Jackson instead of her, as he needed all the time he could get. Bailey later realized that Arizona was \"okay\", which she also told the Chief, to whom she had earlier complained.<ref>[[Wish You Were Here]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] was asked by another hospital at Boise to send over a couple of surgeons to assist the surgeons at Boise with a surgery to separate conjoined twins, a surgery the doctors in Seattle had successfully completed [[This Magic Moment|earlier that year]]. Originally, Alex was on the plane to Boise to represent [[Pediatric Surgery|Arizona's department]], but then Arizona heard that he had chosen to take the fellowship at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]] instead of staying in Seattle to study under her. She was furious, scolded him and yelled at him, saying that he could no longer represent the hospital. She took his place on the plane and pulled him off every single pediatric case before she left. During their flight, the back of the plane broke off and the plane crashed in the woods.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after the crash, Arizona was lying next to the front part of the wreckage and she kept on screaming until Cristina yelled at her to shut up. Arizona then points Meredith, Mark, and Cristina into the direction of a consistent banging sound, which turned out to be Lexie, who was crushed under a part of the plane, banging a belt against the metal. While the others went away, Arizona sat up and tore open her pants, revealing she had an open femur fracture. She was panicking when the pilot asked if there was someone there. He told her he couldn't move. She told him her name and instructed him not to move, as he could injure himself even more. She informed him that she thought they were all alive and then started laughing because she was in shock. When he told her he couldn't feel his legs, she suddenly stopped laughing, and he said he knew that was bad. \n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Arizona splinting her leg.]]\n\nLater on, Cristina came back and sought supplies to help splint Arizona's leg. Arizona told her she could do it herself, which she did, but asked Cristina to take a look at Jerry, the pilot of the plane, who was found to be paralyzed. When Cristina yelled, \"I found it!\", Arizona thought she found the first aid box, but Cristina was talking about her shoe. Arizona then looked at her hand, and noticed there was dry blood on it. She then coughed up blood again. In the evening, Cristina, Meredith, and Derek dragged Mark's body back to the front part of the plane. Mark then informed Arizona that Lexie died. When Arizona was asking Jerry about the  hours he mentioned earlier, a helicopter passed over the woods, and she screamed along with the others, but it didn't help. While she was out in the woods, Alex left her a message to tell her that he chose to go to Hopkins to see if he was something without her around. When it got dark, Mark told her that he was ready to go to Lexie, but Arizona convinced him to fight to stay alive as she, Callie, and Sofia were waiting for him. Back in Seattle, Callie was dressed in sexy lingerie, waiting for Arizona to come home.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:xArizonaRobbins.png|thumb|px|Arizona makes Callie promise not to cut off her leg.]]\nAfter four days in the woods, Arizona and the others were taken to the hospital in Boise, where scans were taken of her leg. While the Chief in Boise recommended amputation, Arizona interfered and told Owen she gave no one permission to cut off her leg. Following her request to go to Callie, she and the others were sedated and put on a plane to Seattle, where Callie started taking care of the infected leg. After Bailey's visit with Sofia, Arizona realized her future was uncertain. The thought of an amputation came back in her head, which scared her so much that she urged Callie to come up with a plan to save the leg and she made her promise that she wouldn't cut if off, and so Callie did. Callie did come up with a plan to save the leg and although Owen mentioned a prosthetic would give Arizona a much better quality of life, the surgery was planned. However, when Alex visited Arizona, she started crashing because of the infection. He did everything he could, but she kept deteriorating. He went to Callie, who was in the middle of the surgery on Derek's hand, and she ordered him to cut off the leg and do his best at it. After the surgery, Callie held Arizona's hand until she woke up.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nAfter her left leg was amputated, Arizona became depressed. When Mark died  days later, Callie went into her bedroom, where Arizona was just sitting in bed, and she told Arizona that she couldn't keep doing things alone. She yelled at Arizona to get out of bed and \"snap at out this\". While Callie was ranting over how Sofia lost a parent and she lost her best friend, Arizona turned towards Callie. \"Snap out of this? Snap out of ''this''?\" Arizona said while she revealed her residual limb. \"How the hell am I supposed to snap out of this when you cut off my leg?\" Arizona says. She then turns her back towards Callie again, while Callie left her alone.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Arizona blames Callie for making her decisions.]]\n\nSome time later, Callie told Arizona, who was back at home in a wheelchair, about the settlement the survivors were offered by the plane company. While she kept on talking about how good the settlement would be for them, Arizona ignored her and didn't respond, and even pulled away when Callie tried to make physical contact with her. The next day, Callie told Arizona she should come to the settlement meeting to make her own decision about whether or not she wanted to take it. Arizona started sniping that she didn't need to be there, as Callie was there and that Callie took other decisions for her, too, like the one to cut off her leg. Callie came home to get Arizona for the meeting anyway, only to find her sitting in a pool of her own urine in the bathroom, having fired the homecare nurse for not liking her. Arizona blamed Callie that Callie's decision to cut off her leg made her unable to go the toilet on her own. Against her will, Callie picked her up and put her in the shower, and made it clear that Arizona's problems were her problems too, as they lived together. Without Arizona, she went to the meeting, where it was decided not to take the settlement.<ref>[[Love the One You're With]], x</ref>\n\nArizona agreed to go to the hospital to fit a prosthetic, but only if no one knew about it, though Callie accidentally told Alex because she thought he had seen Arizona. Meanwhile, Arizona was introduced to her prosthetist, [[David Moore]]. He took a look at her residual limb, commenting that it was healing well as there was no scar tissue. Later, he was putting plaster bandages on Arizona's residuum when Callie came in, thinking Arizona would be ready. Arizona yelled at her for not checking her voicemail, where she left her a message. The next day, Arizona tried on her first prosthetic. Without checking it first, she told him it was fine. He told her not to rush and tried to get her up to take a few steps, but she yelled to let her go when he tried to help her up. He made it clear she still needed help with her leg and that she should let the people in her corner help her. He then went away to do other work and left her alone to give her some time. While she was alone, she tried to take a few steps when Alex came in. She fell, but he caught her. He then took a look at her left leg too and told her they needed her back in her department. \"I'm trying,\" she says. Before he left, he told her Callie was trying too. When David got back, Arizona was standing in front of a mirror. She then gave him some remarks about the prosthetic and he told her he'd do something about it. At the end of the day, Arizona allowed Callie, who was ready to go back to Mark's place, to sit next to her on the couch to watch American Bake Off together.<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n[[File:xArizonaleg.jpg|thumb|xpx|Arizona being fitted for a prosthetic leg]]\nHearing how Callie was struggling with Arizona, Bailey planned to get Arizona back to work. She used a difficult case to lure Arizona out of her apartment and to the hospital. With fake promises to deliver the patient's chart, she managed to get Arizona walking to the door of her apartment. As the chart wasn't there, Arizona was angry and called Bailey, who promised her to check with happened with the chart. She didn't hear back from Bailey, she left an angry message, which was all part of Bailey's plan. When Bailey didn't reply, Arizona left her apartment to go the hospital and get the chart herself. While Bailey confessed to Callie that she may have pushed Arizona too hard, they saw her walking in the hallway. Bailey told Callie to hide, as her presence would mean too much pressure. Arizona walked over to Bailey, and when she saw the chart, she came up with a possible diagnosis. She informed Bailey on the disease, who was actually just playing stupid to make Arizona feel comfortable at work again.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Arizona returns to work.]]\n\nOn Arizona's first day back at work, Callie urged everyone not to make a big deal out of it and unbeknownst to Arizona, she put [[Heather Brooks]] on wheelchair duty, so Arizona would have a wheelchair nearby when she wanted to sit down. Despite everyone's efforts not to make a big deal out of it, like Alex paying a kid not to ask her about the fake leg, there were some comments about her return and prosthetic, like Bailey mentioning her first surgery was a lot of standing for her first day back. Arizona also walked slower with her walking stick than other doctors, like Alex, who could still run. When they got paged to the ER, Arizona told Alex to run and that she'd follow. While walking to the ER, Arizona noticed Heather with the wheelchair and asked if she could help her, but Heather talked herself out of it with an excuse. When Arizona finally arrived in the ER, April and Alex had already taken the kid to [[Computed Tomography|CT]]. After surgery, Arizona was so proud of herself for getting through the day and completing the surgery that she put all her weight on her left foot, which caused her to fall down. Alex was really worried and sent everyone out to give her some time, but she just laughed about it. After work, Callie came home where she saw Arizona having a little dance party with Sofia, and Arizona told her about her good day.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n\nDespite being asked to be a bridesmaid, Arizona didn't want to go to Bailey's wedding because she wouldn't be able to wear high heels, and flats make her feel less feminine and confident. Callie tried to cheer her up, but it didn't really work. Callie then acknowledged the wedding would just be another reminder of the leg, but told her she was still more beautiful than the other women at the wedding. The next day, moments before leaving for the wedding, Arizona confessed she still wanted to stay home. Callie was angry and told her that the wedding would be all about Bailey and not about the leg, which it had been all about for the past five months. Arizona then put her flat shoe on her prosthetic foot and they left for the wedding, where they waited for Bailey. When Callie confessed she told Bailey she could flee from the wedding, Arizona thought it was a reference to their marriage and was a little offended.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nWhile waiting for Bailey to come to the wedding after the surgery, Callie assured Arizona that her comment to Bailey was just a joke, but this made Arizona think about their marriage. She booked them a room in the hotel where the wedding was organized, and they went there with some mac and cheese cupcakes from the buffet (for in case they worked up an appetite). After preparing the room to get intimate, they confessed they were both nervous. They kissed, but Arizona then said she wanted to take her leg off first while Callie waited in the bathroom, as she wanted the evening to be all about sexy and taking off her prosthetic leg wouldn't be so sexy. Callie thought she was joking at first, but she did what Arizona asked her to when she noticed how serious she was. However, Arizona didn't take off her leg and apologized when Callie came back into the room. She apologized, but she wasn't ready to get sexy again. They ordered champagne to eat with the cupcakes while watching an old movie together. While watching the movie, Arizona suddenly asked Callie not to run, saying she knew she was horrible and that she was finally starting to feel like herself again. She also said that she didn't want everything to be about the leg all the time, and that she couldn't lose Callie. \"So please, don't run,\" Arizona asked her wife. Callie promised her that there was no way she was going to leave Arizona's side, and Arizona then proposed a good old fashioned junior high makeout. After their makeout, they sneaked back to the wedding, where Bailey and Ben were performing their opening dance.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Arizona had a dream about leg falling apart in hundreds of pieces. She suffered from phantom limb at night, but when it started to happen during the day too, she didn't want to talk to Callie about it. During a surgery, Arizona's leg kept on hurting, forcing her to leave the OR. She went to a lounge, where she took of her prosthetic. [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] and [[Alana Cahill]], the physician advisor, came in, and Arizona assured them she was fine. Owen asked Alana to leave them alone, and Arizona though Alana would have her fired, as she hadn't been very efficient lately. Arizona thought she was going crazy, as she felt pain in a part of her that no longer existed, but Owen assured her phantom limb was a very real thing. He took a mirror out of a closet and placed it in between her legs, so she could visualize a leg that didn't hurt. In the army, he had seen phantom limb before and know some ways to ease the pain, the mirror being one of them. It helped a little, and Owen asked her what Callie said about it. Arizona confessed that she hadn't told Callie, as she wanted to be Callie's wife again after having been her patient for so long. She also didn't want her life to get screwed over by something that wasn't even there. Owen then promised he would help her to figure it out. She later met with Alana, who understood that she was having a moment.\n\n\nOn the day of the judgment about the plane crash, Arizona interrupted Derek's ping-pong game to inform him that the lawyer called to tell that they had to meet at the courthouse. The hospital was found negligent, and each of the survivors was granted  million dollars. The doctors, Arizona in particular, weren't extremely happy about the award and went back to work. Throughout the day, Callie planned a \"survivor's dinner\" to celebrate that they won the case. They called a sitter for Sofia and went to the dinner, where Callie celebrated that Arizona stood up for  hours and that they were all still alive. They also toasted to celebrate Meredith's pregnancy. Back at the hospital, Owen found out the insurance company wasn't going to pay, because with Arizona having taken Alex's place on the plane, there were more attendings on the plane than are normally allowed. This would mean the hospital had to pay the awards for the doctors itself, but since there wasn't enough money to do so, the hospital would go bankrupt.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile attending Meredith's [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|baby shower]], Arizona noted how glowy the pregnant Meredith looked. She then turned to Callie and suggested they have a second baby, as it would be nice to have something new and happy to think about. She suggested that she carry the baby this time and a surprised and enthusiastic Callie agreed.\n\nThey soon started to look through several sperm donors and eventually decided on an Ivy League poet, smart and creative. They were drinking wine while Arizona asked Callie if she was going to like being pregnant, and Callie said it's the best, aside from numerous disadvantages, like no drinking. Arizona then jokingly said goodbye to her glass of wine.\n\nSoon after, Arizona was inseminated. When her period was one day late and her breasts started to hurt, Arizona took a pregnancy test and found out that she was in fact pregnant. She told Callie that they were having a baby when Callie came home that night after a long day of work. They hugged in happiness, and Callie even kissed Arizona's belly.\n\nThe now happy again couple went to look at a house with a pool and a swing set, where Arizona started dreaming of the life she and her family could have there. When Arizona took a step towards Callie, who wasn't paying attention to the house as she was busy working on her phone, she stumbled but managed to right herself, showing that her prosthetic leg is no longer a problem to her. \n\nOn the day of the first ultrasound, Callie was unable to come to the appointment because her surgery on [[Travis Reed]] ran long. Arizona came to the scrub room to inform her that she had missed the appointment, and Callie apologized. She asked Arizona to see the picture of the ultrasound, but Arizona told her that there was no picture. The OB did the ultrasound, but couldn't find a heartbeat. She lost the baby.\n\nLater on, Arizona tried to tell Callie how she felt about the miscarriage. Callie thought she was trying to pick a fight and said that they both lost the baby. She proposed they could wait a while before trying again, but Arizona replied that she didn't want to try again as she couldn't handle any more loss. Callie pushed Arizona to answer when she asked her if that meant she didn't ever want to try again, but all Arizona could say was that she didn't know. A disappointed Callie then left Arizona alone to go check on her patient.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\n\nSoon after her miscarriage, Arizona met a woman named Lauren Boswell at the coffee cart when she accidentally took Lauren's coffee. Arizona apologized, but Lauren made no big deal out of it and just took Arizona's coffee instead. Before walking away, she told Arizona she hoped she'd see her around, charming Arizona. Arizona tried to tell Callie who Lauren was (as her name was on the cup of coffee), but Callie was too occupied with trying to get through to Bailey, who had locked herself in her lab. Lauren and Arizona did meet again later when Lauren turned out to be the [[Craniofacial Surgery|craniofacial surgeon]] flown in to consult on a case of Arizona and Jackson. Lauren said she looked forward to talking strategy later on that day, charming Arizona again. While talking about the approach, Callie came in and Arizona introduced her to Lauren. Lauren continued explaining her approach, and said she'd make sure to show off a little in surgery for Arizona. Impressed by Lauren's skills, Callie whispered to Arizona that she was a little bit in love with Lauren, and Arizona awkwardly smiled. At the end of the day, Arizona met Lauren again in the elevator, which was what Lauren had hoped for. She complimented Arizona's eyes, and Arizona then said she was married to Callie and that she only had one leg. As she walked out of the elevator, Lauren said she already knew this as there is only Arizona Robbins on the Internet. Arizona smiled as the doors closed, charmed by the attention she was getting and her having only one leg being no problem for Lauren.<ref>[[Do You Believe in Magic]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Owen informed his staff that they had to cancel all elective procedures as preparation for the superstorm heading towards Seattle, Callie asked Arizona if she was going to postpone Tyler's surgery. Arizona snapped that a baby with his brain on his face wasn't elective and walked away. While presenting the procedure to Tyler's parents, Arizona told the parents she was not worried a bit, clearly complimenting Lauren's skills. Outside the room, Lauren and Arizona chatted for a while, and Arizona confessed that she googled Lauren too. They discovered they studied under the same surgeon, which made Lauren allow Arizona to do part of the surgery. Lauren then asked to get coffee before the surgery, but Arizona said she had other things to do. Lauren joked Arizona was probably going to cyber-stalk her some more, and Arizona replied she might. \n\nWhile scrubbing in early for the surgery, they discovered they were both control freaks. They started flirting somewhat, until Jackson entered the scrub room too. During the surgery, Lauren complimented both Arizona and Jackson for having bought the hospital and saved the staff. She looked right into Arizona's eyes and told her she was impressed. She asked Arizona to move closer to her to start her part of the surgery, while she offered to let Jackson do another part. At the end of the surgery, Lauren left to go the bathroom and Jackson then said that Lauren was just one of these people who could make you feel great. He wished she could stay around a little longer, and Arizona quietly agreed. Later that day, during the proposal when Matthew told April he felt a shock when he first saw her, Arizona and Lauren looked at each other. \n\nMoments later, the storm hit Seattle and Arizona and Lauren went to talk to Tyler's parents. Outside the room, Lauren asked Arizona to show her to an [[On-Call Room|on-call room]] as she likes to stay close by in case anything happens the first night post-op. Arizona did so, and they were both sorry Tyler's case was over. Lauren then said she would want her back at some point, and Arizona replied that would be great. Arizona stuck out her hand to say goodbye, but Lauren laughed at this. They moved closer and hugged, and as the lights fell out due to the storm, they kissed each other in the dark. When the lights came back on, Arizona pushed Lauren off and walked towards the door, saying she couldn't do this. Right before opening the door, Lauren told Arizona she was allowed to lose a little bit of control. Arizona then locked the door, kissed Lauren again, and took off Lauren's lab coat.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n[[File:xArizonalauren.jpg|thumb|xpx|Lauren and Arizona kiss.]]\nAs Callie started questioning where Arizona was, Arizona got dressed again in the on-call room to get to the understaffed [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]]. Lauren, who was still lying in the bed, asked if she needed an extra set of hands to help out, but Arizona rejected the offer. The situation in the NICU got even more complicated when the electricity died, meaning the ventilator batteries would die eventually. However, Lauren did not listen and came to the NICU anyway, stating she was not going to sit around while there was a room full of babies needing help. Alex happily accepted her help as Arizona had just told them they needed to do anything to keep the parents happy. While looking for spare batteries for the NICU machines, Arizona confessed to Alex that she cheated on Callie with \"that woman out there\" and that she felt horrible about it.\n\nAs Arizona was manually ventilating a baby, Lauren came over and told her that she wasn't going to leave things like this as she liked Arizona a lot. Then Callie appeared, just as the electricity came back on. In the light, Callie noticed Arizona's ring was pinned to Lauren's scrub top. Lauren tried to come up with an excuse, but Callie figured out what had happened. She and Arizona went to a lounge, where they started fighting. Callie questioned how Arizona could cheat on her after everything they've survived, like the plane crash. Arizona then yelled back that Callie hadn't been on the plane and out there in the woods for days, even though she kept on acting like she had been. Arizona then asked if Callie wanted the badge of honor and the warrior wounds for having survived the plane crash. \"Then great, stick out your leg and I will go grab a bone saw and let's even the score!\" Arizona yelled at Callie, who was heartbroken that Arizona still hadn't forgiven her about the leg. Arizona explained that Callie was the one person she trusted most in her life, and she was the one who decided to cut off the leg. Callie yelled back that she did so to save Arizona's life. Arizona yelled back that Callie didn't lose anything, while she did, alluding to her amputation and her miscarriage. A crying Callie replied that she apparently did lose Arizona.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Callie made the comment about having lost her, Arizona was left speechless as an angry Callie left the room. When Jackson came into the board meeting to tell them that Dr. Boswell was in a cab on her way to the airport, Callie outed Arizona as a cheater in front of everyone, embarrassing Arizona. Arizona and Callie were forced to work together on a victim of the mudslide caused by the storm, much to Callie's dislike. She specifically requested Bailey for the surgery on the patient, but since Bailey was busy with Richard, Arizona stepped up as a general surgeon. In the scrub room, Arizona asked Callie to set aside their problems for the patient. During the surgery, Leah complimented Arizona's technique, and Callie then apologized for having stated that Arizona wasn't a general surgeon. Arizona replied that it was okay, as they've all said things they shouldn't have. Later that day, Arizona met Alex in a supply room and they talked about her cheating. She thought it would make them stronger as a couple. She told him the ortho metaphor she worked out to tell Callie, but Alex wasn't enthusiastic about it and advised her to stick to apologizing for being such a slut. While they watched how Richard was brought to the OR, Arizona unsuccessfully tried to make eye contact with Callie.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nLater that evening, Arizona found Callie and asked her to have a conversation. She started saying that she deserved Callie telling everyone what she did, but Callie broke her off, saying now wasn't the time to talk. When Arizona came home after work, she found out that Callie took her clothes, Sofia, and some of Sofia's clothes. Not knowing that Callie was staying at Meredith's with Sofia, Arizona went back to the hospital and tried to get someone to page Callie , as Callie didn't reply to Arizona's pages. She got Alex to do so, but Callie was too drunk already to reply. Arizona was paged to Meredith's room, where Meredith told her that Callie and Sofia were at her house. Arizona went there, and she and Callie argued over their marriage and the decision to start a family while Derek watched Zola and Sofia. The next day at the hospital, Callie told Arizona, who started apologizing for the previous night, that they were going to take a break and live apart for a while, with switching off Sofia every two nights. They would do it like that for unknown time. However, that night, Arizona came to Meredith's house asking for a couple of minutes with Sofia. Cristina interfered and made Callie allow it. Arizona took her daughter to the deck, where she told Sofia that she loved and missed her.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nArizona decided to look nice to get Callie back. She got a haircut and chose Callie's favorite red dress. It was an incredibly busy day at work, as the hospital, which was in financial difficulties after the damage done by the storm, needed both doctors and board members. Also, several board members were out and Callie and Arizona couldn't be in the same room together, complicating things even more. Arizona reminded Callie that they had an appointment for couples' therapy, but Callie wasn't sure she was going to be there yet. In the evening, Owen did finally manage to gather all the board members to plan a fundraising gala to help out the hospital financially. At the end of the day, Callie did show up at the therapist's office, but only to tell Arizona that she was not going to therapy with her yet. She advised Arizona to follow therapy on her own for a while. Arizona begged her to talk about what happened as she really needed to talk, but Callie, who noticed Arizona wore the red dress, didn't want to talk about the cheating as it hurt her and walked off, leaving behind a devastated Arizona.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nArizona went to the fundraising gala, but soon left after having shared some awkward looks with Callie, who started to tell people that her wife died in the plane crash just to get more donations out of the rich people at the party. Arizona went to the hospital and started crying in a supply closet, only to be found by April, who was sent back to the hospital by Jackson to get cooling blankets for the champagne bottles. Arizona made up an excuse and told April she was fine, but started crying again as soon as April left the room. At the gala, April overheard Callie's fake story of being a widow and she decided to support Arizona. She took two bottles of champagne and returned to the hospital to drink with Arizona. Arizona then confessed she couldn't stand the way everyone stared at her, and the way everyone talked and judged her, including April. \"I know you're trying to hide it, but I can see it on your face,\" Arizona said. Arizona didn't deny she was a cheater, and explained that she cheated because Lauren stared at her too, but in a different way. She stared in a way that made Arizona feel really good. They got drunk, and paged Leah to the closet to get them some more champagne and snacks. Arizona asked April if she thought Callie was ever going to forgive her, and April honestly told her that Callie was telling everyone at the gala that Arizona was dead, so she guessed not. They got drunker and got more fun, both agreeing that they need to have fun again. At some point, April asked her if she could try on her leg and they both laughed. They called a cab to get them home, and Leah helped Arizona to get in. Leah asked Arizona to treat her with more respect. \"You're adorable,\" Arizona said, as she touched Leah's nose. Arizona then closed the door and the cab drove off.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nSome time after the gala, Leah brought Arizona a cup of coffee before the big surgery with Shepherd. Arizona asked April what she did to make Leah so nice to her, and then vaguely remembered that she may have brought Leah home with her the night of the gala. She was drunk then and now only had a vague memory of Leah in her kitchen, making her question if she slept with her. Arizona handed over the mortgage slips to Callie, who snapped at her. Arizona said that if Callie wanted her to move out, she only had to ask, but Callie replied she didn't want to live in the apartment she shared with her cheating wife. During the surgery, Leah came in, ready to scrub in. She told Arizona that Arizona promised to allow her to scrub in on the surgery on the night of the gala. Leah promised her she wouldn't tell anybody what happened, but Arizona cut her off and said she could be more useful handling patients on the floor, making Leah leave. That night, Arizona had a drink at Joe's bar, when Callie came in and told her that she was kicking Arizona out of the apartment right now, not even allowing her to pack up her stuff. Leah overheard this and offered her to stay at her place, and Arizona then asked her to tell what they did after the gala as she didn't remember and she was worried about what happened as Leah was a pretty girl. Leah told her she went to check if Arizona made it home, only to find her passed out on the hallway floor. They went inside, had a dance party, and ate grilled cheese sandwiches while watching videos of Shepherd performing a spinal AVM surgery, which is when Arizona promised her she could scrub in. Arizona confessed she only vaguely remembered the grilled cheese, and Leah then asked her to go back to the part where she said she was pretty, making Arizona smile in embarrassment.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nArizona and Leah started off a somewhat secret relationship and hung out together, but Leah thought it was more than Arizona did and she kept on texting Arizona. At the hospital, Leah told her she was ready to take it further. Arizona didn't think it was a good idea, though she still agreed to hang out that night. Leah planned to scrub in on a surgery with Arizona, which was observed by [[Emma Marling|Emma]], but Arizona said the OR was full and sent Leah away. In surgery, Arizona asked Alex about his strategy to get away from someone who gets way too attached after a one-night stand, which wasn't even a real one-night stand. \"You know who's like that? Leah Murphy,\" Alex said, adding that Leah goes from zero to \"I love you\" in  seconds. Leah eventually told her fellow residents that she was having something with Arizona. Arizona waved her over and Leah apologized to Arizona for having told them, but Arizona then said she was going to be very frank. She said the other night was a bad call because she was lonely, that it was just once and that it would stay that way, and she asked Leah to adjust her expectations if she was expecting more. An emotional Leah said it was her fault and apologized for having misunderstood as she tried to hold back her tears. This touched Arizona and she tried to talk, but Leah ran off into the restroom. That night, Arizona felt lonely again in her hotel room and decided to text Leah again.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nArizona started off a sexual relationship with Leah and they agreed it would just be sex. However, the night before Halloween, Leah did sleep over, which they had previously agreed she wouldn't do. Arizona didn't seem to mind and let go of their agreement when she offered to have breakfast together, but Leah left as she wanted to show Arizona she was serious about being easy peasy. At the hospital, Arizona and Callie found out they both made different costumes for Sofia. Arizona proposed to have Sofia choose between her astronaut costume and Callie's princess costume, but Callie thought it wasn't worth the fight and told Arizona she could take Sofia to the party at Meredith's. Before going to the party, Arizona opened up to Leah, who was scared she got HIV after a patient bit her,  about her first disease scare during her residency and she told Leah she didn't have to try to be easy peasy all the time. In the evening, Callie and Arizona eventually both went to Meredith's party and set aside their problems that night for Sofia. They combined their costumes, so Sofia dressed up as a space princess, which was the first thing they agreed on in months. Together with Meredith and Derek, they took Sofia out for trick-or-treating.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Emma Marling was offered a position as maternal-fetal surgeon, Arizona informed her that Callie, her ex-wife, was going to interview her. Emma asked for more information about Callie, and Arizona told her that Callie is great, but not that great as they're divorced now. During a conversation with April, Arizona revealed that she and Leah took the flirtation further and had amazing sex. After the interview, Emma asked Arizona how long she and Callie have been divorced, and while playing with her necklace, Arizona admitted that she didn't think they were, saying they were more more just separated than divorced. Emma noted that Arizona was still wearing the ring while seeing other people, which Arizona confirmed. Emma apologized for being too personal, but Arizona didn't mind as they do too personal on a daily basis at Grey Sloan Memorial. That night, before joining Leah in the shower in her hotel room, Arizona carefully took off her necklace and carefully put it away in a box.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Callie was informed that both she and the hospital were being sued by [[Travis Reed]], a board meeting was called. They discussed whether or not the hospital should settle, as they were risking bankruptcy all over again if the case was going to trial. The hospital decided to settle, while Callie decided to fight the allegations. When Arizona came to pick up Sofia before Callie had to go to the court for her lawsuit, she told Callie that she was willing to do whatever Callie needed to feel good in the difficult period of being sued. While Callie was putting on her pantyhose, Arizona noted that Callie had her wedding ring back on. Callie replied that she put it on because her lawyer told her to, and Arizona then wished her good luck before leaving with Sofia. During a break in court, Arizona met Callie in the bathroom of the courthouse, where Callie was changing her pantyhose. Callie was feeling awful, and Arizona gave her a drawing Sofia made to make her feel better. Callie took the drawing and thanked Arizona for being there. They then shared a laugh when they discovered Callie had accidentally put on pantyhose with butterflies on them.\n\nDays after, Arizona came to pick up Sofia at Callie's. She was stared at intensely by Callie's dad, as he found out she cheated on his daughter. Feeling uncomfortable, Arizona quickly left with Sofia. However, it was Carlos who later revealed during a conversation with Callie that he once cheated, but he and Callie's mother decided to give their marriage another chance, with Callie's mother having forgiven him for the one mistake he made. Callie then went to Arizona's hotel room, and told her that she got that Arizona made one mistake. She forgave her for that and asked her to come home. She gave Arizona time to think about it and left. Arizona then went back into her hotel room, where she asked a naked Leah to get dressed and leave right now.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after, Arizona moved back into Callie's apartment, though Callie made her sleep on the couch. At work. she and Leah worked together on a girl with a broken femur, which required Callie consulting. Arizona made it clear to Leah that she and Callie were trying to repair their marriage and assured her that it didn't have to be awkward between the three of them. However, Arizona confessed to Callie that she slept with someone more than ten times while they were broken up but assured her that it was over. Arizona begged her wife to keep trying to fix their marriage, and after agreeing, they hugged each other for the first time in months. Arizona didn't mention who she slept with, though Callie figured it out later in surgery when Leah made a mistake and desperately begged Arizona to step in and help her. Arizona did help her, but when Leah was ranting at her after the surgery for having told Callie that they slept together, Arizona made it clear that her marriage was more important than making sure Callie wouldn't hate Leah. At the end of the day, Arizona told an angry Callie that she couldn't keep apologizing and that Callie couldn't keep playing a victim. Arizona said that she was back, but not to be Callie's whipping boy and then demanded to sleep in the bed again. Callie asked for one more night to process Arizona having slept with Leah, and Arizona pointed out she wasn't exactly enthusiastic about Arizona being back.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nArizona and Callie continued to work on their marriage. They managed to stay professional with Leah, who tried her best to forget about Arizona. However, there was still some tension between Arizona and Callie. When Callie was sad because her research was failing, Arizona tried to get her to cheer up, but after some snapping, Callie just walked out on Arizona. While talking with [[Kimmie Kepner|Kimmie]] about their marriages where one of the partners cheated, Kimmie revealed that she and her husband just hope things will get better as they don't feel the need to talk it to death. At the end of the evening, Callie and Arizona started fighting again at their apartment. They then realize that them trying to talk with each other so much may be the problem, and they kiss each other passionately.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of April's wedding, Callie and Derek started the second phase of their research. When Callie joined Arizona in surgery, she told her wife that it was a good thing for her, as the goal of the research was to get Arizona a leg that's as sensitive and responsive as the leg she lost. During the surgery, Callie asked Arizona if she would wear her high heel leg to the wedding, but advised her not to as the wedding was at a muddy farm and Arizona's leg always gets sore after a while. Arizona said she'll be fine, and then Callie heard that the boy they were operating on was most likely accidentally paralyzed by his father, who didn't wait for an ambulance after the accident. Callie started criticizing the father, but Arizona came to his defense. \"Sometimes we try to make things better and we have actually no idea that we're actually causing more pain,\" Arizona said, clearly also talking about Callie trying to fix her.\n\nAt the wedding, Callie once again brought up that she was doing the research for Arizona. Arizona started crying a bit, and she quickly went to the farm with Callie. Arizona went to help April to get dressed up, and broke down in the dressing room. She revealed it was driving her crazy how Callie kept on trying to forgive and take care of her. She clarified she really wants to fix the relationship that she had broken, while Callie wants to fix her. Arizona added that that's what made Lauren so attractive, as she was still attracted to Arizona, even though she never knew her before the accident. Callie makes her feel like she's not enough, and she knows it's unfair to Callie, which is why she hates feeling like this. \"Callie is trying to fix everything and I'm finally feeling okay the way that I am now, and I'm not sure Callie will ever make me feel that way,\" Arizona concluded as April hugged her to comfort her. Arizona walked April down the aisle and shared a look with Callie, which made her cry once again.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nCallie and Arizona decided to use a surrogate to try to have another child. However, they got into a fight in the waiting room at the surrogacy agency and put the idea on hold. They decided to go see a [[Kim Dawson|marriage counselor]] who told them to take a  day break. During their first attempt, they kissed on day  and had to re-start. On the second go, day , Callie and Arizona slept together, but agreed not to tell their marriage counselor. As Arizona kept busy with her new fellowship, Callie confided in Meredith and they went to Joe's bar together. On day , they went back to the counselor together, where Arizona said that she needed Callie, her anchor. However, Callie responded that she had spent the last  days feeling free, doing more and feeling better. She decided she didn't want to be with someone who made her feel stuck and she believed that working on their marriage was slowly killing her. <ref>[[Bend & Break]], x</ref>\n\n\nArizona began a new fellowship at GSMH with [[Nicole Herman|Dr. Nicole Herman]], an outstanding fetal surgeon who began to teach Arizona all her skills and knowledge.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref> Arizona quickly learned that Dr. Herman had a brain tumor and had been given six months to live.<ref>[[Don't Let's Start]], x</ref> Dr. Herman stated that in that time, she would teach Arizona everything she knows for none of her knowledge is written down in books and she wanted her knowledge to be known so it could save more lives. Arizona agreed to continue to work with her without telling anyone else.<ref>[[Could We Start Again, Please?]], x</ref> However, she began to suspect that Dr. Herman's behavior change was due to the tumor and had her scans sent over for her to look at. She consulted with [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], who later told Arizona that she believed she could remove the tumor.<ref>[[Risk]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Alex moved out and sold the house back to Meredith, Arizona had to move out. She found a house and pinned a flyer to a board at the hospital to find a roommate. Much to her discomfort, nobody was interested, so she took a tab of her own flyer to make other people interested. Throughout the day, Arizona noticed that Stephanie acted as if there were a reason that people didn't want to live with her. When confronted about this, Stephanie confessed that Arizona intimidated residents and interns because of everything she had been through and done in both her professional and personal life. At the end of the day, intern Andrew DeLuca showed interest as nobody else wanted to live with him. Arizona decided they'd work it out and accepted him as her roommate.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nOn Bailey's first day as Chief, Arizona was confronted with Callie enthusiastically telling everyone but her about her fantastic new girlfriend. That sparked a little bit of jealousy in Arizona, but she told Callie she could still always talk to her. When Callie started talking about how great her girlfriend was and how they connected, Arizona asked her to dial down the enthusiasm a little and advised her to read the room before opening her mouth.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\nArizona had a moment of looking back on her life when she worked together with Alex on two equally sick twins and they had to decide which one would get the donor liver. The situation reminded Arizona about their first case together and she shared that she was very proud of him and that she trusted him to handle this case well.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter having heard about Penny through Callie's stories, it was finally time for Arizona to meet her at the dinner party at Meredith's house. Arizona really wanted to meet her, but she was nervous and it also reminded her that she had nobody. That day, she bonded with an old patient who found new love in a retirement home, and that man made her believe that she'd find love again. Up until that day, she thought she'd screwed up the one great love of her life. That evening, Arizona was nervous about meeting Penny at the dinner party and started drinking excessively to ease her nerves.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref> The drinking helped to ease her nerves and she and Penny were introduced by Callie. They bonded over a shared experience of moving all the time as a kid. Arizona really took a liking to Penny and described her as perfect, which led her to wonder why she didn't have a Penny herself. She joked about taking Penny home, until the dinner party was blown when Meredith revealed that Penny was the doctor who had failed to save Derek. Arizona then took to eating dessert right out of the dish before April took her home.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Arizona decided it was time to get back in the dating pool and picked trivia night at a lesbian bar as the perfect opportunity to dip her toe in. Both April and Alex turned her down to accompany her, but Richard was very interested in a trivia night. She didn't dare to tell him the truth until they were at the bar. She confided she was nervous to start dating again and didn't know where to start. Richard proved a very capable wingman and got her connected to several women to her liking.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref>\n\nArizona was interested in a female firefighter named Charlotte, who ended up at the hospital with a gluteal burn. Arizona inadvertently complimented her butt and they bonded over the fact that both their jobs meant that other people had to go through something bad. She approached Richard so he could find out if Charlotte was also interested in her, but he refused to wingman a patient. Arizona tried to ask her out, but Charlotte mistook it as an invite for a follow-up. She went to ask Richard for advice, and was told that she was a smart and confident woman. All she had to do was stretch her wings and feel the air. As she gathered up the courage to ask Charlotte out, she was surprised when Charlotte introduced her to her girlfriend. She quickly discharged Charlotte and went to tell Richard that she crashed instead of flew.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the failed attempt, she and Richard continued their nights out to the lesbian bar.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref> Arizona was the first one to find out about April's pregnancy after her divorce to Jackson.<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref> As she tried to steer April towards telling Jackson, Richard inquired Arizona about the woman she had left the bar with. She initially dismissed it as just fine, but he insisted to hear more so he could improve his wingman project. She then said they went \"everywhere.\" Despite the fact that it was fun, she decided not to see the woman again because she was also kind of crazy. As they were operating, Richard asked how many women she was seeing. Arizona replied not so many and asked Andrew to back her up, but then realized he was with his girlfriend every night. She recalled he brought her to their house once and shared she was a real screamer, unaware that she was talking about Maggie. Afterwards, as she was preparing to leave for another date, he told her he worried that a quality person like her was squandering her heart with all those different woman. She said her wingman couldn't also be her dad. He helped her to remember what it was like to be fun and confident and a little slutty, something she wanted to embrace while she was still young and fun. He helped her fly.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref>\n\nApril continued to refuse to tell Jackson about her pregnancy while Arizona continued to advise her to tell him, since other people had already find out. At the end of the day, Arizona witnessed Maggie finally coming clean about her relationship with Andrew.<ref>[[All Eyez on Me]], x</ref> Arizona continued to push April to tell Jackson since she worried April was doing this alone. April then declared Arizona her companion, after which Arizona stated they would do this right with monitoring and tests. However, April refused to have her baby tested, convinced he or she would turn out okay. Arizona tried to get support from Alex, but he initially didn't want to get mixed up in the matter. However, after working with Arizona on a woman with quadruplets, he had a talk with April. While April initially still refused to tell Jackson, she finally realized she needed to do it before he found out from someone else. As she went to see him in his lab, she was shocked to find out that Arizona had just delivered the news behind her back.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref> April was furious at her. Arizona explained she didn't want April to go through what happened last time again, but April says her faith in a good outcome would remain until God told her otherwise. She then asked Arizona to stay away from her and told her to go to Hell. Arizona continued to think she did the right thing, but both Callie and Bailey told her she did wrong. Later, Amelia told her that all she could do to make it right was to wait and hope that April would eventually forgive her.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref> As April continued to be mad, Arizona found herself in the middle of other people's situation again when Callie lied to Penny and told her that Arizona was not comfortable with her meeting Sofia. Upon finding out, Arizona set the record straight and went to tell Callie she was done with getting in the middle of other people's things.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\nThe feud with April was solved when they worked together on [[Jennifer Parker|Jenny Parker]], a pregnant teen who refused to tell her mother about the pregnancy. Having learned her lesson, Arizona respected Jenny's wishes while April eventually told the mother. While April did not consider her situation and Jenny's to be the same, Arizona pointed out she felt about April's situation as April felt about Jenny's. Later that night, April confessed that she had overheard Catherine saying Jackson wanted to sue for full custody over their child and that, refusing to be a victim, she filed for a restraining order against Jackson.<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref> Arizona accompanied April to [[Lucinda Gamble]], a lawyer, to get advice on her situation with Jackson and later gave her an ultrasound to assure her everything was fine with her baby.\n\n\nAt work, Arizona walked in on Callie and Penny getting intimate in a supply closet. Callie later came to apologize, she brought up that Penny was moving to New York after winning the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]]. As she wasn't sure their relationship would survive that, Arizona pointed out there were plenty of ways to make it work if she wanted it to work. That advice backfired heavily as it inspired Callie to decide to move to New York with Penny, and take Sofia with her. She assured Arizona she could see Sofia whenever she wanted and then got paged away, leaving a shocked Arizona. After witnessing Sofia leave with a happy Callie and Penny, Arizona took to Lucinda Gamble herself to start a custody battle over Sofia as she refused to let Callie move across the country with her daughter.<ref>[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]], x</ref>\n\nArizona met up with Callie, who was excited about moving to New York and shared school brochures of New York schools, for which they would need to apply if Sofia were to move to New York. Arizona asked her to take a step back and pointed out she never said yes to the plan. Callie wanted to discuss options, but Arizona said it sounded like she had already decided. She argued Sofia's life was in Seattle. Callie argued that Arizona moved a lot in her youth and she turned out fine. Arizona walked away and discussed the problem with Richard, who understood her urge to protect herself but also exemplified April and Jackson's turbulent situation, caused by overreactions and misunderstandings. He urged her to think about Sofia, who was too important to do something that could not be undone. However, Arizona solidified her stance when she was contacted by a New York school about Sofia's application. Later, Callie came to apologize for jumping the gun, but Arizona told her about the Barton School calling her. Callie explained there were waiting lists. Arizona then gave Callie her lawyer's card and stated they would only talk through her. Callie asked who was jumping the gun now, but Arizona bounced back that she was the one who started this.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], x</ref>\n\nPrior to the hearing, Richard advised Arizona to get some friends to testify for her, however she didn't want to do it and thought the subpoena should do that. Richard encouraged her and she figured out that she would have April and Jackson's support. However, before she managed to ask them for the favor while doing ultrasound for April, Penny came into the room and told Arizona that she was on Arizona's service that day. Later in the cafeteria, Arizona tried to ask Alex to testify for her, which he promptly rejected, as he considered both Callie and her as friends. Penny then appeared. Arizona yelled at her, believing she was spying for Callie, before leaving. Arizona was then found crying in her car by Richard. She told him that she was fighting a losing battle. Richard said if she wanted her daughter, she had to fight like she'd never fought before.<ref>[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]], x</ref>\n\nBefore the custody hearing started, Arizona and Callie's respective lawyers tried to negotiate to prevent going to court, but failed to come to a compromise. In court, after hearing both sides, Arizona was eventually granted sole physical custody of Sofia.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref> Arizona, seeing how sad Callie was, agreed to let Callie have her for alternating school years and Christmases.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nArizona traveled to New York to help Sofia get settled with Callie and Penny. When she returned to Seattle, she was confronted with Andrew's bruised up face. She confronted Alex, who had ignored her concerned calls and texts, and scolded him for his actions. She later assured Andrew she didn't want him to move out of the house and expressed support for him. While still mad at him, Arizona also missed Alex. He told Arizona that the guy she trained and raised was still there since he was determined to work at the clinic to get his job back rather than quitting.<ref>[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Eliza first came to Grey Sloan, she flirted with Arizona, telling her she didn't need to write her name down to remember it.<ref>[[Why Try to Change Me Now]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Eliza came to the hospital to help out after a building collapsed, she was surprised that Arizona appeared not to remember their conversation, but Arizona admitted that she did and she was interested, but she didn't like that Eliza talked like she owned the place. They agreed to go get a drink together afterward. <ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, when Eliza officially started, Arizona had joined the resistance against Eliza's policies. Despite this, Eliza found Arizona at the end of the day and told her that her allowing Leah to take the lead on the Wallace baby was a perfect example of her teaching strategy and thanked her for being on board.<ref>[[Jukebox Hero]], x</ref>\n\nAs Arizona was leaving the hospital the next day, Eliza found her and when she claimed she'd be happy if Eliza was fired, Eliza called her on it, saying it would scare her because it would mean the two of them could be something.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\nAfter losing her first child patient, Eliza was distraught and Arizona coached her on how to get through that loss. At the end of the day, when Arizona was leaving work, she saw Eliza crying in her car and hitting the steering wheel. This caused the horn to honk continuously. Arizona told her to pop the hood and she quickly pulled the horn wire, which she told Eliza she'd need to have fixed. Eliza thanked her and then they hugged. Arizona told Eliza that she could have friends at the hospital if she wanted.<ref>[[It Only Gets Much Worse]], x</ref>\n\nAround the hospital, the two continued to pretend not to get along. However, at the end of the night, Arizona said she didn't want to pretend, because Eliza's nice and funny and people should know that. Eliza told her to be quiet and kissed her.<ref>[[Back Where You Belong]], x</ref>\n\nEliza asked Arizona about how big her stove was, because she wanted to make Arizona pierogi. She then flirtatiously said, in Polish, that once Arizona had her pierogi, she'd never want anyone else's. However, that evening, when Eliza went to find Arizona, she was asleep on the couch. They agreed to rest for a minute and then rally, but they both fell asleep and when they woke up, it was morning. They leaned in for a kiss, but Richard Webber interrupted, discovering their relationship.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n\nAfter they'd been seeing each other for a while, Eliza told Arizona she was ready for them to have sex. They made plans for that night, but they were cancelled when one of Arizona's patients went into labor, but Arizona told Eliza that she looked for her around the hospital all the time and that the anticipation of waiting one more day wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. The next night, they left the hospital and went to Arizona's house, where they had sex.<ref>[[Leave It Inside]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the hospital fire chaos had settled, Arizona found Eliza and suggested they go back to her place to have overly tired sex before getting some sleep. Eliza told her she couldn't. She needed to pack up her things because she'd been fired.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\nEliza \"ghosted\" Arizona, not replying to her messages and moving out of her apartment without saying a word to Arizona about it.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Sofia moved back to Seattle, she told Arizona that she wanted her room to be green, but Arizona couldn't decide which shade, so she told Sofia she could decide herself and they'd paint it together. She also surprised Sofia with three different flavors of ice cream.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nAfter her return to Seattle, Sofia refused to go to school. She said she wanted to go back to New York with her friends and the teacher who let them draw on their notebooks. Instead of making her go to school, Arizona took Sofia to work with her, where Sofia met [[Noah Brosniak]], the son of a patient, and the two played together while Arizona examined Noah's mom. Noah was diagnosed with a brain tumor and when Arizona tucked Sofia in that night, she cried because she realized she was so lucky to have a healthy, smart girl and she was sometimes too busy to understand that. She suggested that she take the next day off and take Sofia to find an adventure.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nAfter that incident, Sofia continued to refuse to go to school. Arizona had to bribe her in order to get her to go to school.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nSofia was suspended from school for stealing the field trip money from her class. Arizona took her to work and put her in the daycare for the day. Then she learned from reading Sofia's diary that she stole the money to buy a plane ticket to New York and didn't want to tell Arizona because she worried about hurting her feelings. That led her to make the decision that Sofia needed to move back to New York and she needed to go with her.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\n\nAt the time of her first appearance, Arizona was a cheerful and bubbly person, waking up happy every day. She genuinely cares for her patients and their relatives. Her bright personality became darker after the plane crash, but over time, she found herself and her happiness again, albeit more serious than she used to be.\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nArizona is a lesbian and was married to [[Callie Torres]].[[File:Callie&Arizona.jpg|thumb|Callie and Arizona]]\n\nAt the [[Emerald City Bar]], she saw that Callie was upset and came to comfort her in the bathroom and kissed her. Callie soon decided to ask her out, but Arizona declined the offer after finding out [[Erica Hahn|Erica]] was Callie's first girlfriend. Her reasons were metaphorical: she deals mostly with newborns at work; she does not want to deal with them in her personal life, but she claimed \"[she is] super flattered. Super.\" at the offer. Annoyed, Callie confronted her, but the situation was made more awkward after she discovered that Arizona was on a date with a woman named [[Julie]].\n\nCallie started to avoid her, but she was eventually cornered in the elevator. Arizona then decided to explain that sometimes she doesn't always make the right choice under pressure and that she was wrong. Callie accepted it and Arizona asked her out again and after pretending not to be interested for a few seconds, Callie accepted.\n\nTheir relationship continued, but when Callie's father came to visit and discovered that she was dating a girl, he cut Callie off. Mark and Cristina both suggested that she lie and say she broke up with Arizona, but after Arizona approached her and told her that she loved how Callie cared so much about things and wouldn't care if Callie lied, Callie decided not to lie because her family should accept her.\n\nHowever, Callie began to withdraw slightly and began to avoid Arizona. Arizona then asked if their relationship was just a fling and it had run its course and Callie told her that it probably was. Arizona later approached Callie and Callie told her the real reason was because she didn't have the money for four-star restaurants anymore but Arizona told her that they could stay in and eat sandwiches. Callie countered that neither of them liked sandwiches, so they settled on pizza instead.\n\nThe relationship was threatened again when Callie got annoyed at Arizona for believing that George joining the army was awesome, but after hearing that Arizona's brother died in the war, she apologized.\n\nOn Arizona's birthday, after a failed surprise party, Arizona told Callie she loved her, and Callie reciprocated her feelings. Callie was dismayed to learn that Arizona didn't want children. She assumed that Arizona's reluctance was related to her brother's death, but Arizona told her she simply liked her life the way it was. They came to the conclusion that they could not continue their relationship, as they both wanted different things. However, after a shooter entered Seattle Grace with a vendetta for Derek, Lexie, and Richard, they were in lockdown together, and eventually decided to get back together and have kids. They passionately kissed in happiness.\n\nSix months after the shooting, Arizona received word that she had been given the Carter Maddison Grant, and was allowed to go to Malawi and become a doctor there. She had applied for this grant two years previously, when she hadn't met Callie yet. After some hesitation, Arizona decided to accept the grant. In the end, Callie was shown to have accepted this as well and decided to leave with Arizona. However, a fight at the airport resulted in Arizona leaving for Africa without Callie. After some time passed, Arizona came back and told Callie she missed her, but Callie closed the door in her face.\n\nCallie continued to reject Arizona's constant pleading and apologies. Eventually, Callie revealed that she was pregnant with Mark's baby. After asking for time to process, Arizona accepted the situation, and she and Callie restarted their relationship. Callie and Arizona later reconciled and they moved back in together. After seeing the baby's heartbeat for the first time, Arizona referred to the baby as \"theirs.\"\n\nHowever, tensions continued with Mark in the picture as an active and interested father. Callie gifted Arizona with a weekend getaway, but continued communicating with Mark as she and Arizona drove. Arizona's jealousy came to the forefront, and the two argued, with Callie concluding, \"Tell me what you want and I'll do it.\" After a pause, Arizona said, \"Marry me.\" They had shocked faces as they approached a stopped truck and crashed. Arizona was slightly battered, but Callie (who'd taken off her seatbelt) flew through the windshield. A series of surgeries followed (including the delivery of [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|her very premature baby]]) along with emotional breakdowns by both Mark and Arizona. Callie eventually woke up and turned to Arizona, who was sitting at her bedside, and whispered, \"Yes, I'll marry you.\" They finally married at a ceremony officiated by [[Miranda Bailey]].\n\nThe plane crash put a strain on their relationship. Arizona made Callie promise that she would not cut her leg off and Callie agreed. However, Arizona had an infection in her leg that she could have died from if she didn't cut off the leg. Because Callie broke the promise, Arizona began to ignore her. Finally, as she regained her strength and confidence when she learned to use her prosthetic. Arizona even became pregnant with a sperm donor's child but miscarried. Their relationship took a turn for the better until Arizona slept with Lauren Boswell during the superstorm, and Callie found out. Callie and Arizona were separated until after Callie's trial when Callie asked Arizona to move back in. After Arizona cheats on [[Callie Torres]] with [[Lauren Boswell]] during the superstorm. When Callie finds out she is furious she ends up kicking her out of the house. After being kicked out Callie and Arizona both agree couples therapy would be the best option. In the end, Arizona and Callie end up divorcing.\n\n[[Lauren Boswell]]\nDr. Lauren Boswell came to GSM to perform a surgery on an infant with his brain growing on the outside of his head. She was very flirtatious with Arizona, who happily flirted back. They would joke about how they looked at each other up on the internet and knew all about each other. At the start of the [[Readiness is All|superstorm]], she asked for Arizona to show her to an on-call room to rest in. Arizona obliged and took her there. They said their goodbyes and Arizona extended her arm for a handshake. Lauren simply laughed and they hugged. The lights flickered off from the superstorm as they started kissing. As the lights flickered back on, Arizona pushed her off, saying that she couldn't do that. Arizona almost left and Lauren said, \"Arizona, you are allowed to lose a little bit of control.\" Arizona pondered the thought for a moment and ended up locking the door instead of opening it. She returned to Lauren and kissed her while she pulled off Lauren's lab coat. The two of them had sex and accidentally exchanged scrub tops, which is how Callie noticed later that Arizona had cheated on her.\n\n[[Leah Murphy]]\nOn the night of the fundraising gala, Arizona Robbins and [[April Kepner]] bonded over drinks in the hospital storage closet. Since they were too intoxicated to drive, Leah called them a cab.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref> Shortly thereafter, Leah called to make sure the girls arrived home safely and ended up visiting Arizona at her apartment. The two watched movies and talked all night (though Arizona remembered none of it). Worried about what took place that night, Arizona asked Leah if anything happened between them and Leah told her nothing had.\n\nHowever, the two ended up making out on a different occasion, causing Leah to become somewhat obsessed with Arizona (much like she did with Alex). Arizona rebuffed her obsession and ended things. Leah told Arizona that she respected her so much and the thought of Arizona thinking about her in that way made her feel amazing. That night Arizona texted Leah asking 'What are you up to?' implying that she wanted her to come over. The two of them ended up sharing a kiss.\n\nOn the morning of Halloween, Leah wakes up in Arizona's hotel bed. She gets ready to leave, waking up Arizona, Arizona says that she doesn't have to leave. Leah says she knows she's not supposed to sleep over and apologizes, but Arizona says it's okay. Leah thinks it's not, as she's all about easy. At the hospital, Leah gets bit in the neck by a drug addict and is tested for HIV. Arizona helped calm her worry. She told Leah a similar story to reach out to her.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref> The two of them continued to see each other sexually until Callie asked Arizona to move back in. \n\n[[Eliza Minnick]]\nWhen a new consultant was hired by Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to revamp their surgical residency program, Eliza made a loud entrance. When Eliza was in the elevator on her way to Bailey's office, Arizona walked by and asked if she needed help. Eliza answered that she forgot where chief Bailey had her office. Arizona then mentioned that Eliza had made a big mistake leaving Arizona's name off the list of good teachers. Eliza insisted that the list was only made to help her remember everyone's names. Arizona wondered why Eliza would not have to learn her name. Eliza then answered, \"That name attached to that face? That's not one you forget.\"\n\nOn Eliza's first day at Grey Sloan, Eliza helped out where she was needed. She then ended up helping Arizona, during which she flirted. Arizona played it cool and acted like she didn't remember their conversation by the elevator. They later agreed to get drinks. However, after Arizona travelled to a prison hospital with Bailey and Jo, and then returned to work on Eliza's official first day, she blew Eliza off, stating that she was too tired. Eliza told her that she only wanted to compliment her on implementing her new teaching method, by allowing Leah to intubate the baby unsupervised.\n\nArizona was later annoyed when Eliza moved one of her surgeries, and accused Eliza of turning everybody against her, but Eliza defended herself by saying that people were simply afraid of change. Arizona blamed Eliza for having Meredith suspended, which surprised Eliza, who was unaware of Meredith's suspension. Later, Arizona was confronted by Eliza in the parking lot, with Eliza claiming while Arizona was acting as though she was against her, she was really afraid of Eliza being fired, as that would mean the pair could pursue a relationship.\n\nWhen Eliza forgot to alert the authorities that Stephanie went missing during the hospital lockdown and explosion, Bailey fired her. When Arizona found her and asked if they could have sex, Eliza said she needed to pack her things since she was fired, leaving Arizona speechless. Arizona then tried to give her some space, but later found out Eliza had left town without saying goodbye, effectively ghosting Arizona.\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nShe met Carina at a bar. She ended up bringing her home and the two had sex.\n\nEven after Andrew came home and interrupted the events, they continued. The next day, when Arizona found out that Carina was at the hospital doing research, she went to see her and Carina continued her flirting.\n\nArizona described the sex the two of them had as pain-relieving.\n\nAfter learning that Sofia was coming back home, Arizona inadvertently broke things off with Carina.\n\nAfter not seeing Arizona for a few days, Carina asked her if she was okay. Arizona said she'd taken a few days off after Karin Taylor's death. Arizona was shocked to learn Carina had never lost a mom, while Carina was shocked to learn Arizona had lost more than one. That inspired Arizona to look into it as a surgical project and once she had written up a proposal, she asked Carina to work on it with her, a decision they sealed with a kiss.\n\nAfter Carina made a comment about moving countries at the drop of a hat, Arizona asked her if she was just going to leave suddenly and end their relationship. Carina said that she had no plans to leave or end their relationship. \n\nWhen Arizona decided she needed to move herself and Sofia back to New York, she ended things with Carina.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nWhen Arizona first worked with Bailey after her arrival at Seattle Grace Hospital, they butted heads when they disagreed over the treatment plan Arizona's predecessor had set for [[Jackson Prescott]], which Bailey had supported. Bailey complained to Richard about Arizona, but he simply told her to work with Arizona because that's who they had. Despite this, Arizona quickly saw Bailey's potential as a pediatric surgeon, claiming she was \"uniquely qualified,\" and supporting her in her decision to apply for a spot in pediatric surgery.\n\nWhen Arizona gave her notice to Chief Bailey in anticipation of moving to New York, Bailey said when she had first met Arizona, she had thought Arizona was a pixie stick, an empty vessel, full of sugar, who skated in a hospital and didn't know then that it would be one of the great privileges of her life to know her and to work with her.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nOn her first day at the hospital, the only person Teddy knew was Owen. They joined Arizona, Mark, and Callie in the cafeteria. After lunch, Teddy and Arizona walked to the ER together. Jackson and Cristina were waiting for Arizona, because their patient was a boy with asthma. Teddy did a little exam and found that the boy had cardiac asthma. She asked for an OR, but Cristina, who had been questioning Teddy's abilities all day, was reluctant. Teddy then made it clear to Cristina that she had to what she said, and left. Arizona smilingly commented that she really liked Teddy. Later, when Arizona noticed Teddy staring mooningly at Owen, Arizona declared that the two of them were going to be friends, going so far as to claim that, \"I'm an awesome friend.\" She suggested that they do a ladies' night.\n\nWhen [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] asked Teddy out, Teddy confided in Arizona, who suggested that Mark was like candy: eat it and forget about it. When things sparked between Mark and Teddy, Arizona was again the one she confided in. When Arizona went to Africa, she and Teddy continued to keep in touch and regularly wrote to each other. When [[Callie Torres|Callie]] became pregnant and asked Arizona to be in, Arizona went to Teddy for advice on whether or not to be in. Arizona arranged ladies night for her after Henry died. Arizona and Teddy continued to keep in touch after Teddy moved to Germany, as Arizona learned about Owen double-dipping from her phone conversation with Teddy. \n\n[[April Kepner]]\nAfter seeing Callie at the [[Puttin' on the Ritz|fundraising gala]], Arizona escaped back to the hospital, where she hid in a supply closet to cry. April found her there and offered comfort, but Arizona kindly sent her away. However, at the party, April overheard Callie tell everyone that Arizona died in the plane crash they were in. Furious at this, she took two bottles of champagne and met Arizona in the hospital storage closet where she was hiding to share a drink and talk. They soon became very open with each other and discussed their relationship problems together, bonding them. April later stood up for Arizona against Callie when Callie mentioned wanting to move back into [[Callie and Arizona's Apartment|their apartment]]. She reminded Callie that Arizona needs the elevator and that it's already retrofitted to be accessible for her.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nRichard and Arizona's relationship started out as a complicated professional one, mainly due to Arizona's authority issues, which would result in her crying whenever the Chief opposed or intimidated her. However, she outgrew those authority issues and they eventually became good friends. Richard accompanied Arizona to a lesbian bar as her wingman and became her go-to person for dating troubles. He was also the one who supported her most during the custody battle and convinced her not to give up.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nAfter becoming Callie's girlfriend, Arizona also became good enough friends with Mark, Lexie, and Cristina. When she returned from Malawi, she asked Callie for a second chance. Callie then revealed that she was pregnant and that Mark was the father. Although initially she was not happy about this development, she decided she was in. However, she developed some resentment towards Mark, which would come to a head after her and Callie\us car crash. Eventually, both Arizona and Mark made up and together with Callie, the three raised Sofia together until Mark's death. When Callie was pregnant Mark and Arizona took an interest in her health and started cooking and trying new recipes together.<ref>[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex Karev and Arizona Robbins started out with a rocky relationship when they first met. But as time went on, Karev realized that Arizona was one of the few people who actually believed in him. Arizona Robbins saw Karev as a promising peds surgeon who was dedicated despite his temper and personal issues and continued to maintain a good mentor-student relationship with him until the end of Alex's residency. Karev's decision to leave [[Seattle]] to take the fellowship offer at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Hopkins]] led her to take his place on a plane that ended up crashing. While she was in the hospital trying to fight the infection in her leg, she mentioned that she was still very much \"pissed off\" and stated that she felt as though Karev should have been in the crash rather than herself, because she spent the whole time thinking about her wife and her baby and he had no wife and no baby; he had no one.\n\nWhen she returned to work, she and Alex maintained their friendship and working relationship with Alex looking out for her. She was unaware that Alex was the surgeon who cut off her leg until years later. Callie didn't tell her because she knew Arizona would hate her and she wanted her to have someone to lean on. When she did find out, she thanked Alex for telling her.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x</ref> While working together with Alex on two equally sick twins and they had to decide which one would get the donor liver they both needed, Arizona had a moment of looking back on her relationship with Alex. The situation reminded Arizona about their first case together and she shared that she was very proud of him and that she trusted him to handle this case well.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nicole Herman]]\nBefore Arizona undertook Nicole's fetal surgery fellowship, they seemed to have a close professional relationship, with Nicole often teasing Arizona about how fetal surgery was more difficult than pediatric surgery. As they began to work together more frequently, they got closer and became less hostile towards each other. They both often jointly spent several nights at the hospital, even going to great lengths as to steal the attendings' lounge sofa together, to continue working on Arizona's crash course. Arizona reached out to Nicole once when Nicole attended \"Blind School,\" but Nicole didn't pick up or call back, leaving Arizona to give up trying to initiate contact. They made up when Nicole returned to Grey Sloan and offered her money to open a center for women's health together.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nOthers\nArizona initially got off on the wrong foot with Dr. Bailey and Karev. Alex couldn't understand how she could be so perky after harvesting organs from a young child. When Dr. Kenley died Dr. Bailey took offense to Arizona changing [[Jackson Prescott|Jackson Prescott's]] course of treatment and proceeded to complain to the Chief and call her an \"infant\". However, Bailey soon realized that Arizona is a competent doctor and grew closer to her after applying for a peds fellowship.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Dr. Robbins at work.]]\n\nFollowing the death of [[Jordan Kenley|Dr. Jordan Kenley]], Dr. Robbins was appointed as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Pediatric Surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She was top of her class and she was the [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]] in her fifth year at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. She then completed her pediatric surgical [[Fellow|fellowship]] at Seattle Grace Hospital.\n\nWhen Bailey and Robbins first worked together, Richard said to Bailey that \"She's the best that anyone's seen in a long time, just like you are\". She is also on a first name basis with the Head of Pediatric Surgery at Johns Hopkins, as she studied under him during her residency.\n\nWhen Arizona won a grant to advance pediatric surgery in less developed countries, she gave her notice and resigned. Later, she returns to Seattle Grace as an attending under [[Robert Stark|Dr. Robert Stark]], the interim Head of Pediatric Surgery. A year later, Arizona resumes her position as the head pediatric surgeon.\n\nShe is very much aware of the nature of her job, Robbins has seen things in pediatric surgery to the extent she has nightmares about the tiny coffins that her patients will be buried in, and so she will remain optimistic in the face of the tragedy involved in her job.\n\nHer optimism and child-friendly abilities can be seen frequently and are also shown as she has cute animals on her lab coat; what appears to be a monkey or a lion above the Seattle Grace logo on the right hand side of her lab coat and a cat above her name and title on the left hand side; and she even wears Heelys at work, heeling around the hospital. When Cristina Yang was put on her service she made Cristina attach a small toy bear, Mr. Bear, to her lab coat and made sure she knew that pediatric surgery was not general surgery in miniature and that Cristina had to like children.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|- residency year]], Arizona decided to start a [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] under [[Nicole Herman|Dr. Nicole Herman]]. Because of brain tumor, Nicole is very harsh on Arizona, as she wants to teach Arizona years worth of fetal surgery knowledge within the six months she has left. She managed to teach Arizona everything from the one-year fellowship in less than half the time, thus making Arizona officially an attending fetal surgeon. When Herman was blind after her tumor resection, Arizona took over being head of fetal surgery.\n\n\n*Arizona wears a Holly Hobbie scrub cap.\n*Arizona likes pizza.\n*She drives a red Volvo S\n*Arizona dislikes sandwiches.\n*Arizona thinks that Sudoku is boring.<ref>[[She's Gone]], x</ref>\n*Prior to her left leg being amputated above the knee, she often wore wheeled sneakers at work.\n*When confronting someone who commands respect and authority, such as [[Daniel Robbins|her father]] or [[Richard Webber|Chief Webber]], she often used to break down and cry, but she seems to have gotten over it throughout the years.\n*When under pressure and in trouble, Arizona smokes cigarettes.<ref>[[Goodbye]], x</ref>\n*Arizona regularly treats patients under the table because she finds it hard to say no to parents of sick babies.\n*When her [[Timothy Robbins|brother]] died, she grieved by eating donuts and crying.\n*When Callie had the chicken pox, Arizona snooped through [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]]'s personnel file to see if she had been vaccinated against the chicken pox, which she had, so she put Lexie in charge of Callie's case.\n*She dislikes pumpkin scones.\n*She went to Malawi after winning a grant. However, this was a dangerous place for her to be as Malawi had strict anti-homosexuality laws at that time. Had she been discovered to be a lesbian, she could have faced up to  years of hard labor if convicted.\n*Arizona's left leg was amputated above the knee following her being in a plane crash.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n*[[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] calls her Mommy.\n*Arizona refers to her patients as tiny humans and to their parents as tiny human makers. \n*She and former patient [[Wallace Anderson]] share the same birthday.<ref>[[Invest in Love]], x</ref>\n*She hates camping.\n*She is the first known attending to have been the Head of two different departments, in this case Pediatric Surgery and Fetal Surgery.\n*During Arizona's third year as a med student, doing an [[Internal Medicine|internal medicine]] [[Clerkship|rotation]], she experienced an HIV-scare due to an incorrect needle retraction while working on an end-stage AIDS patient.\n*When she and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] decided to get pregnant, Arizona started making a list of terrible baby names, which included Raynbow, Bubba, Tulio, Agamemnon, Zamboni, Hashtag, and Digger. Since Callie didn't want any of the cute baby names she wanted, her plan was to bury them in a sea of terrible ones.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x </ref>\n*She used to be a fan of punk rock.

I was named for a battleship, the U.S.S. Arizona. My grandfather was serving on the Arizona when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and he saved  men before he drowned. Pretty much everything my father did his whole life was about honoring that sacrifice. I was raised to be a good man in a storm. Raised to love my country, love my family, protect the things I love. When my father, Colonel Daniel Robbins of the United States Marine Corps heard that I was a lesbian, he said he had only one question. I was prepared for, \"How fast can you get the hell out of my house?\" But instead, it was, \"Are you still who I raised you to be?\" My father believed in country the way that you believe in God.

''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\n\nAfter surgery, Braden was put into an isolation room because the enzyme injections had stopped working, leaving him vulnerable to infection. He woke up and was scared when he saw where he was. His parents assured him through the plastic barrier that they weren't leaving him and they love him. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-op, Braden's infection had cleared up. However, his T-cell count was still zero, so he had to remain in isolation. He used a remote control car to break through the plastic and escape to play tag with [[Francesca McNeil|Frankie McNeil]], but he was quickly found and taken back into isolation. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]] had the idea to use deactivated HIV to deliver the enzyme to Braden's body. His parents were initially concerned about the use of HIV, but Dr. Bailey assured them that she was not going to give Braden HIV. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nAfter receiving chemotherapy to kill off the enzyme-deficient bone marrow, Braden contracted a viral infection, concerning his parents. Worried that the treatment would make Braden even sicker, Teresa withdrew consent for the gene therapy. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morrises, Bailey proceeded with the gene therapy as planned. It went well and Braden's T-cell count was up to . He beat the infection and was able to start eating solid food again. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the treatment, Braden improved enough that Bailey felt comfortable discharging him. However, before she could do that, she had to inform his parents that she had gone ahead with the treatment. When she told them, they began to doubt the results. They also decided the press charges against Bailey for assault and battery. Owen and Jackson were able to assure them that the results were as she said they were, but not to drop the charges.\n\nStephanie Edwards lied and told them that she had forgotten to tell Bailey that they had withdrawn consent and it was entirely her fault. That still didn't convince them until they held their son and they agreed to drop the charges in exchange for Dr. Edwards being suspended for a week. ''(\"[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]]\")''\n\n\nAfter being discharged, Braden had a follow-up with his pediatrician and he was very healthy. ''(\"[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\")''\n\n\n\nBraden is annoyed by his parents, who are constantly worried about him because of his condition. He brushes off their attention and dislikes their nicknames for him.\n\n\n[[Francesca McNeil]]\nDuring his time in isolation, Braden befriended Frankie McNeil, who would visit his room and share gossip with him.

However, Marina had already been taken into the OR for a bowel resection. By the time he called, the OR staff had already collapsed from the effects of the neurotoxin.\n\nIn order to finish her surgery, they borrowed ortho suits. However, before they could finish getting ready, Marina started to wake up, so Addison had to go in to put her back under. Burke and Derek, then suited up, went in. They were able to complete the bowel resection, but didn't have time to close before they ran out of air. So the interns took turns going into the OR to pack her abdomen and do a temporary closure so she was stable for transport. She was then taken to ICU and given special dialysis to remove the toxin from her blood.\n\n\n\nShe is dating [[Vincent]].

When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie.

They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin.

The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up.

And then suddenly, here is this man and he becomes so familiar to you that one day you find yourself looking at him thinking I could love this person for the rest of my life.|'''Addison Montgomery'''}}\n\n'''Addison Forbes Montgomery''' (formerly '''Montgomery-Shepherd''') is a double\uaboard-certified [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]], subspecializing in [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]]/[[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]], a\ua[[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgeon]]\ua(one of the foremost in the country) and a\ua[[Medical Genetics|medical geneticist]]\uaat the\ua[[Seaside Health and Wellness]]. She is married to\ua[[Jake Reilly]]\uaand mother to [[Henry Montgomery]].\n\n\n\nAddison was born in [[Connecticut]] in  into a wealthy background with her brother [[Archer Montgomery|Archer]], father [[\"The Captain\" Montgomery|\"The Captain\"]]\uaand mother [[Bizzy Forbes|Bizzy]].\n\nWhen she was seven, she fell off her bike in the vineyard while going downhill because her tire came off. She flipped over the handlebars and scraped her face on the ground, but [[Archer Montgomery|Archer]] picked her up, told her it was going to be okay, and carried her the half a mile back home. This is how Addison has always seen her older brother, as the big brother who carried her home. \n\nFrom the age of eight, Addison was mixing her father, [[\"The Captain\" Montgomery|The Captain's]] drinks.\n\nWhen she was , Addison also had to deny her father's affair with his secretary, waiting for \"daddy\" while he was having sex in his office and then pretending she had fun getting ice-cream with her father. Her father also had affairs with (among others)  maids,  of Addison's nannies, Jolene her French tutor, and the chef. She only discovered in adulthood that it was her mother who had cheated first, with a woman but chose to stay married because she already had a family. The Captain knew but also stayed with her, but had affairs with other women.\n\nWhen she went to prom in high school, it was with Skippy Gold. Addison was a band geek with braces and a lisp, and she was forced to talk about ''[[Star Wars]]'' the whole night.\n\nAddison attended college at Yale University and medical school at [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] where she met her future husband,\ua[[Derek Shepherd]]; [[Sam Bennett]], a future boyfriend; [[Mark Sloan]], her future lover; and [[Naomi Bennett]], her best friend.\n\nAddison is entitled to a twenty-five million dollar trust fund and owns three properties: a\ua[[New York]]\uabrownstone, a house in\ua[[The Hamptons]], and a house at\ua[[Santa Monica]]. She now lives beside a beach in\ua[[Malibu]]\uanext door to an old friend,\ua[[Sam Bennett]].\n\n\nAddison cheated on her husband of over  years,\ua[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]\uawith his best friend\ua[[Mark Sloan]]. Before this, Addison and Derek's marriage had been an unhappy one, as Derek had been putting in little effort. Derek even mentioned that the demise of their marriage was not her fault alone. They each owned their respective practices, putting a strain on their marriage. When he found Mark and Addison in bed together, he simply walked away.\n\nDerek then picked up his life in New York, sold his private practice, and relocated to Seattle. This is where he began his relationship with\ua[[Meredith Grey]], who later became his wife.\n\n[[File:xAddisonIntroduction.png|thumb|Addison introduces herself to Meredith.]]\nUpon Richard's request to help out with a patient, Addison visited Seattle. When she arrived at the hospital, she saw Derek fixing Meredith's coat in the lobby. Derek turned around and was shocked to see her, his expression enough for Addison to put the pieces together. She walked over and he asked her what she was doing here. She said he'd know if he had bothered to return any of her calls. She then introduced herself to Meredith as Derek's wife, much to Meredith's surprise. She guessed that Meredith was the woman who had been screwing her husband.<ref>[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith ran off, leaving the married couple to talk. She mentioned that his hair looked different, comparing it to Russell Crowe's. He asked her again what she was doing there. She returned the question, pointing out he had abandoned his entire life in New York City. She also brought up his new Seattle girlfriend, who was young, sweet, and in awe of his being a neurosurgeon, whom she summarized as the 'anti-Addison.' He told her to forget about winning him back. She made it clear that was not her intention and stated she was there for a TTTS case on Richard's request. She assumed Richard would have told him. She leaned in and told Derek that she'd always had a thing for Russell Crowe before walking off with a satisfied expression. She went to see Richard, with whom she had a joyful reunion, until Derek interrupted to vent his frustration. Addison left him to it.\n[[File:-.jpg|thumb|Addison and Derek discuss her requesting Meredith for her case.]]\nThe next morning, Addison specifically requested Meredith for the TTTS case. Together, they went to see the patient. In the room, Addison bombarded Meredith with questions. Once outside, Meredith said she could have answered the question had Addison given her the time to do so. Addison commented she was tough on everyone, not just the women sleeping with her husband. She gave Meredith further instructions. Later, Meredith interrupted Addison and Derek talking about her surgical skills to brief Addison about abnormalities found on the ultrasound. Due to signs of heart failure in the babies, they had to operate sooner than planned. Meredith watched closely as Addison worked her magic in the OR. As they checked on Julie after the surgery, Julie requested Meredith be thrown off her case since she had overheard Addison's comment about Meredith sleeping with her husband. Addison then clarified that she had cheated on Derek so the wronged woman here was Meredith, whom she said deserved an apology from Julie.<ref>[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]], x</ref>\n\nAddison went to visit Richard in his room and found him in the company of Derek and Adele. Adele was delighted to see her and commented that she knew Addison and Derek would get back together, but Derek firmly said that adultery was enough to end their marriage. Later, Addison asked to talk to Meredith and inquired if Derek had told her why he had left her. Meredith said she had nothing to do with that situation. Addison was surprised and impressed to find out that Meredith had not taken Derek back. She added that there are two sides to every story and implied that her cheating on Derek with his best friend had been a desperate attempt to get his attention. At the end of the day, Addison ended up on an elevator with Derek. They shared what they had each told Meredith about their situation. Derek scoffed at the idea of Addison sleeping with Mark to get his attention. Addison replied that she was just scratching an itch by that point and Mark was just there, but it was preceded by years of them getting busy with their careers and lazy in their marriage. Derek made it clear he was not interested in Addison's explanation.<ref>[[Enough is Enough]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Addison moved into Derek's trailer, and the two attempted to reconcile. Addison asked Derek if they were even after she got poison oak from walking Meredith's dog in the woods. The two laughed over the incident. They divorced after Addison found a pair of women's underwear in Derek's pocket.\n\nAfter the divorce, Addison had to put Derek in a tiny box and make him petty and insignificant to get up in the morning.\n\n\nAddison had very little in Seattle after she and Derek divorced. Her marriage with Derek was over, her relationship with Mark had completely vanished, and her attempt at a relationship with [[Alex Karev]]\uafailed. She visited Los Angeles to see her friends [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]]\uaand\ua[[Sam Bennett]], also because Naomi was a fertility specialist.\uaNaomi offered her a position at\ua[[Oceanside Wellness Group]].\uaAddison returned to Los Angeles not long after that, taking Oceanside Wellness up on their job offer at their practice. One day, Addison searched through Naomi's files at the practice to read her file and found that her chances of becoming pregnant were worse than she'd previously imagined. She learned that her egg count was a mere two, and was heartbroken.\n\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|Addison returns to [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]]. ([[Piece of My Heart]])]] Later, Addison returned to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to treat a pregnant woman suffering from [[Piece_of_My_Heart#Medical_Notes|ectopia cordis]], in which the fetus's heart was growing outside of the body. Although she seemed somewhat happy to be back in Seattle, she made it clear that the visit wasn't permanent and she had every intention of returning to [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. Addison also showed that the history between her, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] was in the past as she was able to hug Meredith and be genuinely happy for them, unaware that they had broken up.\n\nDuring her stay, in which the surgeries on both mother and child were successful due to Addison, [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], and [[Erica Hahn|Erica's]] expertise, Addison was forced to realize that a lot had changed in her absence (particularly [[The Heart of the Matter|the breakdown of Callie and George's marriage]], [[A Change is Gonna Come|Meredith and Derek's break up]], and his [[Crash Into Me, Part |relationship with Rose]], as well as [[Lay Your Hands on Me|Bailey and Tucker's marital issues]].)\n\nWhen [[Richard Webber|the chief]] approached her and attempted to persuade her to stay at Seattle Grace, Addison told him that she now knew it was the right thing to leave and told him to fill her position. Before returning to Los Angeles, however, Addison went to [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's bar]] and warned [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] that, even though she was now zen, she wanted to \"kick her ass\" for not fighting for [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and allowing his new girlfriend to have the happily ever after that she deserved.<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb]] Addison's status in the dating world remained uncertain as she had been stood up by [[Kevin Nelson|Kevin]] after she went to find him at the station, and remained unaware that [[Pete Wilder|Pete]] had gone to her house the same night. Sometime later, Addison and [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]] found themselves at odds regarding Naomi allowing a couple to conceive a child through Naomi's fertility treatment who would act as an organ donor for their ill child. When the parents demanded Addison birth their child three months premature, an ethical debate raged between Addison and Naomi. Addison eventually learned Naomi agreed to help the couple due to the practice's financial trouble that she was concealing from the group. Despite Naomi's pleas, Addison told [[Sam Bennett|Sam]] that the practice was in trouble. At the same time, [[Kevin Nelson|Kevin]] returned for Addison to tell her that he stood her up to train for the SWAT team and the two flirted, leaving their future ambiguous.<ref>[[A Family Thing]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nArmed with the knowledge of the practice's struggles, Sam and Addison formed a hostile takeover of the leadership of the practice and each doctor worked to save the practice from extinction. Addison and Naomi's friendship, however, couldn't stand what Naomi saw to be a betrayal and Naomi cut her best friend out of her personal life, leaving only professional ties.<ref>[[Equal and Opposite]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nWith her 'family' at the practice in disarray, Addison took [[Charlotte King|Charlotte's]] offer to do some surgeries for [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose]], for her to relieve her frustrations which she claimed 'fall away' when she holds a scalpel. However, rushed off her feet and desperate to do nothing but cut Addison spent no time conversing with her patients and getting to know them. When a stressed and worried husband of a pregnant patient asked her what his wife's name was, and she was unable to answer, she realized that she had become the one who wasn't talking and decided to return to family at the practice for good, refuting Charlotte's offer to work at St. Ambrose full-time. This persuaded her to move forward with [[Kevin Nelson|Kevin]] as well as attempting to repair her friendship with Naomi.<ref>[[Nothing to Talk About]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] tells Addison and [[Archer Montgomery|Archer]] that the cysts are inoperable.]] Having landed in Seattle, a worried Addison was greeted by [[Richard Webber|Richard]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] as Archer was prepared for a diagnosis. Derek discovered eight cysts caused by the parasites and, having consulted specialists, revealed that they were inoperable as surgery would cause more harm than good. A reluctant Addison refused to give up on Archer and told Derek that she needed him to be a God. As she attempted to pray in the hospital chapel, Addison confessed to [[Callie Torres|Callie]] that she didn't believe God knew who she was, and so praying for a miracle was worthless. Her old friend then reminded her that she saves babies, and God knows who she is because of it. Having received the push from [[Sam Bennett|Sam]], Derek decided to do the surgery. Addison watched on tenterhooks as Derek attempted to remove the parasitic cysts. When removing the eighth and final one, it ruptured, allowing the parasite to dig further into his brain. Addison, however, faced much relief when the parasite was caught, extracted and Archer stabilized. To celebrate Derek's success the old friends visited the [[Emerald City Bar]], where they reminisced about [[Derek's Song|Derek's love song to Addison]]. Addison however, recognized that Derek was in her past, and, despite her gratitude, she had to once again make him petty and insignificant to move on with her life.<ref>[[Before and After]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Violet was attacked and gave\ua[[Lucas Wilder|her baby]]\uato\ua[[Pete Wilder|Pete]], Addison became one of the principal caregivers to Lucas. She filled the void left by his birth mother and was overjoyed at the prospect of having a baby of her own. However, after Violet recuperated, Addison told Pete to go back to her, and subsequently lost touch with Lucas. She was, once again, left without a child of her own.\n\n\nAs\ua[[Mark Sloan|Mark]]\uawanted the best care possible for his daughter\ua[[Sloan Riley|Sloan]]\uaand was unsure of\ua[[Elizabeth Chen|Elizabeth Chen's]]\uaabilities, he had Addison fly in for the surgery. When Addison was operating, she realized it would be riskier than she thought. She was confident she could continue successfully, but Mark insisted that she stop. However, he later traveled with Sloan to Los Angeles so Addison could perform it. She did so successfully.\n\n\nSince Callie and Addison were close friends, Addison flew back to Seattle, at\ua[[Richard Webber|Richard's]]\uarequest after hearing that Callie had been in a car accident. She later performed an emergency C-section on Callie and delivered her daughter,\ua[[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]], prematurely.<ref>[[Song Beneath the Song]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Naomi left, Addison went to therapy.\n\nThe night Pete had a heart attack, Addison sat with Lucas and kept him comfortable until Violet was contacted and returned from the airport. She assured him everything was going to be okay, as Sam and Amelia were the best people to take care of him. Despite Sam still not having changes his mind about having a baby, Addison decided to go ahead anyway and made an appointment with the best fertility specialist she could find in the city. That man turned out to be\ua[[Jake Reilly]], her anonymous date she met flirting over pineapples. She then wanted to quit, but Jake had no problem leaving their flirtation in the past. He promised her he'd give her a baby.<ref>[[God Laughs]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nNot long after, Jake turned out to be applying for Naomi's job at the practice. Addison, being in charge, was hesitant to hire him. Meanwhile, she informed Sam she was going off birth control, so she had him buy condoms. After Jake assured her he had no ulterior motive and promised not to flirt, Addison had to face that he was the best candidate and officially hired him. Addison told her therapist that she didn't need to tell Sam about her Fiji history with Jake, as they were broken up at the time, and admitted that she finally happy again.<ref>[[Breaking the Rules]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAddison started looking for IVF specialists to start the process. Needing someone to talk to, she grew closer to Violet, who also needed someone to talk to about her marriage problems. Sam later realized he needed to be there for his girlfriend and offered to listen to her talk about IVF specialists, but she told him she was fine. In therapy, she said she became a better and more generous person because of Sam.<ref>[[Deal With It]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nHowever, Addison soon realized she must be crazy to compartmentalize Sam and the baby, starting to fear Sam was going to leave her. She took her concerns to Jake after he told her some more about himself and his youth to make her trust him, but all Jake could tell her was to listen to her instincts. At night, she told Sam what she was worried about. He knew she was, but kissed her to tell her he wouldn't leave. However, in therapy, Addison still said she came to realize that maybe love means wanting the other person to be happy, even if they can't be with you.<ref>[[Remember Me]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAddison started the IVF process with fertility drugs and asked Jake to inject them as she wanted to stay sexy for Sam, so he couldn't do it for her. Addison tried to keep it secret in order not to become the office gossip, but that became difficult when she soon started suffering from mood swings and extreme emotional reactions to what was happening at the practice. Addison started thinking Sam was just dating her because she couldn't have children, but Jake assured her that was just the hormones. He did tell her she needed people on her side, as she couldn't go through it alone. She then told Sam that she started the IVF process with Jake's help. He once again stated he didn't want a new child because the experience of having a child is as awful at times as it is wonderful, so he was glad to have gotten through it with Maya. He assured Addison that didn't mean he stopped loving her, though. In therapy, Addison said she had to teach herself to have hope again.<ref>[[Step One]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nSoon after, Addison started looking for sperm donors, throwing out lots of candidates based on medical history alone. When she felt like she was drowning in files, Sam assured her she could make it happen. Addison asked her colleagues for help, but they all give her different advice. Addison received good news from Jake: they were able to retrieve  eggs, which needed to be picked that day. He'd contact a friend at the sperm bank to speed up the process, meaning they could fertilize the eggs that day. Sam came to support Addison when Jake would pick the eggs, but she was already under. She woke up with Sam by her side and started crying because she put herself in this position where a stranger was needed to get pregnant, all because she cheated. Sam convinced her the bad things didn't outweigh her good qualities, so she shouldn't punish herself. He advised her to pick the musician's sperm. She did pick him, and later that day, Jake fertilized the eggs with Addison watching.<ref>[[If I Hadn't Forgotten...]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nOver the three days the embryo had to grow in the lab, Addison kept checking on it. She wasn't allowed to have sex before the implantation, but Sam suggested they do \"other things\". She happily agreed to that. Meanwhile, Addison also met [[Ryan Kerrigan]]\uaand expressed her worries over Amelia, who assured Addison she was fine.\uaThe day after, Jake implanted the eggs. In therapy, Addison said she was thrilled and terrified that if all things went right, there could be an entire person with a full life ahead could be growing inside her. She was looking forward to sharing experiences with her child.<ref>[[Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAmelia went missing for  days, and when she showed up at the practice to announce her engagement to Ryan, Addison was both angry and relieved at the same time. Since Charlotte was convinced Amelia was using, they staged an intervention at the practice. Amelia started attacking them one by one and hit Addison's weak spot when she attacked her about her infertility and past abortion. Addison threatened to report Amelia to the medical board, throw her out of her house and change the locks, and call in her family, but the only thing that actually got Amelia to stay and listen was the oxy she demanded. The doctors gave her the oxy, which Amelia snorted off the reception desk. Right when Amelia seemed to cave to her friends' talks and agreed to go to rehab, Ryan arrived. The doctors suggested they also help Ryan, but a quarrel ensued when Addison noticed Ryan was wearing\ua[[Mr. Shepherd|Amelia's father's]]\uawatch. Amelia aggressively forbade her from telling that story and soon left with Ryan, leaving Addison to feel like the intervention was a bad idea. However, the next morning, Addison received a call about Amelia, who was ready to go rehab.<ref>[[Who We Are]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAddison helped her pack and drove her to the treatment center. Amelia, who has a great mother, had Addison think that even the best mothers' kids can go down the wrong path. Later that day, Addison received the news that she was not pregnant, but Jake assured her that didn't mean it was over. Sam seemed relieved about the news, so Violet agreed to hold her hand the next time she was going to try. Addison came up with a crazy plan that included a lot of fertility drugs. She wanted to try again with fresh sperm and fresh eggs, even though she had two frozen eggs left herself. Addison took Sam to therapy with her as he needed to face there would be a baby in her life soon, but he said that was not a problem yet and that he wanted Addison. Two weeks later, Addison collapsed at the practice as a side-effect to the hormone treatment. That made her decide that the embryo transfer would be it: she'd either be pregnant or not. After she was fully recovered, they did the transfer. On Thanksgiving, Addison did a pregnancy test.<ref>[[The Breaking Point]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nIn\ua[[If/Then|Meredith's dream]], Derek and Addison are still in an unhappy marriage and Addison is pregnant with their child, though the child is later revealed to be [[Mark Sloan|Mark's]]. Also, Addison is still part of the surgical staff at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and remains the [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] and [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal]] [[Attending#Department Head|head]].\n\n\nMere hours after delivering a baby at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]], Addison got a call from her social worker saying that a birth mom had chosen her. She returned to the hospital, shocked to find that it was [[Judi]], the same woman whose baby she had delivered. Judi had decided she couldn't find a better mom for the baby, and that it must have been fate since Addison was the one who delivered the baby boy. Addison named him [[Henry Montgomery]].\n\n\nAddison lost her way during the pandemic. Two months into the first lockdown, Jake and Henry were bickering about Game of Thrones and Addison couldn't bare it anymore, seriously considering to leave Jake. She got up off the couch, got in her car, and started driving for two hours before she stopped and asked herself what she was doing. Addison started to over-indulged in wine. Henry became obsessed with video games and Jake took up a model train hobby, which truly delighted him much to Addison's surprise. She grew increasingly uneasy spending so much time at home and at one point even considered checking herself into rehab for her drinking habits. She went even darker and started daydreaming about going to sleep and never waking up, which comforted her. Eventually, she came up with a research project on uterine transplants and met [[Tovah Freedman]]. The drive to help Tovah motivated Addison to pull herself back together and get out of bed every morning.\n\nAs part of her research, Addison eventually travelled to Seattle to perform a uterine transplant on Tovah, who had her support system in Seattle. Addison reached out to Richard if there was an OR available for her and agreed to make her return a grand rounds teaching opportunity for the residents, whom he mentioned were behind. On the day of the surgery, Seattle was going through a heatwave.\n\nAddison arrived at the skills lab to introduce herself to the group of residents. En route to the patient, she explained her research and quizzed Levi on the pelvic anatomy. When he answered correctly, she allowed him to present the case and upon seeing a connection between him and the Jewish patient, she chose him to scrub in with her along with Richard. The other residents gathered in the gallery to observe and Addison kept them engaged with a multitude of questions. In the middle of the procedure, the HVAC system broke down. The temperature in the OR quickly rose yet Addison refused to close up the patient despite Richard's warning about the risk of infection. To work faster, Addison requested Meredith due to her experience with microvascular anastomosis of the abdomen. Meredith soon joined her in the OR and they congratulated one another on their professional accomplishments. As they operated, Addison asked Meredith what big thing was next for her. Meredith revealed that she had some idea but she needed to sort out things logistically and have a difficult conversation with Richard. After evacuating a clot, Meredith and Addison successfully finished the procedure. As they left the OR, they heard the residents gossiping about the tension between them.\n[[File:xMeredithComfortsAddison.png|thumb|Meredith comforts Addison after opening up to one another.]]\nHowever, once alone on the elevator with Meredith, Addison broke down crying because coming here made Derek's death all too real for her. Meredith said he was there and in her kids is well, whom she invited Addison to meet over dinner at her house. Addison then told Meredith to fight for this big project if she believed in it, stating Meredith had never been one to shy away to fight for what she loved.\n\nAfterward, Addison went to check on Tovah in the ICU. Everything was well. Richard congratulated her and Addison told him the residents were not as bad as he had made them out to be. He couldn't help but point out the difference between the current generation and Addison and Derek's generation, stating the current residents complained a lot. Addison pointed out they were simply standing up for themselves and refusing to be worked to death in a system that could be considered inhumane. She considered that progress and stated there was always room for improvement in the medical education system. He agreed and told her he was glad to see her again. Addison then finally met up with Amelia in the lobby. After a long hug, Addison told her about Meredith's invitation. Amelia took her home and introduced her to Zola and Bailey. Addison got emotional upon meeting them and sat down with them to have ice cream for dinner.<ref>[[Hotter Than Hell]], x</ref>\n\nThe day after, en route to the airport, Addison was notified that Tovah had had a seizure in the ICU. Addison rushed back to the hospital and enlisted Amelia's help to figure out what was causing the seizures. Addison was panicking because Tovah's sister had begged her not to participate in the trial and it could mean that they would have to remove the uterus, meaning all had been for nothing. As they awaited the MRI scan, Amelia confided in Addison as to why she had left Scout's father. Upon hearing that Amelia had struggled so hard during the pandemic, Addison relayed her own experiences, which comforted Amelia. Eventually, they found that the seizure had been due to neurotoxicity from the anti-rejection medication. They decided to switch the meds and start anticonvulsants. Addison needed Amelia to tell her that Tovah would be okay as she absolutely prioritized Tovah's life over her study. Amelia pointed out that Tovah had loved her husband so much that she entered Addison's trial, very much aware of the risks it entailed. Tovah recovered in the ICU and Addison happily informed her that there was still a chance for her to have her husband's baby. On her way out, Addison recalled her frustration with Jake and posed that a slight mental health crisis doesn't make for good decision making. Amelia stated she stayed with Link through the pandemic because she deemed herself crazy to leave a good guy but she wasn't feeling crazy now nor did she feel the need to get high; she realized she just didn't want a ring or more babies, so she thought it the kindest and sanest thing to let him go. Addison smiled and commented that Amelia was all grown up now.<ref>[[With a Little Help From My Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\nAddison is a very confident, smart, and poised woman. She can be described as cold and unforgiving, however, she is also quite warm and kind. She is also very concentrated and dedicated to her work, as she is considered the best in her field. Addison is sometimes difficult and uncompromising but she can be very kind and accepting.\n\nAddison describes herself as a worrier; she constantly worries about what's happening and what's not happening. Professionally, she is very confident, but not personally. She likes to think that worrying prepares her for whatever may happen.\n\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek and Addison attempting to give their relationship another try.]]\n\nAddison met her future husband, [[Derek Shepherd]], in [[Medical School|medical school]] in the summer. Their relationship grew and they eventually married. Derek once wrote [[Derek's Song|a song]] for her.\n\nAfter medical school, Addison and Derek became extremely successful in their respective fields and each began their own practice in [[New York]]. However, this strained their marriage.\n\nAddison was married to Derek Shepherd for eleven years before eventually sleeping with Derek's best friend, [[Mark Sloan]], which prompted Derek to leave [[New York]] for [[Seattle]] at the request of their old friend and mentor, [[Richard Webber]].\n\nAfter she and Derek initially separated, she tried to get over him, even hoping that dying her hair blond would help. She remained in New York and lived with Mark for two months, during which she became pregnant with Mark's child but she chose to have an abortion. The relationship ended when Mark cheated on Addison and [[Richard Webber]] brought her to Seattle Grace for a consult on a difficult case.\n\nAfter a period of antagonism between her and Derek (in which he continually referred to her as \"Satan\"), Addison decided to stay on as the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Neonatal Surgery and OB/GYN at Seattle Grace, signing a two-year contract after she and Derek decided to make an effort to work things out. Addison was unaware that Derek still had feelings for [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]].\n\nWhen Addison discovered that her husband slept with Meredith at the hospital-sponsored prom, Addison (in a drunken haze) called Mark Sloan to Seattle. She and Derek agreed that their marriage was over and started divorce proceedings. She asked Mark to go back to New York, but he stayed, expressing his desire to continue their relationship.\n\nWhen the divorce was finalized, Addison dropped the \"Shepherd\" from her last name. Wanting to make a fresh start, Derek happily relinquished most of their shared properties (their [[Brownstone]] in [[Manhattan]] and a residence in [[The Hamptons]]) to her believing that she deserved it as his initial impression was that she had only had a one-night stand with Mark while he carried on an affair with Meredith.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShe stayed in Seattle for a long while after and a possibility of a relationship between her and [[Alex Karev]] was hinted at when they kissed in [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's bar]]. She felt it was too strange though and he said he didn't care so the relationship was not brought ahead any further.\n\nDuring the  days that Mark and Addison were trying to remain celibate to give themselves a chance, she slept with Alex. However, despite Addison wanting more, he wasn't ready for that.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Addison sleeps with Mark]] Addison and Mark originally met in med school. She cheated on her husband, Derek, with him. After Derek left for Seattle, Addison and Mark lived together for two months, during which time she became pregnant. She had an abortion, and Mark eventually cheated on her.\n\nAfter finding out Meredith and Derek slept together at the prom, she called Mark over to Seattle and slept with him again. Mark decided to move to Seattle in hopes of pursuing a relationship with Addison.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the day she discovered she was pregnant, Addison and Mark made a deal. If they both could abstain from sex for  days she would be willing to try a real relationship with him. She doesn't hold up her end of the bargain when she engaged in a sexual encounter with Alex at the hospital. Mark learned of this after witnessing them stumbling out of an on-call room. She was spared from confessing, however, when Mark selflessly lied to her by telling her he had broken their promise long before. He felt that although he had feelings for her, she shouldn't have to feel guilty.\n\nMark visited Addison in LA when his daughter, Sloan Riley, needed surgery. They had sex several times, which prompted Addison to ask Mark if he truly wanted to have a relationship with her because she could make it work. However, Mark was still in love with Lexie, so he apologized to Addison and turned her down.\n\n[[Pete Wilder]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Addison and Pete kiss.]] When she left [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] for a [[Oceanside Wellness Group|private practice]] in L.A, she had a brief interest in her co-worker [[Pete Wilder|Pete]] (whom she kissed) but gave up on any potential romance between the two after Pete stood her up for a date.\n\nLater, Pete and Addison reconnected at a hospital event and went back to her house to have pizza and watch lame TV shows, and ended up having sex. They started a relationship that they described as \"helping each other\" and Addison decided to move on from [[Sam Bennett|Sam]] since he was seemingly happy with his new girlfriend, making them officially a couple.\n\nWhen Pete was sick and Addison was looking after Lucas, Pete said \"I love you, [[Violet Turner|Violet]]\" to Addison while on fever medication, leading Addison to confront Pete six weeks later. Pete states that he will always love Violet as she is the mother of his child, but he wants to be with Addison.\ua\n\nViolet returns from Costa Rica and Addison tells her that Pete will pick her because she is Lucas' mother.\ua\n\nLater on the porch, Sam tells Addison he is sick of doing the right thing and should do the wrong thing, and then kisses her as Pete walks in.\ua\n\n[[Kevin Nelson]]\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb|Kevin and Addison sharing lunch in between surgeries.|xpx]] Addison was then asked out by [[Kevin Nelson]], a police officer. Unfortunately, her trust issues interfered with her and Kevin, issues that resulted in her jealously following Kevin after she thought he was having an affair and ending with her arrest by the SWAT team. Nonetheless, she confessed her issues to Kevin and they resumed their relationship.\n\nBut more troubles came when [[Archer Montgomery|Addison's brother]] came to visit and told Kevin that she was just \"enjoying him\". When he hadn't called Addison back; she had thought he was avoiding her, but would find out he had been shot. When her brother left; Kevin moved in with her while he was recovering. While Addison now had to deal with Charlotte who was opening up a competing practice on the fourth floor, she was more annoyed by [[Wyatt Lockhart|Dr. Wyatt Lockhart]], a doctor working for Charlotte's practice who steals a patient of Addison's and convinces Naomi to work for her. In the midst of this relationship, Addison and Kevin's different lifestyles get in the way of their relationship leading to him moving out. But Addison later calls him telling him she misses him, and they make up.\n\nHowever, Addison kisses Wyatt after seeing him for who he really is, not the arrogant, headline grabber she thought he was. Kevin repeatedly questions her where she was that night and believes she's lying, Addison claims she was working, and just as Kevin was finally able to drop the questioning, she admits she kissed another man, and they break up. As Addison goes to Wyatt to try a new relationship, she catches Naomi having sex with Archer instead.\n\n[[Noah Barnes]]\nNoah and Addison frequently met in the scrub room over three months, one of them always finishing surgery and scrubbing out and one scrubbing in, leading to their greeting of \"Finishing or starting?\". They both continued to flirt, not knowing each other's names, and eventually meet in the doctor's lounge where Noah asks for her name. Looking shocked, he quickly leaves.\n\nAddison later meets him as the husband of one of her pregnant patients, Morgan Gellman. Upon this discovery, Addison quickly removed herself from Morgan's case, as she was not comfortable with her feelings for Noah while she treated his wife, feelings which Noah reciprocates. Addison decides not to make a move in their relationship, refusing to be a homewrecker, after her past mistakes with her ex-husband and his best friend. Noah, however, asks her not to leave the case, as she is the best in her field and Morgan cannot lose another child (she had a string of miscarriages before seeing Addison), and he will keep his feelings for Addison in check. However, Noah cannot help the way he feels, and Morgan realizes her marriage is in jeopardy, asking Addison to save her child, as that is all that is keeping her and Noah together. She says she sees it in Noah's eyes, he's there, but he's not quite there. When Addison has to perform surgery on Morgan, Noah is not there for her and Morgan is willing to put off the surgery to have Addison find Noah and he eventually does go into the OR to be there for Morgan, with a push from Addison.\n\n[[Sam Bennett]]\nSam asked Addison out when they were in med school, but Addison declined because [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]] was in love with him. When Addison moved to LA, she bought the house next door to Sam, leading to their developing friendship.\ua\n\nAddison and Sam kissed after a hiking experience gone wrong while discussing what would have happened had Addison said yes to Sam in med school. They kissed twice more and Sam propositioned Addison to develop their relationship, but Addison said no because Naomi was her best friend.\n\nSam dated another [[Pediatrics|Neonatal]] surgeon, leading Addison to date [[Pete Wilder|Pete]], although she still loved Sam, and she is seen constantly talking about him to Pete. Sam and Addison had an off and on relationship for a long time. \ua\n\nThe main reason for their relationship troubles was that Addison wanted a child, but Sam had Maya, and Maya's daughter, and didn't want more kids. After Addison adopted Henry, Sam seemingly accepted Henry. He even asked her to marry him after Addison and Jake had had sex.\ua\n\n[[Jake Reilly]]\nWhen Addison's therapist told her to make a change in her life, she met Jake and they flirted over pineapples at the grocery store. They started seeing each other at a coffee shop. However, they both agreed to keep their identities in secret. Jake was going on vacation to Fiji and he asked Addison to come with him. She eventually accepted, but when at the airport, she realized it wasn't right to try to avoid Sam and the problems the practice was suffering.\n\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb|left|Addison and Jake at their wedding.]] Later on, Addison started her fertility treatment only to find out her doctor was Jake. He admitted he never left for Fiji. Addison, humiliated, left the office.\n\nWhen Jake interviewed for the fertility specialist opening at Oceanside Wellness, Addison was horrified because she recognized him as her former doctor. She was strongly opposed to the practice hiring him, but she ran out of excuses not to, as he was the perfect candidate for the job. Jake began working at the practice, and Addison made him not mention their previous encounters to Sam, who she was dating at the time of Jake's arrival.\n\nAddison began fertility treatments with Jake as her doctor. He helped her through her two failed IVFs and also to try to find a surrogate.\n\nShe once threw herself at him at an OB/GYN convention in Palm Springs. She was extremely drunk and stumbled into his hotel room, where she asked him if he wanted to sleep with her. He turned her down, saying that it was the alcohol talking and that she would regret it in the morning. When Addison woke the following morning, she remembered what had happened and was thoroughly embarrassed.\n\nJake once asked her if their relationship was purely physical because he cared about her, but she was sending him mixed signals. Addison confirmed that it was not just physical, but also emotional. Their relationship grew over time. When Jake was talking to his daughter, Angela, he told her that it wasn't Addison sending the mixed signals; it was him.\n\nAddison proposed to Jake shortly before Henry's adoption, and was thoroughly humiliated when he didn't answer; but after a talk with the ghost of his late wife, he accepted. They later got married.\n\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Addison and Callie.]] Since arriving at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], Addison has made many friendships with other hospital staff, most notably [[Callie Torres]] and [[Miranda Bailey]] (Miranda's reasons being that Addison smells nice, she's polite, and she saves babies). Her friendship with the two ladies has often been based on the fact that they act as each other's confidantes. Callie and Addison often discuss their current relationships and love lives, which has ultimately led to a very close friendship between the two. Addison is also very good friends with fellow attending, [[Preston Burke]], and her ex-husband, [[Derek Shepherd]]. She had a good friendship with [[Mark Sloan]] and a father-daughter bond with [[Richard Webber]] as she is often portrayed to be very close to him. The only intern that Addison really bonded with was [[Alex Karev]] but she had no grudges against any of the interns and even hugged [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] as a sign of acceptance of her relationship with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]. She helped inspire [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] to become a fighter again.\n\nAddison is believed to have had a good relationship with the Shepherd family, in particular, [[Nancy Shepherd]], but, pending Derek's revelation of the true extent of Addison/Mark's relationship, her closeness to the Shepherds is in doubt.\n\n[[Image:TheGang.jpg|thumb|left|px|Addison, Derek, Mark, Sam and Naomi at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]].]]\n\nAfter moving to [[Los Angeles|L.A.]], Addison returned to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to help with a patient whose fetus\us heart was growing out of its body. Upon her return, Addison didn't expect much change; but soon learned that since her departure a lot had changed - for example, the break up of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and his relationship with [[Rose]], Callie's divorce and the breakdown of Bailey's marriage. During her stay there she met [[Callie Torres|Callie's]] new friend [[Erica Hahn]] and mistakenly interpreted their friendship as a relationship. The mother and child both survived the surgery and Addison prepared to leave Seattle and return to L.A, telling [[Richard Webber|Richard]] that she needed to come back to see how much she liked her new life. She left, but not before finding Meredith and telling her that she wasn't allowed to let Derek get away.\n\nAddison betrayed Naomi by confronting Sam with something about the practice. Naomi dropped her friendship with Addison and refused to talk to her. Eventually, she and Naomi began to mend their friendship and at last came back to being best friends. Addison (despite her rocky start) got on well with her new colleagues and friendships were rekindled (as she was friends with Naomi and Sam years ago), friendships were started (Violet, Dell, and Coop) and even a short time relationship occurred (with her now friend, Pete). When Naomi left for New York, Addison and Violet became very close, discussing relationship woes and Lucas situations, and just generally they were pretty close. When Amelia came to L.A., she and Addison had a very sisterly relationship.\n\n\nAddison is considered one of the best surgeons in her field in the world, having patients travel across the country to receive medical and surgical care from her, helped by her excellent bedside manner. She formerly worked at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], before her relocation to [[Los Angeles]] to join a private practice. When she relocated, her surgical practice became limited, with her practice being mostly obstetric work and occasional genetic counseling with Naomi. However, she does have surgical privileges at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]], allowing her to conduct her own surgeries, which is a right she exercises frequently. [[Charlotte King]] also calls on Addison to consult and take on complex medical cases from the hospital, which increases her OR time.\n\nShe completed her [[Resident|surgical residency]] under the supervision of her now good friend, [[Richard Webber]]. During her residency, Richard gave Addison a patient who would not survive, to teach Addison to not get too emotionally involved with her patients, as a result, Addison avoided Richard for almost a year. As an attending, she repeated the same trick with [[Izzie Stevens]] and one of the quintuplets the hospital was taking care of.\n\nDuring her [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN residency]], Addison was mentored by [[Vivian Carlsmith|Dr. Vivian Carlsmith]], a world-renowned OB/GYN , and pioneer in [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]]. Addison was Vivian's smartest student, eventually surpassing Vivian's skill.\n\nAddison's training also encompasses why she is regarded as one of the best surgeons in her field: she is [[Board Certification|board certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology|obstetrics and gynecology with her sub-specialty in maternal-fetal medicine]], board-certified in [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]], and has completed a [[Fellow|fellowship]] in [[Medical Genetics|medical genetics]], specializing in cystic fibrosis. She is very open about her credentials and has relayed them to patients, co-workers, and subordinates that have doubted her abilities.\n\nSurgically, she is highly skilled in complex, often laparoscopic and open, obstetrical, gynecological, neonatal and [[Fetal Surgery|fetal]] surgeries. She is one of the few surgeons in the world who can separate fetal blood vessels and correct Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which she has special expertise in. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Addison treats a patient at Seattle Grace Hospital.]] She was formerly the [[Attending#Department Head|attending surgeon]] in charge of a world-class [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]] and state-of-the-art OB/GYN wing at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Although a highly successful and well-paid job, Addison left Seattle to go to L.A to join a private practice.\n\nWhen she arrived at the practice she was surprised to discover that Naomi, who gave her the job offer, didn't tell the rest of the staff about Addison. The other doctors showed Addison that she was clearly not welcome. On her first day in the practice, she performed surgery in an unsterilized delivery room only with the help of Alternative Medicine Specialist, Pete. On the end of the same day, they decided to vote on whether Addison should join the practice or not but Addison put her foot down and told them that she was going to stay even if they wanted her gone. Everyone was impressed by her speech and they decided not to vote after all.\n\n[[Image:PPSCast.jpg|thumb|right|px|The main staff of the Oceanside Wellness Group, and [[Charlotte King]], Chief of Staff at [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose]].]]\n\nWhen [[Richard Webber]] asked Addison to [[Piece of My Heart|return for a complex surgery]], she agreed, and at the end of the day, Richard attempts to get her back and letting her start the next morning. Addison declined the offer, being sure that leaving was the right thing to do. Similarly, when Naomi would not speak to Addison, Addison took several surgeries at [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose]] to relieve her frustrations. [[Charlotte King|Charlotte]] tried to woo her to the hospital with the surgeries but Addison declared the practice as her 'home'.\n\nNot long after moving to Los Angeles, Addison learned that [[Oceanside Wellness Group|the practice]] was failing financially so confronted Sam and the two formed a hostile takeover. In a bid to get the practice back to how it used to be Addison accidentally prompted a vote between [[Sam Bennett|Sam]] and [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]], but was stunned when she was elected to lead the practice as Addison's leadership shone through.\n\nLater, Addison dissolved the practice, funded the change, and renamed it to [[Seaside Health and Wellness]].\n\n\n*She was  when she moved to [[Los Angeles]].<ref>[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]], x</ref>\n*When Derek left her in New York, Addison dyed her hair blonde.<ref>[[Walk on Water]], x</ref>\n*Since moving to L.A, Addison describes herself as very zen. She buys aromatherapy candles and takes walks on beaches.\n*When she worked at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], her salary made her one of the highest-paid surgeons in the Northwestern United States.\n*Addison performs abortions. She believes life only begins when the baby can survive outside the mother's body, thus at birth.<ref>[[Crime and Punishment]], x (PP)</ref>\n*During her education, Addison always hated neuroanatomy.\n*Addison's SGH ID badge stated her departments were [[Obstetrics and Gynecology]] and [[Neonatology]].\n*Addison sometimes wears reading glasses.<ref>[[Staring at the Sun]], x</ref>\n*She has a lucky [[Scrubs|scrub cap]].\n*Addison has a very close sisterly relationship with [[Amelia Shepherd]], as Addison took her to get her ears pierced, she did her hair for prom, and she explained to her how to use birth control when Amelia didn't know who to ask.\n*Before she was officially a part of the [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] attending staff, she wore salmon scrubs. Whether or not she owned these scrubs or if she was wearing the uniform color of OB/GYNs remains unclear. Kate Walsh stated in an interview that it was decided to let Addison wear the navy blue scrubs to make her more part of the attendings group.\n*Whenever Addison wants to tell something that she cannot tell, she stares at the person she wants to tell.\n*Addison and her family are WASPs - they only go to Church on Christmas, and she does not know how to pray.<ref>[[Before and After]], x</ref>\n*Addison rarely mentions being a WASP during her time as a series regular on Grey's Anatomy but talks about it quite often in Private Practice. However, when she mentions it in GA, she is referring to the Protestant aspect, whereas she mainly uses the term in PP to discuss the culture of her childhood and family, in the social group aspect.\n*It has been noted that Addison's qualifications are unrealistic for a practicing doctor in her late-s/early-s, as she has already gained a highly-regarded reputation at her character's introduction to the series. Since Derek and she attended medical school together and were both educated by Richard Webber, it is likely she completed a -year residency in general surgery followed by a -year fellowship in pediatric surgery focusing on neonatal and fetal surgical procedures, returning to complete a -year residency in obstetrics and gynecology followed by a -year fellowship in maternal-fetal medicine, with her (likely to be) -year fellowship in medical genetics following everything else. In reality, under the best circumstances, this would make Addison a minimum of  years old.\n**It has been indicated throughout seasons five and six of ''[[Private Practice]]'' that Addison first completed a residency in [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]]. This would mean that she followed up with fellowships in maternal-fetal medicine and medical genetics, then completed a general surgery residency and finished with a pediatric surgery fellowship focusing on neonatal and fetal surgeries. If this is indeed the case, this creates a continuity-error with her being mentored by Richard, as stated in ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', as OB/GYN residents do not rotate in other surgical departments; this would be plausible if Richard were somehow involved in Addison's OB/GYN residency.\n*Addison appeared in every single episode of\ua''[[Private Practice]]'', except for\ua[[Two Steps Back]]\uaand\ua[[The Hardest Part]].\n*Although incorrect, [[Jake Reilly|Dr. Jake Reilly]] referred to Addison as a [[Neonatology|neonatologist]].<ref>[[Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Addison is the first and last character to be seen on ''Private Practice''. The first scene of the show is her talking to Richard about her resignation, and the last scene of the show is the group talking in the kitchen in the practice, with her face being the last one to be seen from inside the elevator before its doors close completely.\n*In one college semester, she took classes in organic chemistry, physics II, multivariable calculus, conversational French, introduction to the modern European novel, and tennis. She later had to retake tennis due to getting an incomplete.\n*She's one of only eight people in the world who can perform [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]], [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|perinatology]], and [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]] on a world-class level.\n*She loves bacon cheeseburgers.\n*She has a cat named [[Milo (Cat)|Milo]], formerly owned by her patient [[Lillie Jordan]].\n*She wore a sea turtle scrub cap for her first solo surgery.\n*She used to have a pet hermit crab, but the air filter was noisy so she shut it off, and it died.<ref>[[Slip Slidin' Away]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Her fortune is about  million dollars.\n*She has a thing for Russell Crowe.<ref>[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]], x</ref>\n*She is not a fan of bread.<ref>[[With a Little Help From My Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nAddisonMontgomery.png\nPPAddisonMontgomery.png\nPPxAddisonMontgomery.png\nPPxAddisonMontgomery.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Addison-centric or otherwise very informative about her life.\n*[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\n*[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\n*[[Time Has Come Today]]\n*[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\n*[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\n*[[In Which We Meet Addison, a Nice Girl From Somewhere Else]]\n*[[In Which Addison Finds the Magic]]\n*[[In Which Addison Has a Very Casual Get Together]]\n*[[In Which Addison Finds a Showerhead]]\n*[[Before and After]]\n*[[Ex-Life]]\n*[[The Hard Part]]\n*[[Home Again]]\n*[[Apron Strings]]\n*[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\n*[[Hotter Than Hell]]\n*[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\n\n\n:'''Addison (to [[Jake Reilly|Jake]]):''' I love you.

He fell onto the floor and was trampled. His ear was torn off and his spine was fractured in the chaos.\n\nHe was brought to the ER where his injuries were assessed. Mark said that he could reconstruct his eat using cartilage from other parts of his body. Keith was unable to feel his feet, so he was sent for an MRI.\n\nHe had surgery to repair his spine. However, after his surgery, he found out that Greg had sold the TARDIS and lashed out, re-injuring his spine. He had to be taken back into surgery to repair the bleed. Since his ear had already been detached for  hours, Mark was worried about it staying viable so it could be re-attached.

She is the youngest sister of [[Derek Shepherd]] and was officially employed at [[Seaside Health and Wellness]] with privileges at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]]. She later relocated to [[Seattle]] and took over Derek's job as the Head of Neurosurgery at Grey Sloan. While in Los Angeles, she was engaged to [[Ryan Kerrigan]] until his death and later to [[James Peterson]] until she moved to Seattle. After moving to Seattle, she had a short-lived marriage to [[Owen Hunt]]. She was in a relationship with [[Atticus Lincoln]] with whom she has a son, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]]. She is currently entertaining a new relationship with [[Kai Bartley]].\n\n\n\nWhen she was , she and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] witnessed their father's murder in his convenience store. She said that afterward her world fell apart and she was in a \"dark place\" for a long time. When she was , she was obsessed with unicorns because they were magical and could do great things.<ref name=\":\">[[Gone, Baby, Gone]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nDuring her teenage years, she was so wild and out of control that she earned the nickname 'Hurricane Amelia'. To escape her pain, she began abusing pills after a friend offered her one. She overdosed and was dead for  minutes until Derek saved her life. This experience urged her to get sober, which she maintained to be for many years. She said it lasted so long that her studious nature made her spend \"the bulk of her twenties in a library\".<ref name=\":\">[[Who We Are]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nShe walked in on [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and her (then) sister-in-law [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] in bed together but kept it secret from her brother, Derek.\n\n\nPart of [[Geraldine Ginsberg|Dr. Geraldine Ginsberg's]] team, Amelia joined her boss in Los Angeles to consult on [[Kayla Lindy|Kayla Lindy's]] case, knowing she would meet her former sister-in-law [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], as her name was all over the case. Dr. Ginsberg found there was nothing she could do for Kayla, but Amelia firmly offered the family an option of hope in the form of an experimental surgery. Geraldine promptly fired Amelia from her team for stepping up to her, but Kayla's husband asked Amelia to perform the surgery. \n\n\nDespite not having talked to him for a while, when Amelia heard that [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] got shot, she was so shocked by this that she started smoking. [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] took her cigarettes away when they were going to visit [[Dell Parker|Dell's]] grave, where Amelia mentioned that the world was a crappy place because of the horrible things that happened lately, like Dell's death and Derek being shot. When she got bored at Addison's house, she visited the practice, hoping there was a patient she could operate on. She spoke to Addison and told her that she called and e-mailed Derek to find out how he was doing, but he did not return her calls, nor did he reply to her e-mails. Addison then told her that he was doing fine. Amelia was surprised that Derek had talked to Addison, while he hadn't talked to her. \"That kinda says it all, doesn't it?\" Amelia said. When Amelia later told Addison that she wanted to go somewhere, Addison told her to start in [[Seattle]] and convinced her that Derek already hated her, so she had nothing to lose by visiting him. \"I'm gonna start in Seattle,\" Amelia then said.<ref>[[Take Two]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAmelia approached [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]] about a job at the practice, referring to herself as a kick-ass, world-class catch. Naomi asked Amelia why she would want to join the practice, as it was a much smaller and conservative gig than she was used to. Initially, Amelia claimed that the practice would be a good environment to broaden her skill set, but Naomi told her not to give the rehearsed answer. Amelia admitted that she had nowhere else to go where she was not alone. The next day, Naomi hired Amelia to work at the practice.<ref>[[Playing God]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAt Charlotte and Cooper's wedding, Amelia, as the maid of honor, took an accidental sip of champagne, mistaking it for the ginger ale she had ordered at the wedding reception. She immediately spit it out, but the accidental slip sparked her craving for alcohol again.<ref>[[Something Old, Something New]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAmelia really started craving alcohol again and went to tell Charlotte about her accidental slip. Charlotte told her not to let it turn into an actual fall as it was just an accident.<ref>[[God Bless the Child]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nBehind Charlotte's back, Amelia did start drinking again and operated on a man drunk. Charlotte soon found out and revoked Amelia's surgical privileges at the hospital, thus effectively removing Amelia from the surgical rotation.<ref>[[...To Change the Things I Can]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAmelia fully gave into her craving and got drunk at a bar. She was dancing on the bar when a quarrel with another woman caused her to fall off the bar and cut her hand open. As the bartender took away her keys, she called Sheldon, who drove her to the hospital. Amelia stitched up her own hand after Sheldon numbed it. Amelia, being the best neurosurgeon, was paged as Pete required brain surgery. Amelia ignored Charlotte's objections and operated, claiming Pete didn't have the time to wait for the other neurosurgeon. The surgery went well and Amelia went to Charlotte to tell her she never had problems with booze, but Charlotte took that as a sign she was in trouble and informed her that her privileges were still revoked. Sheldon then drove Amelia home.<ref>[[God Laughs]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAs Addison moved in with Sam, Amelia had the house to herself and threw a housewarming party. She claimed she didn't drink at the party, though, and showed Charlotte her -day sobriety chip later that day. Charlotte said she'd think about putting her back on the surgical rotation, angering Amelia, as she only opened up about her addiction struggles because Charlotte needed her to. She felt like Charlotte was punishing her harder than she'd do to other people. After a talk with Sheldon, Charlotte followed the book and had Amelia take a breathalyzer test. It was negative, so Charlotte welcomed her back on the surgical rotation. Amelia stated she'd be going to a meeting, but rather go alone. However, that night, Amelia drank an entire bottle of wine by herself while watching TV.<ref>[[Breaking the Rules]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAmelia returned to AA, humiliated to be back at day , realizing she had things to lose in her life. Charlotte, meanwhile, kept checking up on Amelia, who called her a bitch for being so controlling.<ref>[[Deal With It]], x (PP)</ref> Amelia made it to  days, which she told Sheldon was a start.<ref>[[Remember Me]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAfter six months in Italy, [[Michelle]] returned to Los Angeles as her symptoms had progressed. She reminded Amelia of her promise to help her die once that happened. Amelia brought it up to her colleagues, and they reminded her that's considered murder in California, despite the fact that it may be the right thing to do to stop Michelle's suffering. Amelia decided to do it anyway and administer drugs that would end Michelle's life. They had decided they'd pretend that Amelia found her after staging an overdose of pills. Amelia started injecting the drugs, but Michelle had a bad reaction and told her to stop. She was taken to the ER, where Pete managed to save her life. Amelia later made a pact with Michelle to move in together, so she could care for Michelle, who in return could help her to stay sober. However, that night, Amelia went to Michelle's house for a girl's night, only to find Michelle dead on her bed, having taken an overdose of pills for real. Amelia called the cops and swallowed some pills with wine as soon as they left.<ref>[[Step One]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nMichelle's death pushed her over the edge. She started partying hard. One morning, Amelia woke up with a handsome, but unknown man next to her. She threw him out to go to work. She did another breathalyzer test at the hospital, which was negative. Charlotte offered her a leave of absence to mourn Michelle's death, but Amelia just wanted Charlotte off her back. Amelia went home \"sick\" and found out the man hadn't left and was sitting on her deck. They formally introduced themselves as they couldn't remember their first encounter. Amelia then had sex with Ryan again. Knowing she truly liked him, Ryan then revealed he had pills. They cut them up and inhaled the powder. One of Amelia's patients required emergency surgery, but Amelia didn't answer her phone as she and Ryan were high in bed. That night, Amelia wrote them a prescription for more pills, which Ryan went to get at the pharmacy. Charlotte, having figured out that the breathalyzer test was negative because Amelia had started to take pills again, showed up at the house right when Ryan returned from the pharmacy. Charlotte wanted to tell Amelia off, but Amelia simply stated she quit her job and closed the door on her.<ref>[[If I Hadn't Forgotten...]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nThe next morning, Addison dropped by and met Ryan. Amelia told her she took the day off to be with Ryan. They bumped into Cooper and Mason at a taco stand, where Cooper noticed a rude-ish Amelia didn't look well. Addison dropped by again that night, as she and the others were worried about her. Amelia didn't want a lecture and told Addison they stopped being family when Addison cheated on her brother, so Addison could stop worrying over her. Amelia and Ryan fled to a hotel, where they got to know each other better. She forgot to pack her prescription pad, so she had to go to the practice to get another. She forgot to turn the alarm off, so the police busted her. Charlotte, being on call for the practice, showed up and confirmed Amelia was a doctor at the practice. The officers left, and Charlotte asked Amelia for the prescription pad she knew Amelia had come to pick up. Amelia gave her one, told Charlotte to stay out of her life, and revealed she had another prescription pad in her pocket as the elevator doors closed. Back at the hotel, Amelia came down and discovered that Ryan had invited friends over, who thanked her for the scripts. Ryan threw them out as they made Amelia feel uncomfortable. At night, he and Amelia started using intravenous drugs.<ref>[[Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] and the others at Seaside Wellness staged an intervention. They attempted to talk to her but she was too angry and aggressive to properly listen. After a lot of rude and insulting comments towards her friends, hitting them in their weak spots about their problems, Amelia eventually suffered from withdrawal symptoms. She saw through their attempt to give her Buprenorphine, which would make her symptoms disappear and prevent other drugs from getting her high, and demanded they give her more oxycodone. In return, she would stay and listen. \n[[File:PPx-.png|thumb|xpx|Amelia at the intervention staged by her co-workers.]]\nThe other doctors agreed on not supporting her addiction by giving her the drugs, but Addison and Sheldon went and got some pills anyway. High and finally able to listen to their pledges, Amelia actually seemed to agree to go to rehab until Ryan arrived at the practice. Seeing he wore the watch that once belonged to Amelia's dead father, Addison confronted her about how stealing it and giving it away would make Amelia's mother feel. When Amelia didn't properly answer, Addison attempted to tell the story of how her father had died in front of everyone so they could understand what was going on. Immediately, Amelia had an aggressive breakdown, even threatening to kill Addison if she ever told that story to anyone. She and Ryan then quickly left. In their hotel room, both decided to take the last drugs they had and after that, to get sober together. The next morning, Amelia woke up to find Ryan not breathing beside her. He had died of an overdose. This experience destroyed Amelia. After the cops arrived, she told them to call Addison Forbes Montgomery and tell her that Amelia was ready for rehab.<ref>[[Who We Are]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAmelia had a fianc\ue, Ryan, with whom she did drugs when she relapsed after her best friend died by suicide. One night, they decided to take the rest of their drugs and get sober the next day. Amelia woke up the next morning to discover Ryan dead. She later found out she was pregnant (she thought she was just experiencing withdrawal symptoms). It turned out the baby was anencephalic (had no brain). She decided to donate the baby's organs. There was a lot of debate within the practice about it, though the organ donation ultimately occurred, saving the lives of several other infants.<ref>[[Gone, Baby, Gone]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAfter donating her baby's organs, Amelia continued to go to meetings. Soon after she was one year sober, she met the new ER attending [[James Peterson]], who showed a romantic interest towards Amelia. After some struggles, they began a relationship. At Sam and Naomi's second wedding, James promised her that they would get married one day.\n\n\nSomewhere near the end of March , James proposed to her. She accepted, but the engagement made her freak out. She traveled to Seattle to tell Derek what happened. She realized that the engagement meant that she was likely to face a different kind of life, the kind that he and Meredith have. So she came over and visit to see what her life would be if she accepted the engagement. Happy to have found a temporary solution to his and Meredith's problem of combining their careers and family he left her to spend an entire day with the kids. She played with them, cooked dinner, and put them to bed, but when Meredith and Derek came home, they found a completely wrecked Amelia in a messy house. Amelia broke down and told them she couldn't do this. She confessed she didn't just come to Seattle to observe their life; she came here to see if she could do it. She wanted the whole kids, family, and career thing with James, but she realized that she just wouldn't be able to do it as she was already wrecked after one day. Having received an enormous blow to her self-esteem, she ran off crying.<ref>[[Change of Heart]], x</ref> \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Amelia holding her nephew.]]\nShe decided to stay with her brother in Seattle for a while. They worked together on a case to separate conjoined twins who shared brain matter. Even though he unintentionally treated her like an incompetent surgeon, she (well aware that she was in his shadow) proved him wrong by saving the twin who was assigned to her care after the actual separation. At the end of the day, Derek told her that Callie Torres needed an exceptional neurosurgeon for her project, as he was busy with the Presidential project now, and that he recommended her. Amelia objected that she didn't live in Seattle, but he suggested she should, adding he liked having her with him.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia had several phone conversations with her fianc\ue while continuously postponing her return to Los Angeles, resulting in fights with James. She settled in and started bonding with Meredith. They had a surgery planned together, and during the preparation, Amelia ignored several incoming calls. Meredith told her that just because she and Derek were juggling their lives, they didn't need to keep Amelia from her work for that. Amelia snapped at her that she liked her better as the sister-in-law who didn't give a crap about her life and asked if they could go back to that. In surgery, Meredith, thinking she and Derek made Amelia feel obligated to stay with them, told Amelia she could go back home when Derek would come from DC that night. Amelia thought she was kicking her out, but it was not that, as Meredith and Derek loved having her in Seattle, but they didn't want to keep her from her life. Amelia was extremely relieved, as she loved Seattle as well. She compared it to her life in Los Angeles, where she would've had a six-hour conversation if she'd snapped at someone like she did at Meredith. She then revealed that her fights with James weren't about her leaving for Seattle; they were about her not wanting to ever leave again. After the surgery, she confided in Meredith that James is amazing and that he helped her through some stuff, but now she's on the other side and she - realizing it sounds horrible - doesn't need him anymore. She said that at the end of the night, after having no more way of avoiding it, she would call James and break his heart by telling him she couldn't do this anymore, knowing he deserves better.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\nNow that Amelia decided to stay in Seattle, Derek was ready to let her take over his service so he and Meredith could move to DC for his brain-mapping project. Amelia started taking over his service on a couple of days in the week, even though he occasionally would hover over her. After a day with a lot of trauma and not losing even one patient, Amelia told Meredith that she felt so, so good about the whole situation. She didn't care anymore that she was in Derek's shadow, although the only thing that could ever make her feel better was if his shadow were gone. She said it would be okay if he and Meredith were to move to DC and became happy there. However, Meredith decided to stay in Seattle, leaving Derek to choose between staying with his family in Seattle or pursuing his professional dreams.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter he decided to move to D.C., Amelia took over Derek's job as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Now permanently staying with her brother and sister-in-law, she witnessed their hour-long fight. She soon found her way to the AA meetings in Seattle, where she heard how Richard confessed that he had a daughter. She promised to keep his secret safe, as it was anonymous for a reason.<ref>[[I Must Have Lost It on the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia, being one of the few people to know about Richard's relation to Maggie, befriended her later when they worked together on a case of a young girl who suffered a stroke during sexual activity. Amelia especially loved the fact that Maggie referred to Derek as the other Dr. Shepherd, whereas it usually is the other way around. Amelia became kind of jealous of her patient, as it had been a long time since she'd had really great sex, or any sex at all, a feeling that Maggie recognized. This bonded them even more, causing Maggie to open up about her problems with Meredith. Amelia assured her that while it's hard to get to know Meredith at first, she genuinely is worth knowing.<ref>[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]], x</ref>\n\nHaving decided to stay in Seattle for his family, Derek couldn't help but interfere in Amelia's cases. She called him out on that and made it clear that she was now the Head of Neurosurgery. However, this didn't stop him from taking the lead on a case of hers, as he claimed it got too big for her and that he was the rightful leader of the department, having more experience on a higher level than she has. He operated on her patient behind her back, infuriating her upon finding out. She later had a talk with her brother, revealing that he was frustrated that Meredith indirectly made him feel obligated to stay. He'd never taken a step back in his career, which is why he tried to reclaim the leadership of the department. Amelia told him she recognized the feeling, as it was what he was doing to her. He assured her he hadn't done it intentionally. He was just trying to live with his choice, which Amelia pointed out she was doing too.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n\nFinding out that Maggie was going to quit, Amelia tried to stop her from doing so by getting Derek on a case with Maggie, urging them to talk. Maggie didn't bring up that Richard and Ellis are her biological parents, and Amelia didn't want to tell Derek herself as she found out in AA and promised Richard not to tell anyone. She did encourage Derek to talk to Meredith, but since they were fighting, Derek went to ask Maggie why Amelia wanted him to talk to his wife so badly. Maggie then revealed her secret.<ref>[[Only Mama Knows]], x</ref>\n\nFinally having found her footing, Amelia was thrown off when a woman she knew from Narcotics Anonymous spilled her addiction secrets at the hospital. Derek failed to support her and even gave Owen the idea to take her job. With everyone at the hospital gossiping about her, Amelia firmly stood by her right not to tell anyone more about her problems. While Derek convinced the board that Amelia was doing her job very well, Amelia found comfort with her sister-in-law Meredith. After going to a meeting, Amelia came home, telling Derek she'd move out the next day as she couldn't forgive him for not having her back from the beginning. He revealed he felt miserable and that he didn't know what to do with life anymore, always trying to do right by the people around him, but instead hurting them. She very well knew the feeling, that she named rock bottom.<ref>[[Could We Start Again, Please?]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and [[Nicole Herman]] became acquainted when they discovered they both knew Addison. They talked about Addison and her son Henry.<ref>[[Bend & Break]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Owen's relationship remained professional up until they experienced an emotional connection after Amelia confided in him about her past drug addiction. He, in return, gave a vague description about his past and told her that everyone's a risk and that everyone has something. Later, he asked her if she had people. She assured him that she did, and then asked him the same, telling him that if he ever needed someone, she was around.<ref>[[Risk]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, when Jackson and April were facing the loss of their son, Amelia sat in the chapel thinking about her own baby that she had lost. Owen entered the chapel and sat next to her. Looking at the lit candles in the front of the room, Amelia told Owen that her baby lived for  minutes. Owen took her hand, and the two shared a glance, before going back to watching the candles.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n\nAfter this emotional and very personal encounter, Amelia did not know how to act around Owen, perhaps realizing her attraction to him. The two shared awkward dialogue filled with fluster and stuttering. While she was in surgery, Amelia told Callie that when she used to be on drugs, she had \"such game.\" Now that she was off drugs, she had no game at all. Later, Amelia decided to go to Owen's trailer. She showed up with a bottle of sparkling water and quickly realized the awkwardness of her decision. She turned to leave and started walking away. Owen ran to her and told her to stop walking. When he reached her, he told her that he was gonna kiss her now, so she should stop talking. The two shared their first kiss.<ref>[[The Great Pretender]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Owen's mother, Evelyn, came to the hospital with her much younger boyfriend, Amelia bonded with his mother and told Owen that she liked her, calling her smart and funny, though Owen was upset by the situation. Amelia tried to get him to talk to her, but Owen told her to stay the hell out of it. She walked away. Later, as she was leaving the hospital, Owen ran up to her and apologized. He told her that he was sorry for the way he spoke to her, saying that he was out of line. Amelia responded with \"good,\" and turned to leave. Owen told her not to go, not like this, and said that the situation took him by surprise and that he was not always good with surprises. Amelia told him that she was not either and that maybe they should get over that. The two retreated to Owen's trailer and slept together.<ref>[[With or Without You]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia confessed to Derek that she thought she was falling in love with Owen and that she was afraid it would destroy her. Derek responded that it would not be love if it didn't.<ref>[[When I Grow Up]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Callie had difficulty agreeing on a surgical procedure for a patient. Owen came into the room when he heard them arguing, and each pitched her idea to him. He eventually sided with Amelia, and they used Amelia's idea on the patient. The surgery had a negative outcome and had a detrimental effect on the patient, and Amelia told Callie that they should have done it Callie's way in the beginning. Seeing that she was upset, Owen asked Amelia what the problem was. She accused him of only siding with her because of his personal feelings for her. Owen denied it, but she told him that this was why it isn't smart to mix personal and professional, saying that they were a mistake. Owen walked off. Later, Owen tried to get Amelia to tell him what was really going on because he wanted what they had started, but he needed a little help to do so. Amelia wanted to go somewhere to talk, but a phone call for her interfered.<ref>[[Crazy Love]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Amelia and Owen were caught in an elevator together. Owen told her that they both know that their relationship was more, but she told him that she didn't have any more to give. Owen said that he was done, and exited the elevator. Amelia stared after him. Amelia and Owen continued having inharmonious interactions, even getting into a heated argument in front of Edwards. Following this, Amelia told Owen that she was there, ready to talk, but he was pissed at her, so she was getting punished, referring to Owen's half-hearted and monosyllabic responses. She told him that this was unfair and pushed him into an on-call room. She told him that he was hardly being civil, and he sat on the bed and explained that the case they were working on together was bringing up guilty feelings about the plane crash that he caused, saying that he put them on the plane. Amelia sat next to him and took his hand. Owen told her that he wouldn't survive another plane crash, and that was all they were. Amelia let go of his hand and left the room.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia was one of the last people to speak to Derek before his fatal accident. She was in the OR as they were talking about his secret shortcut to the airport, but the connection got lost. Unknown to Amelia, that would be the last time she'd ever talk to her brother, as he later died at [[Dillard Medical Center]] after his car got hit by a truck.<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia was one of the last people to find out about Derek's death as hospital protocol dictated that she couldn't be informed during surgery. Callie, who heard before entering the OR, had to keep a straight face throughout the entire surgery. As soon as she was done, Owen asked to talk. She immediately recognized the face, having seen it before, and asked who died. He informed her it was Derek and started to tell the details, but she shut him up, not wanting to hear any more as dead was dead. She hardened herself and said she knew how to handle this, having gone through this before. The funeral passed and Amelia was left alone when Meredith left with her kids without saying where to, and Owen left for an army mission. Throughout the following weeks, Amelia made her colleagues uncomfortable with dark jokes about her brother's death. To distract herself from her true feelings, she buried herself in her work. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia yells at Richard.]] Months later, when Richard asked to have coffee together, she burst out, yelling that her time was crucial in order to save people so that her patients' families wouldn't need to lose their loved ones. She also yelled that she was saving lives, contrary to the doctors that failed to save her brother. At that exact time, Owen returned from his army mission. The confrontation embarrassed Amelia and led her to buy oxy from a junkie doctor. Pacing up and down the deck of the dream house, Amelia was doubting whether to take drugs again after , days of sobriety as Owen came to visit her. She said that she had it all managed, Derek's death and that she was fine, explaining she put on the mask of the funny girl to escape the pain. Owen managed to get through to her and said it was normal and human to let the pain and the grief in, to be completely destroyed. He also pointed out that she'd manage to build herself up again after this. Also, if she were going to take this bag of oxy, he knew it wouldn't be her last. Knowing this was true, she gave him the oxy and she broke down as she finally allowed herself to feel the pain she had been running away from for almost a year. Owen tightly hugged her as she cried.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia confronts Meredith.]]\n\nEventually, Meredith returned from San Diego with her new baby daughter, [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]]. Amelia helped her take care of the kids, but she resented Meredith for not having called her to the hospital before the plug was pulled on her brother. On top of that, Meredith decided to put out feelers for the house with a real estate agent without notifying Amelia. These feelings of anger and resentment came to the surface when Meredith wanted to give up on their patient during a field rotation. Amelia directly asked Meredith when she personally decided to give up on someone. Meredith apologized for the house situation and for leaving after Derek's death. Amelia says Meredith should have called her, as she might have been able to pull off a miracle to save Derek's life. Meredith again stated that it was too late back then. Amelia repeated Meredith should have called her, and she blurted out that Meredith was the reason that she didn't get to say goodbye to her brother. After having said this, Amelia left, after which Meredith broke down crying.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|An emotional Amelia after hearing Derek's voice mail message.]] \nThis made Meredith realize she hadn't been a good sister to Amelia and as a peace offering, she gave Amelia her old phone, which contained a voice mail message from Derek from the day he died. Later, at Richard and Catherine's wedding party, Owen found Amelia sitting in Meredith's bedroom by herself with the phone in her hands. Amelia informed him about the message and that she couldn't get herself to hit play. Owen sat down and hit play for her. He then wanted to give her privacy to hear Derek's words, but she grabbed his hand to make him stay. While hearing Derek talk about his plans for his family and the ferry boat, Amelia got emotional. The message made her forgive Meredith and Amelia sat down with her and Maggie on the deck. Seeing everyone happy and dancing in the living room, Meredith told them that it was Derek's wish to fill the house with noise and people, so she wanted this to be her last memory of the house. Meredith noticed the two women were in need of dancing it out, so she took their hands and dragged them inside to do so.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlthough Amelia and Owen did not have an established romantic relationship, they continued with an amicable one. On the porch of Meredith's house, which Amelia shared with her and Maggie, she was telling Owen that she did not want to go inside, referring to the tension between her and Meredith. She continued to talk, and Owen kissed her mid-sentence.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nFollowing the kiss, Amelia was confused about the nature of her relationship with Owen, telling Maggie and Meredith that she thought they were just friends. Amelia and Owen continued throughout the day with awkward encounters, only speaking directly on one occasion. Later, they were again caught in an elevator together. Owen stopped the elevator and asked her why she wouldn't talk to him, and she told him that she was confused. Owen said they should talk about it, and Amelia agreed. The two shared a passionate kiss.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia tried to get Owen to open up to her about his problems with Riggs, but he told her that he was not like her and didn't need to talk everything to death. He said to listen to the words he was saying and that he didn't want her help, not with this. He stormed away angrily. Later, Amelia went to a bar, and Riggs bought her a drink, leading up to her relapse.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nAfter getting sober and earning her -day chip, Amelia and Owen went back to having an amicable, platonic relationship. After learning that Amelia had been sleeping at the hospital since being kicked out of Meredith's home, he told her that she could always stay with him. Amelia said it wouldn't be a good idea for her sobriety, but that she was going to need dinner. They agreed to get dinner that night. Later, when they were supposed to leave, Owen, who was upset due to another confrontation with Riggs asked her if they could do it another night. She said okay, but that she didn't know how to do this thing he did where he made her feel like crap even though there were no words coming out of his mouth. She said that he'd call her, maybe or maybe not, and maybe she would not care. She turned to leave and started walking, but Owen stopped her by telling her that he had a sister. Owen gave her a vague reason of why he had such an issue with Riggs. Amelia gave him some advice, and then they went to get dinner.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter spending a night with Owen, Amelia told him the next day that it was wrong of her to come over, saying that she should not be starting anything new. She continued to tell him that she screwed everything up and that she didn't want him to be one of those things. Later, in an on-call room, Owen told her they are not starting anything new. He said that if they wanted to start a clean slate, they could do that, but they should do it. They agreed to start over.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia knocked on the door of Owen's trailer, as they were supposed to be eating dinner together because his birthday was approaching. Owen opened the door, very obviously drunk because of another confrontation with Riggs. Owen was stumbling around and muttering, and Amelia said that she was going to go, knowing that because of all the alcohol that is around, being around Owen at the moment could compromise her sobriety. She ran from the trailer, crying.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Amelia didn't see Owen until later, having taken the day off work. That night, he approached her on the front porch of Meredith's house and apologized, telling her that it wouldn't happen again. She told him that she appreciated his words, but that she couldn't count on them, saying that she could only count on herself and so she couldn't do that with him right now, and maybe not ever. She asked him to leave.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Owen continued with a professional, but friendly relationship. In the attendings' lounge, Owen confessed to Amelia that it was his fault that his sister boarded the helicopter that she disappeared on. Amelia hugged him, telling him that he didn't mean to.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith, Maggie, and the kids walked in on Amelia and Owen naked on the couch. In the car, Meredith and Maggie teased her, but Amelia told them she and Owen could not be in a relationship. At the end of the day, as the three were leaving the hospital, Meredith told Amelia that she had happiness, but she kept throwing it away. She told her to stop the drama and get on with it already. Amelia turned around and started running. She took a cab to Owen's trailer, and told him that they were not the kind of people who say \"I love you.\" She said that a relationship with him would be messy and scary, but it was harder to love someone than to walk away from them. Owen told her that if they were to be together, he would end up screwing all of it up. Amelia said that she would, too. Owen took her hand and said, \"let's screw some things up,\" and then kissed her.<ref>[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]], x</ref>\n\n\nNot long after deciding to be a couple for real, Amelia and Owen began to have hypothetical discussions about weddings, kids, and a life together. After Owen bought a house of his own and implied that Amelia was welcome to move in with him, she ended up proposing to him, wanting to move from merely talking about their future to actually building their life together. He said yes.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia walks down the aisle.]]\nNow engaged, the couple quickly began to plan their wedding. Two weeks later, on the day of her wedding, Amelia phoned her mother only to find out that neither she nor any of her sisters were going to attend the ceremony, believing it to be just another rushed decision and even doubting Amelia's sobriety. Her family's betrayal left Amelia devastated and she began to doubt whether she was doing the right thing after all. Her doubts were only amplified upon overhearing Meredith discussing Cristina with Owen, and before long, Amelia was escaping her own wedding with Meredith and Maggie. After taking her time to freak out and sort her thoughts, however, Amelia decided to go back to Owen, who had patiently been waiting for her and ended up walking down the aisle after all.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> After the ceremony, she and Owen danced all night at their reception.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tries to fix Owen and Nathan's friendship.]]\nSoon after the wedding, she moved into Owen's house. The wedding photographer asked them to choose their favorite pictures and seeing Owen and Nathan happy at the wedding, she secretly invited Nathan for dinner. While working with Jo, she was confronted with how Jo's life had fallen apart and invited her as well. That night, Maggie and Meredith also showed up as Owen had urged them to come so he wouldn't have to talk to Nathan. During the party, she noticed that despite some effort, things would remain awkward between Owen and Nathan and she decided to give. After all the guests had gone home, Amelia sat down with Owen and showed him a picture of him and Nathan. She explained she's a fixer and urged him to attempt to fix things with Nathan so they could again be as close and happy as they once were.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Amelia enjoyed married life and the sex that comes with it, Maggie and Meredith began to fight as the latter refused to listen to Maggie talking about Nathan. Maggie confided to Amelia that it seemed to annoy Meredith, so Amelia went to tell Meredith that she should listen to Maggie as a good sister would.<ref>[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tries to get to know Owen better.]]\nUpon discovering that Owen goes to church, Amelia realized that there was so much they didn't know about each other as they rushed into marriage. In the process, she jokingly said she couldn't have kids with someone she barely knew. She found it scary not to know everything as some things might scare the other one. He questioned how bad it could be, leading her to walk away. That night, she opened up to him about [[Ryan Kerrigan|Ryan's]] death. He then told her about his choking Cristina and assured her their kids would be just fine. She told him she couldn't wait to have kids, to which he replied they didn't need to wait.<ref>[[Falling Slowly]], x</ref>\n\nTwo months after the wedding, Amelia was late and immediately thought she was pregnant. She confided in Meredith as she caught Amelia looking for a pregnancy test in the supply closet. As she went to talk to Owen, she was interrupted by Jackson, who handed Harriet to Owen. Amelia then decided to talk to him later. Maggie and April found out before Amelia actually took the test, which she hesitated to do as she didn't know how to tell Owen. She told April that last time she was pregnant, she didn't have to tell the father as he had died. Amelia then took the test home and told Owen that she might be pregnant. She then actually took the test. While waiting for the result, Owen already started to talk about a nursery. However, the test was negative. Owen told Amelia that they had just started and that they could keep trying.<ref>[[Both Sides Now]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Amelia was secretly relieved. She snuck out in the morning and worked all day while Owen attempted to talk to her. She finally told him that she was fine with not being pregnant. She figured they could enjoy being newlyweds before adding pressure by trying to have kids. He agreed if that's what she wanted. After losing a young boy, an emotional Amelia confided in Alex and told him about her baby boy, including the fact that nobody in her family knew the whole story. She admitted she was afraid Owen would hate her if he found out because he wanted a family so bad. Alex doubted that and advised her to tell Owen. Owen later asked her to grab dinner together, but she declined to avoid him.<ref>[[Roar]], x</ref>\n\nTo avoid talking to Owen, she took case after case and didn't come home for two weeks. This led to a lot of friction between the two. The arguing continued over a case until Amelia finally admitted that she didn't want to have a baby. After the ensuing fight, she went to Meredith's and asked for a place to sleep. Alex first told her no so she would have to fix her crap, but then offered her his room upon hearing that she had finally told Owen.<ref>[[Why Try to Change Me Now]], x</ref> They continued to live apart for a while. Amelia briefly returned home when she decided to leave Owen. She left him a note asking him not to make this his fault, knowing that that is what he does.<ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\nFiguring that Owen would look for her at Meredith's, she went to stay with Stephanie and ignored Owen's calls as she took a few days leave. While Stephanie asked her to at least let her tell Owen something, Amelia said no because then Owen would want to fix the situation while it couldn't be fixed. Behind Amelia's back, Stephanie did tell Owen that she was safe and sober.<ref>[[Jukebox Hero]], x</ref> Owen showed up at Stephanie's and asked Amelia to open the door because it would only get harder to open the door the longer she stayed inside. Since Amelia didn't respond, Owen asked Stephanie to let her know that he was done waiting.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref> Amelia then moved back to Meredith's house, where Alex offered her his bed. She spent a lot of her time off sleeping.<ref>[[Back Where You Belong]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie requested Amelia return to work briefly to clip her patient's aneurysm. Longing to operate again, Amelia agreed if Maggie made sure Owen wouldn't see her. After the surgery, she made her way out through the ER and decided to step in when Owen's incoming patient needed neuro. While getting the patient into surgery, she admitted to Owen why she was there and that she had planned to avoid him. After surgery, Owen asked her if she wanted to be married to him. She assured him she did, but she was not ready to have the inevitable fight. While Owen decided to let it slide, Amelia told Maggie she knew they had to talk soon.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n\nAs soon as she fully returned to work, Owen tried to talk again. As she didn't respond, he told her to figure out what she wanted. When he approached her after a successful surgery, she lashed out and told him she felt bullied and suffocated by him and his wants and needs, even going as far as throwing Cristina in his face. They continued in the stairwell, where she asked him why he wanted a baby so bad. He wanted a family, but she said the two of them were also a family. He found it normal to have children, but she disagreed. Having children might be wonderful, but it might also be terrible and you cannot know what you'll be given. He told her she'd be an amazing mother. She reminded him she already was a mother, for better and for worse. Her own experience with motherhood in mind, she wanted to know if he had also thought about the fact that having a child could be painful instead of wonderful. He didn't reply and she made it clear that life doesn't play by normal rules, and neither does a marriage that lasts.<ref>[[Till I Hear It From You]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia supports Maggie.]]\nThe confrontation led to the two of them giving each other space, giving Amelia time to support Maggie and her mother when the latter started her cancer treatment and stayed with the sisters.<ref>[[Be Still, My Soul]], x</ref> Amelia continued to support and comfort Maggie after her mother passed away. When Owen's pregnant friend was admitted, Amelia didn't visit her and her husband because they were Owen's friends from before she came along.<ref>[[What's Inside]], x</ref> Their love for each other lingered, as Owen briefly hugged Amelia when she was emotional after losing [[Veronica Kays|a new mother]] on the table. To take her mind off the case, Amelia went out with Meredith and Maggie.<ref>[[Don't Stop Me Now]], x</ref> After Meredith got rid of Derek's tumor drawing and gave it to Amelia, Maggie and Amelia discussed how Meredith had decided to move on from Derek and how she was clearing a path for Nathan, which they decided to support.<ref>[[Leave It Inside]], x</ref> She calmed Meredith down when she started to freak out over having invited Nathan to meet her kids.\n\n\nAt work, Amelia noticed some strange behavior from Owen. When she went to check on him, he revealed the Army came to his house to inform him that his sister Megan had been found alive in a basement in a rebel-led neighborhood. Since he doubted it was really Megan, Amelia took Owen to Meredith's house and made calls to ensure it was Megan. She ended up talking to [[Teddy Altman]], who assured her it was Megan and arranged a transfer to Grey Sloan. She also called a PTSD expert for Owen and held him while he cried over having given up on his sister. When Meredith came home, Amelia told her the news, after which Meredith took off to go tell Nathan.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> When an explosion at the hospital rendered the helipad unavailable, Amelia and Owen drove all the way up to Madigan. During the trip, Owen opened up about Megan's positive disposition and how he didn't know what to say to her now. She calmly told him he would once he'd see her. They were welcomed at Madigan by a Lieutenant and a Colonel and received instructions on how to talk to Megan. They were then taken outside in time to see the helicopter land. As Megan was unloaded, Owen held Amelia's hand.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia kept her distance from Megan and Owen while they reunited, but kept doing so once Megan was transferred to Grey Sloan. She chose to focus on a difficult case instead and never checked in with Megan or Owen. This led to Teddy confronting her about it, but Amelia lashed out in return and entirely dedicated herself to the difficult surgery.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref> She continued to do her best to get Jackson to consent to operate with her, fearing the patient might become addicted to pain meds if she were to send him home. When Owen finally came to see her himself, he brought up that nobody in his life saw her as the great person he knew her as and that their perspective made him think something was wrong with her. She again lashed out and told him to be with Teddy if that was what he wanted. She managed to remove the difficult tumor albeit by forcing Jackson to help her put the boy's jaw back together. While Jackson thought she got lucky, she credited her own skills. In a mood to celebrate, she volunteered for Carina DeLuca's orgasm study. However, that mood quickly vanished when the MRI showed a -centimeter tumor in her frontal lobe.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nShe kept her tumor a secret for a week and studied her scans with only [[Andrew DeLuca|Andrew]] in the know. She flew in [[Tom Koracick|Dr. Tom Koracick]], her former mentor, to operate on her. He studied the scans and forbade her from treating patients as her decision making was and had been impaired for years. Amelia confided in Richard and then went back over past cases of hers to decide if her decisions were indeed reckless. She started spiraling until Richard showed proof that her mortality rate was better than Derek's, thus evidencing that she hadn't hurt anyone. He also made her realize she was hurting the people she loves by not letting them be there for her. She first told Maggie and asked her to help tell Owen and Meredith, who had been telling her she was crazy for years. More than anything, she hated that Meredith turned out to be right. While Maggie told Meredith, Amelia paged Owen to the tech room to show him her scans. While initially came to yell at her for her behavior, he calmed down upon learning the news and helped her get admitted. Meredith came by and climbed into bed with her to comfort her.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia shaves off her hair in preparation for the surgery.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells her loved ones that she loves them before her surgery.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Tom examines Amelia post-op.]]\nTom planned the surgery to remove the benign grade I meningioma. While it was a fairly simple surgery, Amelia chose April as her proxy in case things went wrong since they weren't too close for emotions to cloud April's judgment. She told her loved ones she loved them tremendously and was taken to the OR. After doing the superhero pose with the surgical team, Amelia was put under.  hours post-op, Amelia woke up unable to speak, which made her think she was gorked. Throughout the first day, she was extubated but desired to sleep more than anything else. Per her own instructions, Andrew put her through her own early mobilization protocol despite Tom's objections. Richard came by in the evening to suggests pain meds, but he also knew she'd resist given her addiction to opioids, a message she was able to convey with a pained look in her eyes.\n\nThe next day, Amelia started talking but in French, a skill she was unaware of but capable of due to her having attended a French preschool. That evening, with Owen and Meredith present, she regained her ability to speak English. While she did not remember having spoken French, she did remember the tumor and the surgery. Owen wanted to call Koracick, but Amelia asked for Derek instead. Her mistake prompted them to have a head CT taken. Amelia forgot Derek died but it came back the instant they told her. She initially feared her memory loss would prevent her from operating ever again, but Tom made her realize that it was very likely temporary.\n\nOn the fourth day post-op, Tom deemed her capable of going home. Her motor and memory skills were good and her scans looked pristine. While her loved ones were relieved, Amelia herself thought they were missing something and demanded to see the scans. She studied the scans with Tom and Andrew and found they were clean. However, she ordered more tests. While she wasn't sure what she was looking for, she was sure she'd recognize it once they found it. Instead, Andrew returned to her room with her tumor in a jar. He figured that she was waiting for the other shoe to drop. He told her that for the first time in years, she was finally safe and that she probably misinterpreted that as feeling like something's wrong. She hugged him and accepted she was fine. That night, Owen came to pick her up from her room to take her home. She told him he didn't need to do that since she knew he was coming to end things with her when she told him about the tumor. He married a tumor and she didn't know who she was anymore without it. However, he said she was his wife in sickness and in health and drove her home.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nShe recovered at home with Owen, Megan, and Farouk. Megan, Farouk, and Nathan decided to move to Los Angeles so Megan could live by the beach. Owen decided to drive Megan out there with the last of her stuff and fly back afterward. When he came home, she immediately realized that he now did want to end their marriage. He told her they didn't know each other and that they weren't happy like they were supposed to. She agreed and told him it was okay. They returned their rings and hugged.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x</ref>\n\nOn her first day back, she found herself to be nervous and dropped by Owen's house to collect her notes from medical school, which comfort her. They agreed they made the right decision to split, even though their love and affection for one another remained. They decided to blame all the bad on the tumor and become close friends. While Tom officially handed her service back to her, she asked him to scrub in with her on her first patient back. When she and Tom disagreed over the approach, she paged Richard and told him that she had no idea what kind of surgeon she was without the tumor, much like how you have to figure out again who you are after you become sober. He advised her to take it one surgery at a time and assured her that the tumor did not define her. The surgery went well and she regained her confidence when she quickly stopped an unexpected bleed. Afterward, Tom admitted that she was a better surgeon than him, which led to the two of them having sex despite her disliking him.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nAfter that first patient, Amelia returned to running her own service. She walked in on Owen and Carina when she came to collect a few more things from the house. She then returned her key to him.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref> Later, Amelia and Alex were working on a case together when the hospital was cyber-attacked by hackers. With all charts down, they did not know whether their patient, who was showing signs of a stroke, had been given vitamin K already or not. That left them to gamble whether or not it was safe to administer heparin, which might cause a brain bleed if Frankie had not been given vitamin K yet. Based on his history, they suspected an ischemic stroke and administered the heparin.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> That was the wrong decision, but they caught the brain bleed in time and Amelia managed to fix it.<ref>[[---]], x</ref> Amelia later also treated [[Paul Stadler]], Jo's abusive (ex-)husband, who had a concussion and ended up braindead after hitting his head again when he launched himself at Jo to attack her and slipped.<ref>[[Personal Jesus]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia recruited [[Andrew DeLuca]] and [[Sam Bello]] to do research for five different projects Amelia had in mind for the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. When she and Alex discovered that their patient [[Kimmie Park]] had an inoperable tumor, she instructed Andrew and Sam to drop all the viability studies and look into ways they could remove Kimmie's tumor. However, it was Amelia herself who was inspired to use MRI-guided ultrasound ablation, which she then submitted as her official project for the contest with Alex as her co-author. Unfortunately, Amelia and Alex's project did not make it to round two of the contest, leaving them without a viable treatment plan for Kimmie.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Alex tried to figure out the ultrasound ablation on their own without success, as their approach only led to frying tissue. Amelia brought in Tom to help out, though they planned to keep him away from Kimmie. However, Andrew accidentally sent him to her and she and Tom actually bonded over musicals. Now understanding the rush behind the project, Tom was afraid they would not be successful in time for Kimmie. Amelia insisted they could make it work and as they argued over it, Tom thought of the option to use multiple beams from different angles. While still not perfect, the first test run seemed promising enough to warrant further exploration.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nOverhearing Maggie and her date Clive having sex at the house, Amelia realized she missed sex and came up with the idea of a game night so the sisters could judge Clive. Throughout the day, she realized her attraction to Owen's authoritative behavior in the ER. Meanwhile, Alex wanted to use marijuana oil on Kimmie and asked Amelia to convince Kimmie's reluctant grandmother. Amelia preferred not to disclose her personal history. That was the first time Tom found out about her addiction history and found himself aroused by her dark side. At the same time, Amelia urged Sam and Andrew to confess their feelings for one another as their pretending not to be in love was the only thing that made them \"bad for each other.\" Inspired by her own advice, Amelia gave in to her desire for Owen and asked if he was open to give her sex, as he was her most appealing option. He happily accepted.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref> Their new arrangement continued with Owen regularly staying over at the house. Amelia found it was the perfect way to take the edge off.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nOver time, Owen questioned if she was okay with their arrangement as he was waiting for the other shoe to drop, like the time she went back and forth about wanting kids. She told him that was the tumor and added that she never cheated despite the tumor. Owen admitted he felt like the kiss with Teddy wasn't really cheating because she told him to go to Teddy and Teddy was there for him while Amelia wasn't. Amelia then realized their marriage never stood a chance and told Owen that Teddy was his tumor. She explained he was never with Teddy, so she was like a benign tumor, but she was always there, quietly growing, so not really benign. Amelia then told Owen Teddy only rejected him because he was married at the time, but now he was single and there was nothing stopping him from telling Teddy how he felt. Throughout the Teddy, Amelia and Alex also checked up on [[Noah Brosniak]], a kid with a benign tumor causing seizures, and found him to be a perfect candidate for their project as there was no other treatment option.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|A worried Amelia waits for Noah to wake up.]]\nOwen returned from Germany after Teddy threw him out upon finding out that he came there after Amelia told him to within  hours of having had sex with her. Amelia reached out to Teddy to explain things on his behalf, but Teddy made it clear she was not interested. The same day, a nervous Alex and Amelia prepared Noah for the risky procedure. She and Andrew did the superhero pose beforehand. They used a helmet with microphones to listen for popping sounds, which would indicate Noah's brain was melting. With no place for the heat to disperse, they had to stop frequently to let the tissue cool down. They completed the procedure, after which Amelia threw up. Post-op, Amelia was overcome by guilt for putting Noah through the risky procedure when he didn't wake up for a long time, but he did eventually and showed no more seizures. However, because of the risk involved and Kimmie's case being even more difficult, the doctors decided against using the procedure on Kimmie and instead set up a treatment regimen with chemo and radiation for her. The experience made Amelia crave a drink, so Richard took her to his hospitalized's sponsor's room and they held a meeting.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n\nAlex refused to give up on Kimmie, so Amelia reached out to [[Rebecca Froy]], a doctor in Chicago doing similar research. She had a Skype interview with Rebecca and they set up to meet in Washington. However, as soon as Amelia mentioned that the Harper Avery Foundation would cover expenses, Rebecca backed out. She reached out again with Jackson to find out what the problem was, but Rebecca only said she legally wasn't allowed to talk about it and hang up again. The event set off the Harper Avery sexual harassment scandal, putting the Foundation and all of its hospitals in peril.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile the hospital dealt with employees who got high on cannabis cookies, Amelia received a call from a stressful Owen, who was assigned a foster baby boy and was not prepared to take care of a newborn. Amelia then came over to help while also taking a high Alex with her since he was playing with expensive equipment in her lab. While Owen took a shower, Amelia cleaned the house in preparation for the social worker's visit. When the social worker arrived, Amelia gave Owen a pep-talk while Alex let the social worker and baby [[Leo Hunt|Leo]] in. Alex then claimed he came to check on the kid as a pediatric surgeon. The drop-off went well and Amelia then decided to go pick up stuff at Meredith's as they couldn't be seen with Alex in public. While they gathered the stuff, Amelia once again assured Owen that what he was doing was beautiful. They took care of Alex and Leo together for the rest of the day until Jo came to pick up Alex. Amelia decided to stay for the night when Leo had difficulties sleeping.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia was there when Owen brought Leo by the hospital for his six-month check-up. They arranged for [[Betty Nelson|Betty]], Leo's birth mother, to meet them there. During the exam, Amelia noticed how Betty cringed when Arizona gave Leo a shot, so they waited together in the hallway for a bit and then went to get some food. Privately, Amelia asked how long she had been using and told her she recognized the signs of drug use, revealing her own struggles with sobriety. Betty admitted she had been using since she was prescribed opioids after surgery to repair a torn ACL and told Amelia that Leo's father was her drug dealer. Amelia then got the idea to take Betty in and help her stay sober. She talked it over with Richard, who encouraged her and said it could save Betty's life. She met up with the social worker, who thought it was unconventional but didn't see a problem. Amelia then told Owen, who offered to let the two of them stay with him as having Leo around would be an encouragement for Betty to stay sober. Amelia presented the offer, who ended up accepting. Amelia then set ground rules: no drugs, obligatory meetings, and contacting her parents to let them know she was safe. The new-found family then all went home together.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia took some time off work to help Betty get through the worst stages of withdrawal. Betty lashed out several times, but Amelia knew that that last high was a demon dying a painful death and pushing her away to stay alive and she called herself the exorcist. Later, Amelia wanted to change Betty's fluids but found that she had escaped through the bathroom window. Distraught, she attended a meeting and talked about this epidemic of doctors who write these prescriptions that ruin good kids in an attempt to help.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nA couple of days later, Betty returned to the house. Amelia came over and Betty told her that she left to get high but was unsuccessful, after which she squatted on a friend's couch. She claimed she had come back because she missed Leo. Amelia then decided to take Betty to work so she could keep an eye on her. She left Betty on a seat outside the room while she and Arizona saw [[Nicole Herman]], who had been having headaches and dizziness. Believing the tumor was back, Amelia decided to tell Nicole about her own as keeping that secret would endanger her sobriety. However, the cause of Nicole's problems turned out to be a spinal fluid leak.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia finds out that Nicole already knows about her tumor through Tom.]]\nAmelia was pulled onto April's case to watch over her as she recovered from the hypothermia but she pulled through without deficits. Amelia then went to tell Nicole that she needed a shunt. She wanted her to go to Tom Koracick for it, but Nicole wanted her to do it instead because she went to see Tom after Amelia had removed her tumor. She and Tom also slept together and she overheard a phone call of his where he talked about Amelia's tumor, so Nicole already knew about the tumor that made crazy enough to tackle hers. Amelia left the room to make an angry phone call to Tom. She then went to take Betty home with her. Betty confessed she actually did get high, but Amelia already knew. She took Betty to a meeting. <ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Amelia's feelings for one another are re-kindled as they watch Alex and Jo's wedding with Betty.]]\nA month later, on the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Amelia invited Betty's parents to celebrate her earning her  days chip, but they didn't show. Betty accompanied them to the wedding. Throughout the day, Amelia suggested that Meredith had feelings for Alex, but Meredith pointed out she was just projecting because she was starting to have feelings for Owen again now that they were playing house. Amelia helped to look for Alex when he and Jo went missing. When the wedding was called off due to several things going wrong, Amelia, Owen, Betty, and Leo joined the other guests on the ferry back to the city, where Meredith officiated an impromptu wedding for Jo and Alex.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia's new family life hit a snag when Teddy returned to Seattle without informing Owen. They ran into each other at the hospital and Teddy briefly mentioned the interim Chief position. Amelia wondered if he was still hung up on her and then went to Bailey's office to make a case for her to be appointed interim Chief, stating that she was very dedicated to her work and questioning what Teddy had that she hadn't. She later talked it over with Tom while they continued to work on their ultrasound ablation project. He told her she was not a victim in her marriage. She had been an ass to Owen to the point that Tom didn't realize they were married when they had sex after removing the tumor. Tom told her to fight for Owen as you never just get things worth having without fighting for them, citing letting his wife leave him as an example. He told her it was anti-Amelia not to fight for what you want, not anti-feminist. That night at Owen's, Amelia told Owen that she had feelings for him again and that she couldn't forgive herself if her hiding her feelings would make him chase after Teddy. Owen says Teddy accused him of being unable to be alone and that he did not want her to be right, after which he kissed Amelia.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nThey wanted to have sex, but Leo and Betty waking up prevented them from doing so. Amelia then went home and told her sisters what happened. Owen and Amelia basked in their newfound happiness while they worked a case together, while Maggie and intern Casey had just learned about Teddy's pregnancy with Owen's child. Amelia encouraged Meredith to hire [[Cece Colvin|a matchmaker]] to get to the blissful place of dating where she and Owen were. Their patient had a motorcycle accident while not wearing a helmet, which led Owen to realize that he and Amelia were reckless last time they were together, which they couldn't afford to do again now that they had to provide a stable environment for Leo and Betty. They met up after work and he stated he wanted all the strings, but she was reluctant because addicts have a certain wariness of change and commitment. However, she did promise to try and be less wary so they could be together and provide stability at home.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nThey quickly became accustomed to family life and Amelia officially declared herself off the dating market to her sisters, though she did admit that Link gave her \"pants feelings\" when they ran into him. Maggie then nudged Link in her direction in an attempt to minimize the damage that Teddy's still-secret pregnancy would cause. When Tom also flirted with her over their research, she started to wonder why everyone was so against her and Owen. Maggie later apologized for the way she behaved towards Amelia and Owen, after which Amelia comforted Maggie over Jackson's sudden departure. Afterwards, Amelia assured Owen that Maggie's thing was not about the two of them and they went to pick up the kids to go home.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia kept guarding over Betty's sobriety and confronted her when she suspected Betty had slipped, which led to an argument between the two. Amelia decided to ground her and took her to the hospital for a tox screen, unbeknownst to Betty. When she found out, she left to go spend time with Leo in daycare. While watching her, Amelia admitted she had no idea how to discipline a teenager as her mother just let her do whatever she wanted after her father died. Owen said his mother was the opposite, which led to Amelia calling her for advice. Evelyn told her that children inevitably sail away from their parents and it's the parents' job to build them a boat strong enough to safely return when they feel like it. Betty later confessed that she smoked some weed. Amelia knew that she knew there was nothing like \"just weed\" for an addict and grounded Betty for a month.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nGiven Betty's recent slip and her own history of playing hooky, Amelia wanted to make sure that Betty wouldn't ditch school to get a fix, so she and Owen hung out around Betty's school. She told Owen about the time she got alcohol poisoning at the age of  in the middle of a school day. Owen brought up apps to track kids' phones and texts, which Amelia already installed to spy on Betty, which was how she had found out about a plan to cut class today. Owen found that to be obsessive, so she had him delete the apps from her phone. After a few hours, the school VP came to check who they were and then asked them to move. Not long after, they caught Betty and two friends trying to sneak out, so Owen alerted her to their presence to make her go back. He then decided they would stick around for the rest of the day. They spent time playing with a paper fortune teller and while changing Leo, Amelia talked about how taking care of Betty and Leo made her realize that no kid could ever lessen her memories of her first son, Christopher, whose name she had never been able to say out loud out of fear of falling apart. Betty got in their car after her school day, frustrated that they had camped out there all day. That night, Amelia dropped by Meredith's house to pick up some things as she had decided to stay at Owen's a little longer than anticipated. Unbeknownst to her, Teddy had spent the entire day at Meredith's while discussing her pregnancy and plans for the future with Meredith.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy came by the house to finally tell Owen about her pregnancy, but before she could do so, Amelia returned from daycare with the news that Betty had disappeared from school. The three of them spread out in the city to look for her, including amongst unhoused teenagers in the park, and reconvened at the house with no result. They opted against calling the police because Betty wasn't a regular teenager. Amelia herself once disappeared and the police found her about to jump off her friend's roof high on pills. Owen took Amelia to a meeting while Teddy stayed behind in case Betty returned. Later that night, Betty still hadn't returned, making Amelia fear that she was dead. Owen took her in his arms and comforted her.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWith a windstorm approaching Seattle, Owen and Amelia headed into work and dropped Leo off at daycare. While Amelia was treating [[Phoebe Moss]], Amelia saw Betty walk down the hallway. She had a head lac from being hit by a tree branch, but she was otherwise fine. Amelia wanted a tox screen but Betty honestly admitted to being high. Amelia reminded Owen to tell the nurses that Betty's an addict and headed into surgery. Amelia lost her patient in surgery. While things were arranged for Phoebe to be an organ donor for [[Cece Colvin]], Amelia had to call Phoebe's mother and tell her the bad news. Afterwards, Amelia went to hug Betty and told her that she always could and should come back. \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells Owen about her plan to become Betty's official foster mother.]]\nAmelia then went looking for Owen and eventually ended up on an elevator with him, Teddy, and a trauma patient. As she told Owen that she wanted to apply to become Betty's official foster mother, she noticed some tension between the other two. She asked what was going on as the power died, trapping the four of them in an elevator.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia gives Owen time to consider his options.]]\nThe power kicked back in soon, but for some reason, the elevator remained stuck. Owen then revealed to her that Teddy was pregnant and she realized the child was his. While Teddy and Owen worked to stabilize the patient, Teddy told Owen that the two of them getting together was off the table, so he was free to be with Amelia. She just wanted to stay in Seattle so their child would have two parents and she would have her friend. They rushed out to an OR as soon as the elevator started working again. After saving the patient, Owen found Amelia and told her that Teddy's pregnancy didn't change anything, but she disagreed. She knew his history with Teddy and told him she was giving him time to consider all of his options. Later, Amelia heard from Richard that Betty had been looking for drugs in the hospital, making Amelia realize that she could no longer help Betty on her own. She booked a bed in a rehab center and made the offer to Betty, who accepted.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nWith Betty gone, Amelia dedicated all her energy towards finding a treatment plan for Catherine with Tom. She overheard Owen fighting with Teddy where he yelled that if she had been upfront right when she returned, he wouldn't be in this crap situation. Owen tried to explain his comment to Amelia, but Tom threw him out of the lab so they could focus on Catherine's case. They tried some approaches through VR glasses but none of them worked. Jo brought salvation when she informed them of a new type of visualization that they could use in surgery. Owen caught up with Amelia as she was heading out and told him that even though he was expecting a baby with Teddy, he also had a real family with Amelia and he didn't want to do anything of it without her. He told her he was choosing her, so they went home together.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nThe day finally arrived for Catherine's surgery. Amelia was nervous to operate on a surgical legend and did the superhero pose to gain confidence. Her and Tom's surgical plan had to be abandoned when they found that the tumor was too dense and too attached to the brachial plexus to remove it entirely without compromising motor function and thus Catherine's career. They opted to leave a small part behind, meaning Catherine would have to live with cancer. Catherine, however, was glad that they managed to give her her life back and accepted the outcome. That night, Amelia and Richard went to a meeting and she talked about how glad she was to be sober to experience a high like this, derived from giving Catherine her career and life back and saving her loved ones from losing her.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nWith the holidays approaching, Owen and Amelia decided to do Christmas presents at home instead of Meredith's so they could establish normalcy and traditions with Leo. Amelia visited Betty in rehab and told her that Leo was teething, but Betty told her that she didn't miss Leo as much as she did drugs, adding that she was still a kid of her own and shouldn't be a mother. The holidays passed and the visits continued. One time, Owen accompanied her and they saw Linus, a boy Betty had met there. During their talk, Betty came clean as part of the -step program and told them that her name was actually Britney and that she had run away from her parents, who don't know about Leo. She asked them not to call her parents as she feared they might take Leo away. That night at home, Owen tried to find Betty's real parents, but Amelia thought there was no point and that it was Betty's choice to make. He was angry at Betty for lying to her and didn't accept Amelia's explanation that it was part of the disease. He lashed out and said the addiction was just an excuse for piss-poor life choices. Hurt over his comment, she prepared to leave, but he apologized and said he was afraid of losing Leo. On Valentine's Day, Owen apologized for being an ass with a bouquet.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells Owen that Betty's parents have surfaced.]]\nSometime after, Amelia received a call from the rehab center that Betty had run off. As she was leaving the hospital, she was approached by Betty's real parents. Betty had called them from rehab two days ago, but when they arrived there today, they were told she had run off and they directed them to Amelia as Betty's legal guardian. Amelia explained the whole situation to them and then went to inform Owen about their arrival. Together, they took John and Carol to go see their grandson in daycare. Owen grew uneasy as they compared him to baby Betty, so he left. While John was off to find a hotel, Amelia talked with Carol. She recalled how terrified she was when Betty first ran off and said she couldn't imagine feeling that way for a year and a half. Carol said she was a good mother and talked about how the drugs ruined her little girl. She didn't understand how Britney could call her and then run off. Amelia shared her own history of drug abuse and shared how shame made her avoid her mother when she got clean. She promised Carol her little girl was still in there.\n\nHowever, Carol told John and they decided to take Leo with them that night, refusing to leave Leo with another addict. Owen said he was Leo's legal guardian, forcing them to leave without their grandson. Afterward, he yelled at Amelia for giving them information that they could use to take Leo away from him. Amelia said they weren't married, so she wasn't standing in the way of his fighting for Leo if he wanted to do that. He got mad that she used \"if\" but she pointed out that he was just Leo's foster father and that Leo's family had returned. She added he didn't even seem to care about Leo's mother being missing, but Owen said Betty was never a real mother.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, they arranged for Betty's parents to come pick up Leo. Owen and Amelia said their goodbyes and handed him over. Unable to deal with it, Owen quickly left for work. Amelia then finished packing while John and Carol fed Leo. She received a call from the hospital, which was flooded with a mass overdose, including Betty and Linus. Amelia rushed to the hospital with John and Carol and learned that Teddy would be operating on Betty's aortic dissection. Amelia took a moment to gather herself and talked with Link, who shared he goes to a blues bar in Barbados in his mind to escape to on stressful days. Their talk was interrupted when they found Linus in a closet, having died after self-medicating with unknown drugs. They were unable to save him and Amelia took it upon herself to call his parents. She broke down and Link comforted her. She then joined Owen, Carol, and John in the waiting room. Teddy eventually came by to tell Betty had made it through surgery. Amelia hugged her. Later, Amelia and Betty's parents visited her in the ICU. While John wanted to keep Linus's passing a secret, Amelia told them about Ryan and how his death was the rock bottom that pushed her to get sober. Together, they prayed that Linus's death would push Betty to decide to live. Betty woke up soon after with her parents and Owen and Amelia by her side.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nThe time came for goodbyes. Betty wasn't sure how to go back to living a normal teenage life, but Amelia told her the drugs were gone now and that she would always be there for her. Without a real goodbye, Betty left with John, Carol, and Leo. As soon as they were gone, Amelia went to get dressed for Catherine's party, unable to spend one more minute in the house.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Amelia run into Tom and Teddy at the party.]]\nShe and Owen ran into a kissing Tom and Teddy at the party. They learned that Tom was taking Teddy on a surprise trip to Palm Springs, which made Owen even grumpier, creating an even bigger contrast with Tom's chivalrous attitude towards Teddy. Amelia then vented to Meredith that she wasn't sure she and Owen were still a thing with the kids gone. While she and Owen intended to talk things out, they started bickering about how he couldn't accept addiction as a disease while he hated how she threw things from months ago in his face. She hated how he never checked up on her while she was in pain, too. She then brought up that he had been staring at Teddy the entire evening and walked away. She consulted with Meredith about Owen's feelings for Teddy. Meredith told her she'd have to make to peace with the fact that Teddy would always be in Owen's life. Amelia then realized she and Owen were in a circle that just kept going around.\n\nOwen later came to tell her that he was staring at Tom, not Teddy. He didn't want Tom around Teddy or his daughter. Amelia told him that it shouldn't matter if he didn't have feelings for Teddy. He told her was being insecure despite his choosing her over and over again, but she couldn't trust that his feelings for Teddy wouldn't flare up once the baby arrived. She couldn't see a way out of that and realized she didn't need to try. She decided to step out of the circle because, unlike Owen, she wasn't stuck in that complicated baby situation. She found she made the right decision when Owen yelled at Tom at the party, which led to Tom punching him in the face. She was evacuated with the other guests when a supposed fire broke out in the kitchen. While outside, Amelia got a text from the Dickinsons and went to Owen's house. She summoned Owen and the Dickinsons told them that they weren't ready to raise a baby, nor did Betty want to be a mother. They realized that Owen and Amelia were Leo's real parents. Betty told Amelia she needed to be a kid who could make mistakes, which she couldn't do with Leo around. This time, Betty did say goodbye to Amelia, after which she left with her parents.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nOwen and Amelia proceeded with Leo's adoption, but the procedure hit a bump when the lawyer discovered that the two of them weren't living together anymore. They hadn't discussed yet how they wanted to share custody, so the lawyer left them alone to get on the same page before she presented the case to a judge. They decided to use the -- approach, which Amelia commented probably wouldn't last after the baby arrived. This brought up Owen's frustrations with Tom and Teddy's relationship. He once again declared that he had chosen Amelia, but she said that breaking up was a moment of clarity for her, and while it hurt, it hurt less than the alternative. Owen then started blaming her, saying that he had tried to blame it on the tumor but that it turned out that she was just fundamentally incapable of love. Amelia then decided to remove herself from the adoption paperwork. She wanted to be in Leo's life as Aunty Amelia as much as Owen would let her, but Leo was and always had been his. She then left the office and went to Meredith's, where her sisters comforted her.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\n\nSoon after the definitive break-up, Amelia attended the Western States Conference for Alternative Pain Relief for the first time, which she found out about after the mass overdose day. Much to her surprise, she ran into Link there, who had attended the conference for a few years. She had avoided Link ever since she broke down in his arms on the overdose day and chose to continue to do so, but she ended up lying next to him at the sound bathing session. Feeling a bit loopy afterward, she and Link sat down in a hallway. She confided in him that she felt unfinished with Betty, which he said is how parents feel. They briefly flirted and almost kissed, but she stopped herself and went to her room, declaring herself unfit for human contact.\n\nShe ran into him in the lobby the next morning. They got coffee together and attended the same talk. She later attended his talk, which chronicled a case of a boy becoming an opioid addict after knee surgery and eventually dying because of the addiction. As soon as Link mentioned he'd prescribe opioids again, Amelia left the room. He later came by her room to explain, but she shut the door in his face. He claimed she would have done the same thing, but she disagreed as she knew how addiction works and how companies are profiting billions off it. He said he would prescribe opioids again, but not blindly this time around, as their effectiveness is unparalleled. He talked about the error of his ways and how he quit medicine after losing the patient, but he eventually returned to make things right. He suggested they take on that fight together. They then started kissing and agreed to be pain relief for one another.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nA glowing Amelia returned to Seattle and Maggie soon figured out that she had had sex with Link. While they planned to keep it a one-time thing, Amelia thought it best if they steered clear of one another as she appeared to be really attracted to his pheromones. That plan failed when they were put on [[Kari Donnelly|Kari Donnelly's]] case together. Kari's spine fractured in two places after a snowmobile accident, which left her paralyzed from the neck down. After delivering the bad news to Kari's child, Amelia and Link ended up making out in the blue light mood room.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref> Amelia and Link's sexual relationship continued for stress relief. Amelia ran into Owen and Leo on the hospital elevator, allowing her to spend time with Leo. Amelia then went to de-stress in the blue light mood room. It surprised her that seeing Owen still stressed her out because of the amazing sex she was having.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nShe and Link flew out to the Catherine Fox Foundation Medical Center in Manhattan to operate on [[Jonah Mays]]. While out of town, they agreed to bend their sex-only rule and had pizza for breakfast together. He talked about his cancer and happy childhood in New York while she said hers there was quite the opposite. In the hospital, they ran into [[Nancy Shepherd]] who insisted they come for dinner. She accepted and begged Link to come, knowing full well it wouldn't be pleasant, but it would prevent months of family gossip and it would give her a chance to prove to her sister that she wasn't a train wreck. She wanted him to pose as Owen so she wouldn't have to tell them her marriage failed, which would pose no problem as her family did not attend the wedding. She promised to make it worth his while if he came with her, so he finally agreed to do that. On the way over, she taught him details about Owen's life that she knew so they could sell it.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia and Link have dinner with her sisters.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Link stands up for Amelia when her sisters berate her for past mistakes.]]\nHowever, they were surprised to find that [[Kathleen Shepherd]] was also attending the dinner. Kathleen quickly cornered \"Owen\" with questions about Iraq, so Link fled to the bathroom and told Amelia they would fake a medical emergency. However, when Kathleen shared that she thought that Amelia just did the drugs for all the drama and that Amelia always runs at the first sight of trouble, Link decided they would stay to prove her wrong. While Amelia briefly left to help Owen out with a stuffed toy emergency for Leo, Link impressed her sisters by de-boning fish in one move. The sisters really liked Link despite their low expectations for black sheep Amelia's husband and the dinner went smoothly until [[Carolyn Shepherd]] arrived right when dessert was served. Carolyn called them out on their lie, having met Owen when she had visited Derek a few years back. Amelia was then forced to come clean and her sisters mocked her and berated her with embarrassing stories from her past, though acknowledging that fake Owen might just be the worst of them all. They also revealed that they had placed a bet on how long her real marriage would last. Amelia blurted out that that kind of behavior is why she kept her tumor from them. Link came to her defense and praised Amelia for the person that she is and the way she parented Betty and Leo. Amelia's family did not know about them, which was the last straw for Amelia, who promptly left.\n\nIn the cab back to the city, Amelia blamed Link for forcing her to stay, stating that he was just pain management and that he now knew too much about her. They went back to the hospital and Amelia pitched a radical, risky surgery when their old plan proved to be impossible. Jonah accepted the plan, but Link feared she was trying to prove her worth after the disastrous family dinner. She firmly said she wouldn't let herself be defined by them and that she was capable of performing the surgery. It went flawlessly. On their way out of the hospital, Link distanced himself from Amelia and told her he'd see her at the plane. Amelia had a brief talk with Jonah's brother, who had no clue what to do with his life now that he wouldn't need to care for him anymore. Amelia advised him to give Jonah time to figure out who he was outside of his brother's shadow. She then reached out to Nancy, who turned her down. Much to Amelia's surprise, Carolyn stopped by the hospital to talk.\n\nThey went to the park and Amelia asked her if she was truly incapable of love. Carolyn shared a story of how Amelia taught herself to ride a bike to join her siblings riding around the neighborhood. She would fall over and over, but she never gave up, nor would she let anyone help her. That made her the most like her father out of all the Shepherd children. The resemblance to her deceased husband was the reason that Carolyn distanced herself from Amelia, finding it to be hard to be around anything that reminded her of him. Derek offered to watch over her and she let him, which she came to regret. She wasn't there when Amelia needed a mother the most, to figure out life and loss and love. Having some experience as a parent, Amelia knew she wasn't an easy child to parent. Carolyn apologized for missing her tumor and the wedding and she was also sorry that things weren't better between her and her sisters. Carolyn said she was to blame if Amelia thought she wasn't capable or worthy of love. She told Amelia to put that thought behind her and move forward, which Amelia wasn't sure she would be able to do.\n\nAfter that talk, Amelia came to the airport and offered Link some doughnuts from a place he had talked about during their pizza breakfast. She told him he was kind and brave with her family and she apologized for how awfully she had treated him. He accepted her apology and they started to cram doughnuts in their mouths while laughing. After arriving back in Seattle, Amelia went to tell her sisters all about her time in New York.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n\nBack in Seattle, Link found a clinical trial that might cure Kari's quadriplegia. Kari was accepted and Amelia, Link, and Tom started to prepare for the procedure. While doing so, Tom picked up on the developing relationship between Amelia and Link and mocked her for dating Ortho Barbie. She acknowledged that fun and easy wasn't her type, but she was liking the change. When he compared that to the way he felt about Teddy, she took pity on him and told him that the baby wasn't the result of a one-night stand but a true love baby. She thought that Owen and Teddy getting together was inevitable. Tom claimed he wasn't scared by that and they went to perform the procedure on Kari.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells Tom to choose an easier option than Teddy.]]\nAfterward, Link invited Amelia for sushi burritos. Privately, Amelia told Tom that he wasn't being brave by fighting for Teddy. He thought she was just hiding behind Link to cover up that she was hung up on Owen. Amelia replied she had come to learn that sometimes, life offers you easy choices and Link was refreshing. While she admitted she may still be hung up on Owen, she was not using Link but instead just choosing an easier path. She suggested he do the same and then joined Link for the burritos.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Link also started to hang out at work. Owen saw how he handled her and found out that there was something going on between them. When she consulted on Owen's case, he asked about Link, but she told him he did not get to ask about that or have an opinion on it. Owen later found her outside Kari's room and told her that therapy made him realize that he was talking about himself when he told her she was incapable of love. It was actually the opposite of true for her. She thanked him for that and gladly accepted his offer to spend more time with Leo.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Link kept sleeping together but she forbade him from sleeping over. When they both fell asleep one day, she made sure the kids were not around before she made him sneak out. She then helped Alex to get the kids ready for the day because Meredith was spending time with a depressed Jo. At work, she and Tom kept checking on Kari as the window of a successful outcome was closing soon. That night, Amelia took Leo home because Owen hadn't returned from his mission to retrieve [[Frances Pinfield]] from the airport. Link then asked her if Owen was her past or her future because he started to feel like there was something real developing between him and her, but her playing house with Owen made him doubt that. She didn't know if they were something real, but she agreed to give him an answer soon. Later, Teddy came by the house and Amelia assured her that she was just there for Leo and that she and Owen were not back together. Teddy came there looking for Owen. She wanted to profess her love for him before their daughter was born, but that time had run out as Amelia pointed out her water just broke.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia called the hospital to have them set things up for the delivery and then arranged for a babysit for Leo. She timed Teddy's contractions and deemed that there was still time to drive Teddy to the hospital herself. However, en route, they got stuck in a traffic jam and found that the freeway was closed because of thick fog covering the city. Amelia found a police officer and convinced him to drive them to the hospital with the sirens on. Teddy appreciated her genius solutions and said they could have been friends in another life. Teddy asked her if she was still in love with Owen. Amelia admitted she still was a little bit, but also said she falls in love quickly and easily.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells Link he could be an option if he allows her some time to figure out who she is outside of Owen.]]\nAt the hospital, Amelia was called to Kari's room as she had moved her fingers, meaning the stem cell transplant had worked. Amelia later came to see Owen and Teddy spend time with their newborn daughter. Link joined her and Amelia told him that she jumped into him way too fast on the heels of Owen and the life she thought she was building with him and the kids. She thought of him as a rebound back then, but she couldn't tell if he was more than that to her now. She needed time to look at her options and told him he could be one of them if he didn't need her to decide anything too permanently right now. He agreed to give her time to figure out who she was outside of Owen.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia took Leo to visit his baby sister. Bailey came in soon to fetch her and Owen for an incoming trauma, so Amelia handed Leo over to Teddy and left. While operating on [[Mari Prishna]], Amelia commented she never could have held onto the rope as long as she did. Link made a snide remark, so she clarified that she had just meant to take things slowly with him to put an end to her habit of going all in too fast. A few weeks later, she found Owen looking for Teddy in the ER. He had offended her by offering to milk her. Amelia laughed at him and sided with Teddy. She told Owen that giving birth is a beast to a woman's body, so he would need to be patient with her.\n\nDuring her date with Link, she confessed that she wanted to try a threesome, which he supported. Together, they came up with an explanation for [[Jai Prishna|Jai Prisha's]] apparent stroke: fat embolus syndrome. They rushed over to the hospital and initiated an experimental protocol to prevent Jai from having to live his worst nightmare of being hooked to machines. The protocol worked and Jai recovered without deficits. Afterward, Amelia went to Carina to ask her for a threeway. Carina was confused as she thought Amelia had come to see her about her pregnancy, having noticed the changes in her body. Amelia thought she had just gained some weight because Link eats a lot, but then it dawned on her that she hadn't had her period and that she was, in fact, pregnant.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nWhile accompanying Maggie to retrieve stuff from Jackson's penthouse, Amelia asked her for advice on how to tell Link about the pregnancy. She dreaded telling him but Maggie made her see she had to. Amelia followed Link into a staircase at the hospital and blurted out that she was about eight weeks pregnant. She told him she didn't expect anything from him but didn't want to keep it a secret either. She brought up her bad history with pregnancy but was paged away for a trauma before she could elaborate. After handling the case, they met in the green room and she told about Christopher and how that experience terrified her of ever being pregnant again, which resulted in her being militant on birth control and her consequently hardly menstruating anymore, which explained why it took her so long to notice. She acknowledged she was in a privileged situation and could afford to provide a good life for a baby but she didn't think that was enough to bring a child into the world. She asked about his feelings and he said that while he had imagined worst-case scenarios, hearing her experience made him realize they didn't matter and that the most important thing was for her not to get hurt again. He was willing to suck up his fears and be a dad if she wanted to keep the baby and if not, he would support her in every way that he could. She abruptly left the room. At the end of the day, she told him she had been scared of raising a baby alone but his words had made her less afraid and even a little bit in love, which she attributed to the hormones. She then said they would make an amazing kid and that she would like to meet that kid. He did as well, thus agreeing to become parents.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nWith only Maggie in the know, Amelia informed her first of her decision. She almost let it slip when she ran into Teddy and Leo but managed to dodge and leave. She ran into Link and asked if he had told anyone. He admitted he had told Jo and realized she didn't like that. She thought they weren't in the place of telling people yet. Keeping the secret made Amelia feel like she was lying, which bothered her as she was committed to rigorous honesty. Maggie told her privacy and honesty were not mutually exclusive, which helped her. However, after watching [[Bertram Hollister]] and [[Soyoung Oh]] reunite after six decades, she realized that you can't let go of good things just because they scare you. She found Link and told him that their pregnancy was a good thing and that wanted to share it with her family and friends despite the fact that that scared her. Together, they went to Meredith's house and shared the news with her and Andrew. Contrary to Amelia's expectations, Meredith was over the moon about becoming an auntie and congratulated the pair.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia, together with Maggie, was among the first people to discover the article that was published in Meredith's name trashing Grey Sloan. They informed their sister, who hadn't written anything yet, and found out through them that the website had crafted an article based on her suggestions but without explanations or context. Since it aimed at Grey Sloan specifically instead of the medical system, patients started going elsewhere and two of Amelia's surgeries were crushed. She did assist Jackson in his ploy to provide a pro bono surgery for a -year-old girl without the quid pro quo publicity that Tom wanted to attach to it. She started craving a gravity-blanket or bear hug from Link, which he started to do to calm her down. However, he had had a rough day, so they reversed roles and she lied down on top of him. He then told her he was in love with her. Love had previously scared him as he associated it with divorce and pain but he didn't want to try to avoid pain when life had all sorts of ways to hurt you unexpectedly. She appreciated his feelings and they continued lying there with their hands on her belly.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Link's cancer-versary, his parents visited and wanted to have lunch with him although they hated each other. After  minutes into lunch, it turns into a competition of whose life is better after the divorce. He invited Amelia to join him for lunch, which she hesitated as she is historically bad with parents but Link convinced her to go by reminding her about the time he went to the dinner with her sisters in New York and this year is going to be different as he will be telling them about the baby. During lunch, Link's parents announced that they are getting remarried and his father would like Link to be his best man for the wedding, which brought back the bad memories for Link whereby he was placed in between his parents. Their divorce had put him through hell whereby they used him like a pawn and forced him to chose. He mentioned that he spent Christmas on an airplane in order to see them both and double-majored so they could each have their graduation ceremony. It took him years to manage lunch with parents who wanted to tear each other apart. He doesn't know what to say but he knows he will never treat his kid like that. After dropping the bomb that they are going to be grandparents, he leaves to get some air. Amelia made him realize that he was angry with them, not for the fact that his parents are getting remarried, but because this day was supposed to be about him and not them. Link noted that for someone who says she is bad with parents, she seems to know his parents pretty well, to which Amelia replies that she understands family dysfunction. She told him that they could leave if he wants or he could give them another chance to do better. At the end of the day, Amelia lit up a candle on a plate of candies and takes it to Link to wish him a happy cancer-versary. \n\nBailey was comparing pregnancies with Amelia and was shocked to find out that Amelia has not taken any ultrasound yet for her baby. Amelia knows she should have had one, but she's terrified of what she might find out. Bailey says the best way to fight fear is information. Amelia asks if she's terrible for not getting an ultrasound. Link if surprised she hasn't gotten one yet, which gives her her answer. Link asks if she doesn't want to know everything there is to know. Instead of answering, Amelia points to Andrew and is upset because he dumped her sister, and Link put him on his service. Amelia eventually decided to get the ultrasound by the end of the day. Carina does Amelia's ultrasound and tells her everything is perfectly fine however she's not  weeks. She's  weeks. Amelia says that's not possible because that could mean the baby might not be Link's. Link and Amelia were paged to the ER as the residents were injured at the bar. Link asks Amelia about the ultrasound. She tells him the baby is healthy. When all the patients were treated, Amelia finds Link and says she has to tell him something. It deserves privacy but she has to spit it out. Before she can tell him, Owen and Teddy walk in and loudly announce that they are getting married. They congratulate the couple. Afterward, Link asks Amelia what she wanted to tell him. She tells him it's a boy. Link wants the name Scout in the mix.\n\nLink finds Amelia by the coffee cart and notices she's upset about something. She then sits him down and tells him, with difficulty, that he might not be the father. He knows the other option is Owen. Amelia wanted to tell him first because she wants to be with him and a paternity test won't change that. She tells him to take some time to think. Link and Jo talk about the situation with Amelia. He says it doesn't change anything. He's trying to look on the bright side. Amelia doesn't want a paternity test anyway. Jo's shocked that he's okay with that and calls him on it. She says he can love her and be mad at her at the same time. Both things can be true. At night, Link paged Amelia to the plant room. He told Amelia that there are tests and he should have known from the beginning if there was a question of who the father was. Amelia admits that she's chaotic and doesn't always think things through and sometimes that hurts people. She apologizes for hurting him. He says there are a bunch of people involved in this who deserve to know. Amelia asks what will happen if they find out he's not the father. He says he wants to be the guy who says that it doesn't matter, but he doesn't know yet and they should gather information and take it one step at a time.\n\nAmelia has been avoiding Link since he asked for the test, however, Jo called her out for it to ask her to stop avoid Link as Link has feelings and he's allowed to be upset about what Amelia did. Link enters the plant room, where Amelia is waiting. He asks if the results are back. She says they'll be back tonight and asks him what's going to happen. He says he doesn't know. She asks him if he could try to know what will happen to them if they find out it's Owen's. Amelia asks if he wants to be with her, to be in the baby's life. He says she and Owen have a complicated history and he's worried the future will be shaped by that history. He loves Amelia, but he needs to know. At night, Link is in the plant room. Amelia watches him through the window then walks away. He then gets a text telling him she didn't get the test and that she needs more time.\n\nAmelia discusses with Maggie about her pregnancy and relationship with Link whereby she mentioned that she's further along than she thought, which means the baby might be Owen's. She and Link are really good together. It was perfect and now it's not, because Link is not sure if he wants to be with her if the baby's not his, which makes Amelia unsure if she wants to be with him if the baby is his. She wants Link to love her enough for the baby's biology not to matter. Maggie understands Link. She would be terrified that Owen being the biological father could reignite whatever embers still linger between Owen and Amelia. It wouldn't have anything to do with not loving her enough. Amelia asks Maggie to be on her side for a minute. Maggie imagines the hormones would be overwhelming and she would want to be held and loved no matter what and assured that she's not going to be alone. She then does just that as Amelia breaks down in her arms.\n\nLink is at Meredith's house speaking with Maggie, who says she has heard from Amelia and assures him she's doing okay. He wonders why she doesn't want to talk to him and tell him what the test said. Maggie says Amelia doesn't know the results. Amelia comes down the stairs and says she's not going to pick up the test results. Maggie apologizes for lying. Amelia wants to raise the baby with someone who will love him and her no matter what a blood test says. As it turns out, that's her sisters. She then ended their relationship by telling Link to go home as they are over.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working on [[Brad Spencer]] together, Jo advises him not to blow things with Amelia as Amelia gave him a choice, which is more than Jo got from Alex. Link paces outside Meredith's house. Amelia sees him and opens the door. He tells her he was going to write her a song, but he can't do that as fast as he needed to come there and tell her he doesn't want to live without her. She reminds him of what he said and he says he loves her and wants her. He doesn't care if the baby is his or not. He doesn't want to feel sad or lonely anymore. He's in love and that's what matters to him. Amelia asks him if he really wants to do this, even if the baby isn't his. he says he does. She kisses him and says she needed to hear that because she got the results and he is Link's.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia tells Link they can make it work if he wants to take his dream job. He says there are new things in his life that he loves more than that job. She thinks it's scary that from now on, every want and need and desire is gonna be put on hold for their kid. She makes him promise they will always fight for their dreams.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia started having contractions in the middle of [[Guthrie Hamilton]]'s surgery. Link was paged to her room and Amelia starts to panic about what could happen to their baby. Link doesn't know how to make her feel better so he screams with Amelia on her next contraction. Later, an OB fellow examines Amelia and says her contractions are Braxton-Hicks. They both have a moment of laughter because they thought it was actually happening.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nWhile consulting on [[Richard Webber|Richard Webber's]] case, Amelia's water broke. Link arrived after her initial pelvic exam by Carina. When Amelia was  centimeters dilated, Link was called away by Bailey to perform the explantation and hip replacement surgery on Richard to reverse the effects of cobalt toxicity. Amelia requested Bailey to stay for her labor since she'd sent Link away. After the surgery, Link came into the room and asked Amelia if it was another false alarm. She said she was okay and Bailey called him over to meet his son. He walked over to Bailey and she handed him the baby. He then walked over to the bed and sat on the bed next to Amelia. She said he was beautiful and Link said they both were.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia has spunk and is always very outspoken and charismatic. She is that \"badass\" type of girl who doesn't let anything or anyone get in her way. She also has a knack for saying the wrong things at the wrong time in uncomfortable or awkward situations. She seems to have slight trust issues also, because of her troubled past and has trouble letting others into her life. After overcoming her drug problems, she appears to have matured. Her dark backstory changed her, although she remains straight-shooting, sarcastic, and funny. She sometimes appears to be tough and closed off, but she's occasionally warm and overbearingly compassionate. Callie describes her as \"volatile,\" and she has earned the nickname \"Hurricane Amelia.\"\n\nAccording to her mother, she's the most like her father of all their children in that when she fails, she comes out stronger.\n\n\n\nThroughout her time in Los Angeles, Amelia had several romantic flings, but none very serious except for Ryan.\n\n[[Ryan Kerrigan]]\nAmelia got serious with Ryan, whom she met at a club and subsequently slept with. Amelia and Ryan became very close with their common drug addiction, going on a drug binge for twelve days where they slept together and did drugs. He proposed and she accepted, where she gave him her father's watch, which she had stolen from her mother as an engagement present. After a failed intervention with the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]], Amelia returned to her hotel room with Ryan where they made the pact to \"get clean\" after consuming the last bit of the drugs they had; Amelia passed out and woke to find Ryan dead next to her due to an overdose where he had choked on his own vomit in his sleep. Before his body was taken away, she retrieved the watch from his wrist. After the ordeal, Amelia checked herself into a rehab facility. Once fully recovered, she discovered she was pregnant with Ryan's baby.\n\nShe discovered it quite late because she assumed the symptoms were withdrawal symptoms. When Addison gave Amelia her first ultrasound, she discovered her baby boy was anencephalic, meaning he would be born without a brain. During the pregnancy, Amelia decided to donate her baby's organs to save other babies all over the country. After some difficulties with [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose Hospital's]] lawyers and an ethical disagreement with Sam, the baby's organs were donated.\n\n[[James Peterson]]\nJames and Amelia worked together at St. Ambrose. James kept asking her out, but she rejected him. When they finally went out, he didn't kiss her at the end of the date. He did that twice, which is why Amelia decided to go on a date with someone else. When she was getting ready to go to the date, James showed up at her house and said he couldn't stand the anticipation, and they finally kissed, starting off their relationship. At Naomi and Sam's wedding, he told her they were going to be the ones to get married someday. In March , he proposed to her. She accepted, but the fact that she was facing a new kind of life made her freak out and flee to Seattle, to find out if she could live a life like her brother [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and his wife [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]]. Soon after, she decided to move to Seattle and ended her relationship with James.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMark was Derek's childhood friend and often spent time at the Shepherd household, so Amelia grew up with Mark around. Years later, they had a brief sexual relationship during her first visit to Seattle after the mass shooting. Amelia was shocked when she heard of Mark's death in the aftermath of the [[Flight|plane crash]].\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nAfter some time in Seattle, Amelia began to bond with Owen, as they could relate to each other's rough pasts and offer support to one another and quickly found herself developing feelings for him. Having stayed out of the dating game for so long, she wasn't exactly sure how to approach him, but after some awkward encounters with him, she decided to act on her feelings and went to visit him with a bottle of water, which resulted in a kiss. After helping [[Ruby (I Feel the Earth Move)|Ruby]] save her mom, they hugged. Then they were seen making out in an on-call room and he carried her to a bed. After many interruptions, while trying to consummate their affections, they finally slept together after Owen apologized for lashing out at her while his mother was in the hospital.\n\nAmelia confessed to Derek that she was falling in love with Owen, and was afraid it was going to destroy her. When a surgery went wrong, Amelia accused Owen of only supporting her inferior approach because he had feelings for her. She said she gave up everything from her past life to start fresh in Seattle and that they shouldn't have started dating, as it affected their professional careers. Owen then tried to understand where that was coming from, but after fighting, Owen ended things in an on-call room, calling their relationship a \"plane crash.\"\n\nLater, when Amelia was living with Meredith and Maggie, she was left at the hospital by Meredith and Owen gave her a ride home. When they got there, he attempted to ask her to go to a concert with him and she kissed him.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref> The two continued to grow very close, to the point where Amelia decided to propose to Owen, telling him that despite the fact that marriage may be too soon, she was sure that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> They got married soon after getting engaged in front of their friends and family.\n\nOwen and Amelia's wedding bliss didn't last for long as they realized they had a difference in opinion about starting a family. Amelia felt that Owen was pressuring her to start a family, which she wasn't ready for. Their marital problems got so bad that Amelia didn't come home for weeks and avoided Owen at the hospital. After months of their marriage being on the rocks, Owen had enough and went to ask for a divorce from Amelia. Just as he was about to do so, he discovered that she had a brain tumor, which likely affected her judgment about their hasty marriage. Once the tumor was removed, Owen and Amelia amicably decided to get a divorce, as they didn't know which part of their relationship was not affected by her tumor, which had been growing for approximately ten years.\n\nAfter getting divorced, Owen spent some time away from Amelia and decided to foster a baby named Leo. However, he soon realized he was in over his head and sought help from Amelia, who later moved in to help him and also mentored Leo's birth mother, Betty. Owen and Amelia bonded over their new family. Eventually, Amelia told Owen she still had feelings for him, and they got back together. Their relationship seemed to be back on track until Teddy returned to Seattle and revealed that she was pregnant with Owen's baby. Amelia gave Owen time to consider his options, and he chose Amelia. However, after Betty and Leo went back with Betty's parents, Owen and Amelia started fighting again, leading to another breakup.\n\n[[Atticus Lincoln]]\nWhile looking for the quickest route to the ER, Link met Maggie, who suggested that Amelia might be good for him. He asked Amelia to have dinner with him, but Amelia was confused and quickly declined the offer to go out with him.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Betty was in surgery, Amelia broke down sobbing and Link consoled her.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref> Soon after, Amelia attended a medical conference where she ran into Link, who was giving a lecture. They flirted with each other and Amelia even decided to check out his presentation. After hearing that he prescribed opioids to a patient who became addicted and died and would do the same thing again, Amelia got upset and left. Link continued the lecture, but visited Amelia's room afterward and told her his patient needed opioids, but where he went wrong was not telling him and his mother how addictive opioids could be and not carefully monitoring him to make sure he didn't become addicted. He said he wanted to change the system to a relieved Amelia. Amelia made a move on Link and they ended up hooking up in her hotel room.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> When Nancy Shepherd reunited with Amelia she pretended that Link was Owen.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref> Link and Amelia continued their relationship until Link realized Amelia saw it only as fling when she hid him from her sisters. He called her out for it and told her he wanted something more. After taking some time to think about it, Amelia said she needed to discover herself outside of Owen, but that there might be a place for Link in her future.\n\nAmelia discovered she was pregnant and believed it was Link's until she found out she was further along than she thought. Link asked her to get a paternity test, and she asked if he would still be with her if the baby wasn't his. He said he didn't know, and she texted him later on, saying she never got the test.\n\nShe avoided him for a whole day after she told him she didn't get the test, and he showed up at her door. Amelia told him that she wanted her baby to be raised by someone who loved both the baby and her, regardless of blood. She then broke up with him.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nThey got back together when Link came to her house, not wanting to lose her, and said he didn't care if the baby wasn't his. Amelia kisses him and tells him she took the test. He's the father.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia began feeling contractions in the middle of a surgery and told Taryn to get Tom. Link rushed to her room and they both panicked over what their future would be like with a child. An OB came in and let them know that it was Braxton-Hicks, not labor, which relieved Amelia and Link.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia's water broke in the middle of discussing Richard's case. She walked herself to her room, and Link hurried over later. Carina confirmed that it was labor this time, not Braxton-Hicks. Link was called away into surgery, so Amelia asked Bailey to stay with her. After Link got out of surgery, he came back to see Amelia sitting up and not in pain. He initially panicked, thinking that something was wrong, but Bailey showed him their son. Link sat in bed with Amelia as they marveled at their new child.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the COVID- Pandemic, Link and Amelia struggled with their lifestyle. While Link loved the domestic life and wanted to marry Amelia and raise more kids with her, Amelia felt confined and barely hanging on. Despite their disagreements, Link proposed to Amelia at Maggie and Winston's wedding. She told him no, knowing that she couldn't give him the lifestyle he desired without losing herself in the way. This led to several arguments and even a second proposal, which she also declined, leading to a break-up.\n\nAfter Thanksgiving, which they spent together in Meredith's absence, they slept together. While for Link, this seemed to rekindle things and give him hope on their future, Amelia made it explicitly clear that it didn't change anything for her, referring to the status of their relationship.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Link changed his mind regarding marriage, and concluded that he didn't need marriage to be happy. He only needed Amelia and Scout. He decided to profess his love to her as soon as possible, so planned to go to Minnesota, where Amelia was supposed to be, until he learned she was actually in Seattle, preparing for David Hamilton's surgery. When Link got back to Grey-Sloan, he went to find Amelia and was shocked to see her kissing Dr. Kai Bartley.\n\nBecause of Owen Hunt's injuries, despite Link's anger, Link and Amelia had to operate together. In the middle of the surgery, Kai appeared in the gallery. When Link noticed then, he ordered everyone to clear the gallery. Amelia figured out it was because he saw her kissing Dr. Bartley.\n\nAfter the surgery, Amelia confronted Link over his behavior, and called out his attempts to gaslight her. Later, while talking to Kai at the bar, Amelia mentioned that Link sent her a picture of Scout, since that day he was taking care of their son. She also told Kai she felt bad for how things turned out with Link, saying she hated that he made her break his heart and then made her do it all over again.\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nAmelia had a crush on Carina DeLuca and also masturbated for her study because of this.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia later asked her to be part of a threesome with her and Link. Carina is insistent that the sexual cravings during pregnancy are making her feel this way. Amelia says she isn't pregnant and that she's just been eating a lot, but, she then realizes that Carina is right.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n[[Kai Bartley]]\nKai and Amelia began flirting with each other shortly after their first meeting.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\nFinally, one night, they each attempted to be the last person out of the lab. Kai said they were typically the last one to leave, but agreed to leave first so Amelia could win some points with Hamilton. Before they left, Kai asked about Amelia's family, whom Tom had mentioned. Amelia told Kai about her son and his dad, but then said she was single. Kai said they were also single.<ref>[[Bottle Up and Explode!]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a major breakthrough in their research, they asked Amelia to go get dinner, but Amelia had to catch a flight back to Seattle.<ref>[[Today Was a Fairytale]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Kai and David came to Seattle for David's surgery, Kai and Amelia kissed outside the hospital after Amelia used guided meditation to help Kai calm down.<ref>[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Owen's surgery, Kai met Amelia at Joe's, where Amelia explained that her life was messy.<ref>[[No Time to Die]], x</ref>\n\nOnce Hamilton's surgery was successfully completed, Kai and Amelia worked together to finish their report. They finished and then Kai invited Amelia to their band's performance. After the performance, Amelia went home with Kai and they had sex. The next morning, Kai told Amelia she didn't have to leave, but Amelia insisted that she did because she was a mom who missed her son.<ref>[[The Makings of You]], x</ref>\n\nAt Meredith's party, Kai ended things between them after meeting Scout, because they never wanted children and didn't want to lead Amelia on any longer.<ref>[[Stronger Than Hate]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the breakup, they texted that they missed Amelia. Later, they came to the hospital and told Amelia they couldn't sleep and the two of them kissed.<ref>[[You Are the Blood]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nShe and her only brother Derek share a special bond because they were together when they witnessed their father getting shot. Derek resuscitated her once after she overdosed in her youth, and her addiction issues troubled their relationship ever since.\n\nThey had their last conversation over the phone as she was operating. He was T-boned by a truck and taken to the small, suburban [[Dillard Medical Center]], which was already swamped with patients from the car crash that Derek had helped with. Meredith was called and decided to pull the plug, something Amelia was among the last people to find out about. This upset her since it robbed her of a chance to say goodbye.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith Grey is her brother, Derek Shepherd's, widow. Despite having three other sisters, she is closer to Meredith, her sister-in-law, than any of her sisters. They currently live together at Meredith's house along with her nieces and nephew; and her son, Scout.\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nShe is very close to her former sister-in-law, Addison, and says that she has always been a better sister to her than her three real sisters. Addison did her hair for prom and she was the one to teach Amelia about birth control since Amelia didn't know who to ask. Amelia was the first one to find out about Addison's affair with Mark but decided to keep it secret because of how close she was to Addison. Amelia even offered to be a surrogate for Addison after she had gotten sober but Addison refused, wanting to protect her.\n\nThey were very close throughout the years Amelia spent at the practice and they consistently comforted each other. Amelia lived in Addison's house when she moved in with Sam next door. \n\nAddison grew concerned about Amelia when she suspected her of doing drugs again, and Amelia moved into a hotel. She returned to the practice after being missing for twelve days and Addison slapped her for scaring her but later hugged her as she was relieved she was okay. Addison and the others held an intervention at the practice where Amelia was cruel, insulting Addison where she knew she was sensitive. Addison gave Amelia oxy in order to get her to listen to them, and prevent her having withdrawal symptoms despite the majority of the others holding the intervention disagreeing. Addison threated to call Amelia's family and fire her if she didn't at least try to cooperate with them, stating that, \"I love you Amelia, but I will not love you to death.\" When Ryan was revealed to be wearing Amelia's father's watch, Addison confronted her about it, asking how it would make her mother feel. Addison began to tell the story of how Amelia's father died, provoking Amelia to have an aggressive breakdown and needing to be restrained by Ryan. She threatened to kill Addison if she ever retold that story and left shortly after.<ref name=\":\" />\n\nWhen Ryan died and was taken away by police, she asked if they could call Addison and tell her she was ready to go to rehab. Addison later took her to a rehabilitation centre<ref>[[The Breaking Point]], x (PP)</ref> and helped her through her grief and trauma.\n\nAmelia shut out Addison when Addison informed her that her baby had no brain. She was jealous when Addison officially adopted Henry as Addison had everything she wanted but couldn't have, so she yelled at Addison to stay away from her and told her she hated her. Addison respected this until Amelia went into labour where she couldn't stay away when Amelia was in so much pain (especially since refusing pain-relieving drugs due to her addiction), so she barged into Amelia's room to support her. Amelia accepted Addison's support and let her hold her as she was in labour, declaring she was calling her baby a 'unicorn baby'.<ref name=\":\" />\n\nAddison later admitted she had refused Amelia as a surrogate because she didn't think she was good enough, but that Amelia had proved her wrong and she asked Amelia to be Henry's godmother since she saw how good Amelia was with him. Amelia happily accepted.<ref>[[Mourning Sickness]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nThey pair reunited when Addison came to Seattle to treat a patient and confided in each other about how their lives in lockdown affected them. Amelia told Addison the real reason she broke things up with Link, and Addison told her about her dark times during lockdown.<ref>[[Hotter Than Hell]] x</ref><ref>[[With a Little Help From My Friends]] x</ref>\n\n[[Sheldon Wallace]]\nSheldon helped Amelia give up drugs. After Amelia's rehabilitation, Sheldon had a hard time forgiving her for the mistakes she made when she was using. After a short time, they reconciled. Amelia mentioned to him that he had to live a long life so that she could make everything he did for her up to him.\n\n[[Charlotte King]]\nAmelia and Charlotte were close friends. After Charlotte was raped, they bonded over their similar drug history. They went to AA meetings together and looked out for each other. Charlotte was very protective of Amelia when she knew of her newly developed cravings for alcohol. When Amelia slipped and drank before being paged to operate on a patient, Charlotte took her privilege to operate and fired her. After she hurt her hand in a bar, Sheldon took her to the hospital so that she could fix it. At the same time, Pete suffered a heart attack and Amelia was paged to help Sam in the OR to save Pete's life. Still technically not allowed to operate, Amelia still went and helped. Charlotte checked on her but let her do her thing anyway.\n\nAfter the surgery, Charlotte talked to Amelia again about her addiction. Amelia argued she had never been an alcoholic and her problem was pills. Charlotte disagreed and told her she was still suspended until she got help because she refused to support her addiction any longer.\n\nTo prove that she was able to operate again, Amelia showed Charlotte her one month chip from AA. Charlotte still didn't give her her job back. After talking to Sheldon though, Charlotte gave in and let Amelia take a breathalyzer test to see if she wasn't lying. She was sober. They made a deal that Amelia could operate again, but would have to take a breath test every morning for a while.\n\nAfter Amelia's friend Michelle died, she turned to drugs again. Charlotte eventually noticed her changed behavior and confronted her about her drug use. Amelia quit the practice as a consequence.\n\nWhen Amelia broke into the practice to get her prescription pad, the police wanted to arrest her. Charlotte arrived and identified Amelia to protect her. As Amelia wanted to leave, Charlotte knew she had her prescription pad to get more drugs. She begged Amelia to accept her help but Amelia stormed off.\n\nCharlotte then initiated the intervention in the hopes of saving Amelia. Amelia said some hurtful things during this time but after she got out of rehab  days later, Charlotte welcomed her back nevertheless. Their friendship survived Amelia's relapse.\n\nWhen Amelia found out about her brainless baby, Charlotte tried to talk to her several times but was shut down. When she wanted to donate the baby's organs, Charlotte did everything she could to make that happen despite her own opinion on the donation.\n\nWhen Charlotte was pregnant, Amelia helped her through that time very often. While Charlotte was in labor and therefore in a lot of pain, Amelia walked with her and helped her by soothing the pain with a special grip that Jake had helped her with once.\n\n\nAmelia graduated at the top of her class at [[Harvard Medical School]], completed her [[General Surgery|surgical residency]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]], and followed up with a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship]]. She has published enough research to \"single-handedly wipe out several forests.\"\n\nShe is [[Board Certification|board certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Neurological Surgery|neurosurgery]] and was employed as one of [[Geraldine Ginsberg|Dr. Geraldine Ginsberg's]] [[Teaching Fellow|teaching fellows]] until Ginsberg fired her for discussing with a patient's husband a surgery that Ginsberg did not recommend and considered highly experimental, which was successful.\n\nShe is a world-class neurosurgeon like Derek and although talking to her brother about her situation could help her find a new position she does not want to call him because of the \"lectures and the \"I told you so\"s and the \"You screwed up again\"s that she fears will follow. Amelia takes risks in surgeries and at times appears very confident in her own abilities but when problems arise she can become overwhelmed with self-doubt. Sam had to push her to finish her surgery on Addison's comatose patient after complications arose.\n\nAfter she was fired by Dr. Ginsberg, Amelia worked as a neurosurgeon at the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. After this practice was dissolved, Amelia continued working at [[Seaside Health and Wellness]], the successor of the Oceanside Wellness Group. While working at both practices, Amelia held hospital privileges at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]].\n\nA few years later, she went to Seattle to visit [[Derek Shepherd|her brother]] and [[Meredith Grey|sister-in-law]] as well as their kids. While she was there, she was given privileges at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and eventually started taking over her brother's practice. Since he planned to move to D.C., she took over his job and became the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]].\n\n\n*Amelia is an atheist. \n*She drives a BMW  Series.\n*Amelia is a democrat.\n*She has a freckle that looks like Indiana.\n*She claims to be \"freakishly\" good at stitching.\n*Although she mentioned Derek is the only one who can call her Amy, Meredith has called her Amy on occasion and has her in her phone address book under the name Amy as well. Her sisters have also called her Amy.\n*Amelia was contacted when Derek needed a nerve after the plane crash, but she didn't answer the call and presumably never replied to the message [[Heather Brooks|Heather]] left her.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref> It can be presumed she didn't want to go through uncomfortable and possibly painful medical procedures so shortly after getting sober as it might have amped up her craving for pills. Another reason could be that the plane crash happened at the same time she gave birth to a child that died after birth.\n*[[BokHee]] is her favorite scrub nurse.<ref>[[The Distance]], x</ref>\n*Because Amelia completed a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] prior to a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship]], she is also [[Board Certification|board-certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|general surgery]], but because neurosurgery is considered a sub-specialty of general surgery, Amelia is not \"double-board certified\", as board certification in general surgery is required to obtain board certification in neurosurgery.\n*Amelia was so high at her uncle Adam's funeral she dropped her end of the casket. Her sister [[Kathleen Shepherd|Kathleen]] mistook her for being drunk.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n*She said to Owen that she lost all the men she loved, referring to [[Mr. Shepherd|her father]], [[Derek Shepherd|her brother]], [[Christopher Shepherd|her son]], and [[Ryan Kerrigan|her fianc\ue]].<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n*She doesn't wear panties.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n*Addison took Amelia to get her ears pierced, did her hair for prom and among other things she explained all about birth control when Amelia didn't know who to ask.<ref>[[Who We Are]]]], x</ref> \n*Amelia's mother told her, several years later, that the reason that she had to look out for Amelia is because from all her kids, she is the most like her father and it was hard to be around her because of that. Amelia's mother told her that is her biggest regret.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]]], x</ref>   \n*Amelia knew she wanted to be a surgeon since she was .\n*Amelia has referred to herself, Meredith, and Maggie as \"Lady Chief Trifecta,\" \"The House of Lady Chiefs,\" and \"Sister Lady Chiefs\".<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n*Amelia has a fireworks-themed personalized scrub cap.\n*Classical music puts Amelia to sleep.\n*Amelia is right-handed.<ref>[[God Laughs]], x (PP)</ref>\n*She speaks German.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> She also speaks French on a subconscious level because of the French preschool she attended.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*Her mortality rate is .%, which is better than her brother Derek.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n*She likes to put the thermostat to \"boiling\".<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*She finds her old medical school notes comforting.\n*Amelia needs to floss before sleeping, or else she can't sleep.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n*Amelia had ligyrophobia.

And I took it, and all of a sudden I felt okay. Better than okay. I felt good, and so I kept taking them and I felt.. great. And when people would try to stop me and tell me it wasn't real, I would just laugh. Because it was real. How I felt, it was better. It was better than being miserable. But it almost killed me. I was dead for three minutes, and let me tell you, when you are lying on a stretcher, gasping for what you think are your last breaths, you don't think that dying happy is better than living sad. Dying sucks. It hurts. In a way that I can't describe to you. And no, I don't believe that people can change. I don't believe that you'll change, but maybe I'm wrong. And hell, maybe you will wake up from the surgery and you will be happy. But if you're dead.. if you're rotting in the ground from some tumor that ate your brain, you don't get a chance to find that out. One more thing, and then I'll go. I'm not a religious person. I don't believe in God. But if I did, I wouldn't believe in a God that wanted you to die the horrible, painful death that you will experience from a giant tumor that will take away your ability to speak, and see, and go to the bathroom, and breathe on your own.

Why do we even try when the barriers are so high and the odds are so low? Why don't we just pack it in and go home? It would be so, so much easier. It's because in the end, there's no glory in easy.

I'm asking you to help dismantle my baby for parts. And there's no piece of anyone's soul that can hold that and feel okay. But I'm asking. I'm asking you. I'm his mother. And I'm asking you to do this. And you want to know why? It's because I did a little research, Sam. Science. In Chicago, there's this baby girl,  weeks old, with pulmonary hypertension who needs new lungs. Outside Detroit there is a -day-old boy who was born blind, but could see if he had new corneas. I read this blog about this -month-old kid named Gideon in San Diego who's been on a heart-lung machine for months because he needs one tiny valve in his heart. There's burned babies who need skin. There's infants who need livers, and toddlers who need kidneys, and there's even this one -month-old girl named Lulu who needs a multiple-organ transplant. My baby could save all of those babies. He could be responsible for kids leaving the hospital and going home and growing up and falling in love and having sex and arguing with their boyfriends and making mistakes and living and maybe not ruining their lives with drugs. What I'm asking you to do is unimaginable. But it's also everything those other mothers could ever imagine. I'm his mom. And I'm asking you to do this. If I can get there, why can't you?<ref>[[Gone, Baby, Gone]], x (PP)</ref>\n----\n:'''Amelia:''' I do not have time for coffee, I do not have time for meetings. My job is not to make you feel better about me. My job is to make my patients get better. Do you know what can happen in the hour or two I would be wasting with you? An hour or to matters. They matter to me. They should matter to you. They matter to my patients. If I leave and my patient dies, it's not me who will suffer. It is his mother, his sisters, his friends, his wife. And they will hate me. With everything inside them they will hate me and you and everyone here because they won't understand why he's gone, why people always leave, why everyone you give a crap about walks away or is ripped from your world without warning, without reason in convenience stores and plane crashes and podunk hospitals with podunk doctors, who don't do what they're supposed to do which is save people.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n----\n:'''Amelia:''' A thing I've learned, is that life is a series of choices.

He had end-stage renal disease and had spent  months on dialysis waiting for a donor. The wait was long because he needed a six-antigen match. During his pre-op exam, they discovered a large bump on the top of his head. They hoped it was minor and wouldn't affect the transplant, but it turned out to be osteosarcoma. The tumor had good margins, but removing it would leave a large gap in his skull and skin and that would disqualify him for a transplant. Jo then had the idea to use the kidney donor as a skull and scalp donor. They did the skull and scalp transplant first and then the kidney transplant. Both transplants went well and Simon was awake and had visitors afterward.\n\n\n\nHe was married until his wife died.\n\n\nHe and his wife had six kids that he raised on his own after she died. Those kids had seven grandkids. They all visited him in the hospital after his transplant.\n\n\n*His late wife gave him his hat. He caught  prize-winning blue gills wearing it.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jaffee, Simon}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}]}}}}
