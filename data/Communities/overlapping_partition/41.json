She is married to [[Carina DeLuca|Carina DeLuca-Bishop]].\n\n\n\nMaya grew up with an abusive father, who pushed her to train excessively to ensure her winning every race, going as far as forcing her out of bed the morning after a race by pouring cold water over her rather than letting her enjoy her victory. He also put her on a strict diet that wouldn't even allow her to eat a cookie. As such, Maya missed out on the things that most teenagers occupy themselves with, like music and celebrity crushes.\n\nDuring practice, one of her competitors, [[Hima]], approached her and invited her to tag along with the rest of the team for pizza. Maya declined because of her diet. Hima had noticed him at races before and commented he was a bit scary. Maya admitted he was. Hima then invited her to the theatre to watch the latest movie, which Maya accepted. As their friendship grew, Maya developed a crush on her. While Hima was helping her with her trigonometry, she discovered that Maya wouldn't even eat a cookie per her father's imposed diet. Maya knew how it looked but she praised herself lucky for having a dad who put her above everything else, never missing a single race, while other dads were always working or vanished after a divorce. Hima then found out Maya didn't know anything about pop culture. When she asked if Maya had a celebrity crush, Maya replied she had a crush, though not a celebrity one. She then leaned in and kissed Hima.\n\nDuring the next race, Hima twisted her ankle and fell on the track. Maya, who was leading the race, stopped to check on her. Hima urged her to keep going but Maya only managed to get back to second place. Her father was furious with her and told her she had no friends on the track, only competition. That night at the dinner table, he punished her by denying her potatoes. He then went on to ignore Maya completely and turned to Mason, who wasn't used to receiving attention from his father. Mason said he finished third in a mile run and got a piece in the school art show. Their father told him to quit art so he could achieve first place. Maya stood up for him by saying she would come to his art show and reached for the potatoes, but her father grabbed them and threw the bowl into the wall and he told Mason he couldn't hear losers, who are dead to him. His behavior made her put all her attention back into training. She won the next race and as her father congratulated her, she ignored Hima's attempt at high fiving her.<ref>[[Into the Woods]], x (S)</ref>\n[[File:xMayaMedal.png|thumb|Maya's gold medal.]]\nMaya then went on to win a gold medal in the , meter sprint in the  Olympics in London. She did so on a sprained ankle, pushing through the pain like she had been taught.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref><ref>[[House Where Nobody Lives]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nOn her first day at the fire academy, Maya met Andy. Andy tried to tell her they didn't have to be friends because they were the only two women. Maya said there's safety in numbers and they ended up sticking together. When Andy struggled with a hose drill, Maya coached her through it.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy was confused about her feelings, she called Maya and Vic to drink and hang out. They talked on the porch and admitted Ryan's looks when he came over to talk to Andy.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya went with Travis on a medical call. They tended to [[Edith]], who had fallen and dislocated her shoulder, something that had happened before. Maya was shocked that Edith refused pain medication. Travis saw her foot shaking and asked if she had seen a doctor for it, but she said she was fine. Travis told her she needed an adjustable bed and her grandson was supposed to get her one. She said that she hadn't told her grandson about it because she didn't want him to worry.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile on duty, Maya received a call from [[Ryan Tanner|Ryan]], explaining that her brother was in jail for stealing art supplies. When she arrived at the jail, she was surprised to find out that he was unhoused. She explained to Ryan how he took an interest in art but his parents had no attention or investment to give him since it was all put into her Olympic training, and that Maya blamed herself for his drug addiction. Ryan said to her that he would keep Mason at the jail overnight and keep an extra eye on Mason while on patrol, which Maya agreed to.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy responded to a call for an Aid Car at a police stakeout, just in case anyone got hurt. They got bored as they waited in the ambulance, unable to leave. After the lost the video feed and heart gunshots, Andy, worried for Ryan, wanted to go in immediately, but Maya reminded her that they had to wait to be called. Not long after, they were called in and they learned that it was another officer, not Ryan, who had been shot and they took him to the hospital for an x-ray because the bullet had been caught by his vest.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital. At the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she was scared of fire. They decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref> Maya and Travis did fire drills with Vic, exposing her to flames. Maya continued the drills, even when Vic started to panic. Maya tried to coach her through it, but Vic said it wasn't helping and stopped the drills. They later went jogging, which Vic also didn't enjoy, but Maya said it was jogging or the torches.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy took an ambulance out to give hepatitis vaccines to unhoused people. They saw Mason, who declined a vaccine and Maya's help. Despite this, Maya returned to the area to bring Mason supplies, both things she thought he needed and things he thought he needed. When she jogged by the area later, she saw that he'd painted a mural on the wall, but had left the area.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Maya noticed Vic just starting at the flames and stood with her when she said it helped.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station . Maya sang Andy's praises in her interview, including regarding her decision to leave Jack in the Aid Car with Peter. Maya also admitted, when pushed, that Jack overcame Andy's rule breaking to gain a good outcome. She then told Ripley she knew that Jack was a strong candidate. He then told her she was also a good captain candidate and he expected her to throw her hat in the ring to be lieutenant if a spot came up.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. With the fire in the house, the garage started to heat up. They searched for anything they could use to try to free themselves. They found a toolkit, which Karen used to pick the lock on the trunk of the car and retrieve a jack. They tried to use the jack to lift the garage door, but it wouldn't budge. As the temperature climbed, Ryan decided to hot wire the car and try to use it as a battering ram. Jack said it was a bad idea, but Ryan started it anyway. Andy was able to stop him before he moved the car. Jack had the idea to use the motor from the internal door to get access to the house. It didn't work and they started to wear out. When Pruitt arrived and gave Andy a pep talk, she used the last of her energy to think of a plan. She saw the water heater and decided they could use the pilot light to create an explosion. They siphoned gas from the car and rigged the water heater up to explode and propel itself through the garage door. It worked and once they were free, they were all cooled down and rehydrated.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the law firm, Maya and Vic worked with [[Molly]], the fire coordinator for the floor who took her job very seriously. They had her watch the stairwell while they checked the floor. When the evacuation was started, they had to keep the civilians calm as they waited for their turns. They sent the first group down with Molly, but when the fire jumped floors through the windows, the civilians panicked and started running down the stairs, which led to them trampling Molly. Maya, who had intermittent hearing loss from the water heater explosion, didn't hear Vic warn her. Maya and Vic then continued to fight the fire and Vic found that she wasn't afraid anymore.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Vic started to evacuate themselves, but they met up with Andy, who was on her way up to find Jack. Maya decided to stay with Andy so she wouldn't be alone and sent Vic down to find more help. She and Andy then went up to the floor where Jack was. The door was jammed, which Maya worried meant that the other side of the door was so hot it would kill them instantly. Despite this fear, she helped Andy open the door. Once the door was open, they heard Jack's PASS device going off. They followed the noise to a pile of rubble, which was burying Jack. They were able to free Jack and then evacuated the building.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety. Back at the station, Maya was upset with Andy for ruining their first chance to get Max.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Maya was paired with Jack to teach one group, which included [[Elle Kingsley]]. They both flirted with her and spent the whole day trying to outdo each other for her affection. When Sullivan saw them laughing and felt they weren't taking it seriously, he called Maya out on it, which eventually got him sent home for the rest of the shift. At the end of the day, both Jack and Maya got Elle's number. Upon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party on the station's roof with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAt the recommendation of Ripley and Sullivan, Maya applied to be a lieutenant. She didn't tell the rest of the team, but they found out when Ripley commented on it in front of them. She later told Andy she hadn't told them because she worried about awakening the competitive beast inside her.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya was on the Aid Car with Andy. Their first call involved a kid. It should have been a simple call, but the kid ran into a building with a gas leak, so they had to track down the kid and break through a wall. They came back to the station very dirty. After a shower, they tended to [[Greg Tanner]], who came in looking for Pruitt to patch him up after a fight. Andy tended to him instead and called Ryan, who didn't believe Greg when Greg told him he got in the middle of a fight defending a kid and his phone got broken. When she was finished treating Greg, they got called out again, to tend to an injured hiker. With difficulty, they found [[Clark]], who had fallen and had a branch puncturing his leg. After returning from a later call, she and Maya found Greg in an elevator, where he'd passed out. They suspected a cardiac bruise from the fight. They were able to restore sinus rhythm.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died. Four months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy, Dean, and Maya responded to a call about a woman injured in the park. They arrived to see a confused woman on a park bench with a head wound. She couldn't remember anything about herself or how she was injured. While checking her for other injuries, Maya found a picture of a boy in her shoe. They finished checking her out and then dropped her off at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Later, they found her at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] when they were dropping off another patient. Andy went after her and got her to agree to come back to their rig. Maya and Dean went to investigate how she'd ended up there. Dean learned she was a fugitive and the cops wanted them to distract her to give them time to arrive. They learned she was [[Margaret Chen]]. Andy felt there was more going on, so she asked Margaret about it. She stole some money from her work to pay for her son's medical care. She was going to put it all back, but she got caught before she could. He was scheduled for his surgery that day and she wanted to see him before her surgery. They enlisted Ryan's help. They were able to sneak her into the hospital to see her son and then she was arrested and taken to court.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Jack were called out to the transit tunnel for an unknown medical emergency. They arrived to learn that a subway had malfunctioned and multiple passengers were injured in a minor fall. Once they boarded the car, they started treating the injuries, which all seemed minor. One of the injured was [[Will (Crazy Train)|Will]], who didn't want to let Maya check him out, but agreed when Maya asked directly. She examined him and asked about his cough, but his father didn't know how long he'd had it. Will coughed up blood and Maya noticed that he'd been on an international flight. He'd come from Bashran, in the middle east. Maya consulted with Jack and said she believed they were dealing with a contagious illness and needed to go on lockdown. They radioed out for CDC, which confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in Bashran and said they'd be on their way. They also noted that another passenger, [[Neil]], had come in on the same flight. They talked to Will's father and explained the situation and then made an announcement to the whole car. While they were working, Maya told Jack that she believed he had lied about being fine to get back to work. The situation escalated when Neil's condition worsened and he collapsed on the floor. They put in an IV and used lidocaine to restore sinus rhythm. He stabilized, but then Will collapsed. While Maya and Jack were distracted, [[Reese]] tried to leave, but [[Kenneth]], a security guard, used a taser on him, which set off a cardiac episode. He took the heart monitor off Neil and put it on Reese, which revealed ventricular arrhythmia. They didn't have anymore lidocaine to treat him, so Maya went through the Aid Car, asking the passengers to show her any medications they had. While she was working on that, Reese flatlined and Neil stopped breathing. Jack asked the passengers to help and handed out assignments. They were able to stabilize Reese, but realized Will needed blood. Desperate, Jack used Harold as a donor for his own son. After a rough moment, all the patients were stable. The CDC then arrived and set up decontamination so all the passengers could leave. Jack and Maya's tests showed that they weren't infected. After being decontaminated, the two of them went back to Maya's place and had sex in her shower.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. Once she was freed, they stopped her seizures and sent her to the hospital. When a broken cell phone and an extra propane tank caused an explosion, Maya took over caring for an infant that had been surrendered at the station so Sullivan could oversee stabilizing the building. She used him as a sounding board for her romantic and friendship troubles before handing him over to the social worker.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya has an innate competitive nature that results in her wanting to be the best at the station. According to [[Dean Miller|Miller,]] she doesn't do relationships and usually only has exclusive relationships for a few weeks. However, Maya is also described as relentless and caring, and if she cares about someone she cares fully and will do anything for her friends and family.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n[[Charlotte Dearborn]]\nShe had a one-night stand with [[Charlotte Dearborn]] as part of her self-care.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Elle Kingsley]]\nWhile teaching CPR and first aid, Maya flirted with Elle, a police officer. At the end of the day, Maya got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Jack Gibson]]\nMaya and Jack first met on Maya and Andy's first day at Station . Jack\uajokingly asked if he could touch Maya's Olympic Gold Medal for luck, but Maya immediately refused, telling him it wasn't luck but hard work and it proved how much better she was than him. Then, Maya and Andy both agreed that Jack was \"very ew\".<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> Maya was the only person who knew about Jack and Andy's secret relationship, the latter's proposal, and their subsequent breakup. She was often antagonistic towards Jack, making smack talk about him behind his back and she had clearly sided with Andy during the captain's race.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> However, when Andy and Jack got back together, Maya didn't know and was hurt when she found out, thinking Andy had betrayed her, but the girls resolved their differences.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)]], x (S)</ref> Later, at the skyscraper, Maya helped Andy look for Jack.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the skyscraper and the end of Andy and Jack's relationship, Maya and Jack were often seen bickering and throwing light-hearted insults at each other. When Ripley revealed that Maya had applied to be a lieutenant, Jack told her he was ready to take her on if she tried to take his job since there could only be two lieutenants at the station. At the police training, they worked together and competed for the attention of policewoman [[Elle Kingsley]], and eventually both got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> When Pruitt drew everyone's attention to Jack's PTSD, Maya participated in the intervention. However, Jack got angry at everyone and told Maya she had no chance to take his job from him. When the team went to look for Herrera and Sullivan, Pruitt as acting captain benched Jack and ordered Maya to act as temporary lieutenant. Four months after the windstorm, Maya was meeting Jack after every therapy session and showing her support, telling him he would eventually return to active duty. She also invited him to Andy's party, but he declined.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Jack were both on Aid Car during the next shift, but Maya didn't think that Jack was ready to be back to work. The two responded to the train crash which turned into an infectious disease call and even though they were arguing in the beginning, they later started working together to treat the patients. Afterwards, while waiting to be cleared, the two resolved their differences and later had sex while showering at Maya's apartment.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref> While Jack wanted to clear things up between them, Maya told him she was telling Andy about what had happened and that nothing would happen between them ever again. However, when Maya tried to tell Andy, they were interrupted by Ryan and his date.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\nLater, Maya noticed that Jack was doing the quiet thing, meaning he was angry and out of concern, she asked what happened. Jack told her that seeing Dean with his family brought up feelings about his own and he told Maya that he didn't actually know who his biological parents were. Maya tried helping him by suggesting he internet-stalk them, but he brushed her off and told her he didn't want her help. However, Maya still cared and she told him so on the rooftop of the station, adding that he was the last person she expected to care about. She then walked away, but turned around and kissed him passionately.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref> The two then continued to hook up in secret. While having beer for breakfast after shift at the houseboat, Miller asked Jack to point out why Maya would make a terrible fake girlfriend for him, but Jack simply complimented Maya, saying that \"her eyes sparkle even in the dark\", proving he also had feelings for her.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy brought up the fact that she and Jack were on good terms, Jack went to Maya and told her they needed to tell Andy, but Maya suggested they have a last secret hookup in a supply closet before telling Andy the truth. However, Andy found them and she and Maya got into a big argument about it as Andy felt humiliated.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> During overhaul at the coffee processing plant, Dean revealed that he knew about Maya and Jack as they often snuck in and out of the houseboat and Maya was eager to talk to someone about all of her feelings as Andy was still mad at her.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref>\ua\n\nAfter Ripley died, Maya was visibly sad and constantly crying and Jack tried to ask her what was going on, but Maya denied the fact that she was crying. Later, Dean used an analogy with sea anemones to explain their behavior to them why Maya was crying and the fact that Jack wasn't actually annoyed with her as well as the fact that the two didn't know how to act now that they were officially together. At the funeral, Maya held Jack's hand during Sullivan's eulogy.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the bar crash, Maya sat down with Jack and told him he is good in bed and he is a good guy. He caught on to what Maya was intending. He asked if it was because she was interested in getting promoted to captain. She neglected to answer the question. She said they should just be friends.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Nicole|Nikki]]\nWhen Maya met Dean's girlfriend, Nikki, she was surprised that it was one of her exes.<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nCarina met Maya at the [[Emerald City Bar]] where she recognized Maya from when she brought in a patient's nose.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> Carina offered to buy her a drink if she told the story. Maya said she was drinking alone. Carina asked if she was sure, and Maya said she was maybe not sure.<ref>[[Into the Woods]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya called Carina when JJ went into labor at the fire station. They later FaceTimed, and Carina said they could talk about anything and any time Maya wanted.<ref>[[Ice Ice Baby]], x (S)</ref>\n\nCarina came to the station and brought lasagna for Maya because she heard from Ben that Maya had had a rough day. Maya said that all they did was hook up and she didn't need a girlfriend. Carina went to leave but then Maya apologized. Carina closed the door and they started kissing.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter they had sex one day during Carina's lunch break, Maya had a breakdown and said she was the truck that destroyed the family of Station . Carina comforted her.<ref>[[Born to Run]], x (S)</ref>\n\nCarina told Maya to speak her truth in Italian, and then they started kissing.<ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya asked Carina if she wanted to take some days off and go on vacation together. Carina gladly accepted.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOn vacation, Carina and Maya had drinks by the pool when a man named [[Todd (No Days Off)|Todd]] started to flirt with them. Carina commented that men are idiots in Italian. Todd thought she was speaking Spanish and tried to reply. Maya challenged him to a push-up battle and if she won, he would them drinks and leave them alone. He accepted the challenge and quickly lost. Maya ordered another round drinks on Todd's tab and Carina added french fries and mozzarella sticks. They then shared a kiss while the men looked at them in surprise.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya's phone chimed and she found out about the four-alarm fire back in Seattle. Carina assured her that everyone else would respond to the fire and that she couldn't help from , miles away. Maya started to have a panic attack about how she should be there helping. Carina told her that emergencies happen every day and that they all get fixed even without her. She held Maya's face and helped her calm down.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Carina met Maya's mother, she went to comfort Maya because of her mother's statement that what her father did to them was abuse. Carina explained to her that she loved her own father so much it took her a long time to realize that what he did to them, letting them live in fear, wasn't okay. Although Maya kept saying that her father never hit her or her brother, meaning he wasn't abusive. Maya then decided she needed to go for a run to blow off some steam. After she came back, she saw that Carina never left. Carina said she stayed there in case Maya wanted to talk. Maya told her to leave and admitted that she slept with Jack just an hour before she got back.<ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter an encounter with her father that included her father grabbing her ponytail while she was working, Maya cut off her own ponytail in the station bathroom. Jack saw this and told her a sorry could go a long way with Carina. She went to the hospital to apologize to Carina and found her in line at the coffee cart, where she told Carina she was right. Her dad was abusive to her. She apologized to Carina and begged her to get back together. She said she loved Carina. She added that she'd never said that to anyone but her brother, so it was a big deal for her. [[Teddy Altman]], also in line at the coffee cart, encouraged Carina to forgive Maya. Carina said Maya slept with her ex-boyfriend, and did that to hurt Carina. Maya told her she was willing to spend the rest of her life trying to prove to Carina that Maya could be trusted. Teddy said Carina should forgive Maya if she truly loved her. Carina told Maya she loved her too. They made up with a kiss.<ref>[[Louder Than a Bomb]], x (S)</ref> \n\nOnce things settled down, Carina had to go back to Italy because of her expiring visa. Marriage was the only way to stop Carina from going back, so Maya suggested it. Carina stated she wanted kids but didn't want to get married. After a large fight, Carina left for the airport without Maya. In the car, her friend, Gabriella, called her and told her she should not let Maya go, as she'd seen how happy Maya made her, even while she was grieving her brother. As Maya and Andy were discussing the fight, Carina came running back from the car, stating that she would much rather do something she didn't want to do than lose Maya. Then, Carina proposed and Maya happily accepted.<ref>[[Comfortably Numb]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nGrowing up, Maya never saw her father as abusive toward her. She always said that he really cared for her and her career as a runner. Lane Bishop often pushed Maya to be her \"best\" and would punish her if she didn't do well enough. Once she came in first place a track meet, but she didn't beat her time. Her father made her walk home over  miles. The next time she ran, she beat her best time.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x (S)</ref> Her parents put lots of money and attention towards her Olympic dreams, but they often put Maya and her training ahead of her brother, [[Mason Bishop|Mason]].<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter a call which included abusive couple who had a baby, Andy went to go talk to Maya, asking her if it reminded Maya of her father. Maya said no, because her father raged and threw things, but never at people and never in front of the neighbors. Maya talked about how Mason was like their mother and buried his head in the sand. She just wanted to please her father. She made herself a perfect copy of her dad so that he wouldn't find a reason to be mad at her. Over the years, she learned his sighs, the looks, the hunch of his shoulders. She was scared that by protecting herself from him that she was turning into him and she didn't want that. She told Andy she didn't want to be like him. For her thirteenth birthday, she was allowed to have a couple friends over to spend the night. She didn't have three close friends but she invited three softball players from her team to spend the night. They hung out in the basement and did all the typical sleepover things. At that age, Maya knew that she wasn't completely straight, but pretended during the sleepover. One girl, Holly, went to kitchen during the movie and came back with a soda. Maya freaked out because those were her dad's and no one was allowed to touch them. Holly didn't see the problem as it was just a can of soda. A few minutes later, Lane came tearing down the stairs, asking who drank his last soda. He yelled at Holly and took the soda back. Holly called her mom and went home crying. Maya told Andy she woke up that morning to all of Carina's things in the apartment and felt this rage build up inside of her. She was so used to having control over every space in her apartment and was terrified that she would be like her father, that she would snap at Carina. Due to Lane's parenting, Maya was afraid she wouldn't be able to love Carina the way she deserved to be loved. Andy told her that because she didn't want to end up like her father, that she was nothing like him.<ref>[[Don't Look Back in Anger]], x</ref>\n\nThe day of the Maya's and Carina wedding, Maya told Carina that she never told her she was bisexual or even that she was getting married, stating she didn't think they would care or be proud of her. She went to their house and told them she is bisexual, in love with a woman, and getting married to her. She told her mom that she didn't deserve to be cowering behind Lane in the hallway and invited her mom to come live with her and Carina. Lane tries to talk to her, but Maya cut him off and left. Maya's mother came to the wedding alone.<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Andy Herrera]]\nMaya and Andy are best friends and each other's confidant.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> They met at the fire academy and banded together as they were the only two women in their class and have been best friends ever since.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> However, when Andy snapped at Maya that the Captain's race wasn't her fight, Maya backed off and was cold toward Andy.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref> She continued to ignore Andy, but after realizing you should let the people you love in, she went to find Andy, but was shocked to see Jack's uniform top outside the Captain's bedroom.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref> While on a stakeout together, unable to leave, they started talking and sorted through their issues together.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\uaWhile trapped in a burning garage with no way out, the two worked together to find a way to escape and Andy was worried when Maya was knocked over from the explosion.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref> Maya also helped Andy look for Jack during the skyscraper fire.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\ua\n\nWhen Andy decided she needed to move out of her father's house, Maya supported her and offered to let Andy move in with her. However, later that day, when Andy jeopardized Maya's shot at rescuing [[Max Forrester|a kid]], Maya was angry at her.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\uaThe two later resolved their differences and Andy often came into Maya's bathroom while Maya was showering to ask her for advice. When Ripley announced that Maya had applied for lieutenant and she would have an interview, Andy was upset Maya hadn't told her. Maya later confessed she hadn't told her because she didn't want her and Andy to get competitive, but Andy told her she wasn't afraid to get competitive with her. Later, when Sullivan took his anger out on Maya during the police training, Andy took Maya's side and yelled at Sullivan.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> The next shift, Andy and Maya worked together on Aid Car and Maya was supportive of Andy who was worried Sullivan would fire her, but Sullivan didn't.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\nDuring the windstorm, Maya was initially rostered on Aid Car,\uabut Andy took her place along with Sullivan so Maya could impress Chief Ripley. When Ripley announced that Maya would be promoted to lieutenant at station , Maya tried to call Andy to tell her the news, but it went to voicemail.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya was worried about Andy when Ripley told the team that she and Sullivan hadn't reached Rainier First Hospital and she drove the firetruck and helped rescue Andy and Sullivan. She attended Andy's Medal of Valor ceremony and later hosted a party at their apartment for the occasion. Maya also teased Andy about having sex with Ryan in her room during the party.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref> When Andy didn't want to give an interview about winning her Medal of Valor, Maya supported her, but told her that she'd lost her \"firegasm\" and the two worked together to help a woman with fake amnesia to see her son before his surgery. The two also agreed to have shower boundaries.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> After Maya and Jack had sex for the first time, Maya wanted to tell Andy about it, but kept getting interrupted by Andy's own issues with Ryan and later decided to continue keeping her relationship a secret.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref> After agreeing to finally tell Andy the truth, Maya and Jack decided to secretly hookup one last time, but Andy found them in the supply closet. Andy slammed the door in anger and ignored Maya throughout the drive to the call, but made it clear that she was mad at her best friend. Later, Maya and Andy argued again and Andy said she felt humiliated that Maya didn't think enough of Andy to tell her she was seeing Andy's ex-boyfriend.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref>\ua\n\nAfter Chief Ripley died, Vic crashed with Andy and Maya and the two took care of her by making her breakfast and trying to reach her when she wasn't in her room despite the tension between them. Maya asked Andy if they should talk later, but Andy said they should just focus on Vic. Later at the funeral, Andy and Maya talked and Maya apologized for not telling Andy about Jack and Andy accepted her apology before Maya asked Andy how she was coping with the funeral. After the funeral, while at the bar, Andy and Maya talked about Andy and Jack and Vic. Andy then told Maya that Ryan had thought that she and Sullivan were together. Maya told Andy that she'd seen their moment at the hospital, too, but Andy refused to believe it.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n\nMaya is a firefighter at [[SFD Station |Station ]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]]. When Sullivan assigned the team special skills, Maya got assigned incident operations.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\uaAt Ripley's recommendation and Sullivan's insistence, Maya applied to be a lieutenant and was promoted shortly after.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref><ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen she was initially promoted to lieutenant, she was supposed to transfer to station . After the storm, with Jack benched, Maya acted as temporary second lieutenant.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref> However, when she was supposed to transfer, Sullivan asked Chief Ripley to let him have all three lieutenants, which meant that Maya remained at station  as a lieutenant.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Ripley died and Robert was promoted to Battalion Chief, Maya advocated for herself to be appointed Captain. She was granted the promotion, making her the youngest Captain ever in the Seattle Fire Department as well as the first female Captain at Station .<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nShe is a former Olympic athlete.

She was briefly engaged to [[Lucas Ripley]] until his death. She is in a relationship with [[Theo Ruiz]].\n\n\n\nGrowing up, Victoria mainly lived with her grandmother Marion due to her parents being busy at their restaurant. While her father valued good grades, her grandmother was less strict and valued fun in life over professional success. She shared her love of musicals and singing talent with Vic. Over time, Vic learned to care for her grandmother as she began suffering from dementia. Vic landed the lead role in a performance of ''Pirates of Penzance'' and invited her parents to the premiere. They disappointed her by not showing up. Her grandmother, at that point heavily demented, used one of the tickets Vic had saved for her parents to get into the theater and loudly started singing along to \"Poor Wandering One,\" one of the songs she and Vic used to sing together when she was younger. Marion even walked onto stage, further disrupting the performance.<ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBy , her grandmother passed away and her parents returned to work almost immediately, leaving Vic to process her grief alone. At the time, she had landed the lead role in a musical and her emotions got the better of her during rehearsals. The director, [[Cooper]], told her not to apologize for it as her emotional life had been part of the reason why he had chosen her for the role. During rehearsals, [[Pruitt Herrera|Captain Pruitt Herrera]] and a colleague arrived to make sure everything was up to fire safety regulations. Having passed the process with flying colors multiple times before with other productions, Cooper convinced him to let it slide this once to spare them all the time. Soon after, during a final rehearsal, a fire broke out backstage. The entire production's cast and crew managed to make it to the exit, except for Cooper, who tried to save an expensive piano. Vic, who had stayed in the room to make sure everyone made it out safely, witnessed his pants getting caught on fire. She ran back to the stage as Station  arrived. Pruitt pulled her away from the stage and took her outside while Cooper was being burned alive. The whole experience made her decide to get into the Fire Academy and she ended up working with Pruitt at Station .<ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref> By , she joined the station as the new probie. On her first day, she met Travis in the locker room as he was crying over his husband's death. Her humor and cheerful demeanor made him laugh for the first time since Michael's death, marking the start of their close friendship.<ref>[[No One is Alone]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy was confused about her feelings, she called Maya and Vic to drink and hang out. They talked on the porch and admitted Ryan's looks when he came over to talk to Andy.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nVic tested out the fire simulator while no one else was around. When a fire burst toward her, she flinched and pulled the goggles off her face, making Ben suspect something was wrong.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen noticed Vic seemed to have a fear of fire after the tanker fire. He tried to help her, but she denied there was a problem. However, she later confessed to the rest of the team that she was afraid and they offered to help her without telling Jack or Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTo help her, Travis took her to meditation class, where she just fell asleep due to being woken up so early.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Maya noticed Vic just starting at the flames and stood with her when she said it helped.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nVic was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station . In the interview, she criticized Ripley, saying that one of his departments, Station , was so slow that it forced Station  to stop and help. She then said he either had to pick Jack or Andy. Vic apologized for that, but Ripley said she could go, that she'd told him everything he needed to know about how Jack and Andy captained her.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. Outside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount. The trapped were freed when they used the water heater to cause an explosion and compromise the door just enough to give them access.\n\nWhen Jack later asked Dean what happened with the access pad, Vic covered for him and he assured her there wouldn't be a next time.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the law firm, Maya and Vic worked with [[Molly]], the fire coordinator for the floor who took her job very seriously. They had her watch the stairwell while they checked the floor. When the evacuation was started, they had to keep the civilians calm as they waited for their turns. They sent the first group down with Molly, but when the fire jumped floors through the windows, the civilians panicked and started running down the stairs, which led to them trampling Molly. Maya and Vic worked on fighting the fire and Vic found that she wasn't afraid anymore.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nVic and Maya were evacuating the skyscraper together when they met up with Andy. Andy insisted on staying to rescue Jack, so Maya decided to stay with her to help and sent Vic down to find more people to help. On her way down, she found Travis, who had been left by Ben. She started tending to him and then dragging him down when she found that he was still alive. When Dean came back into the skyscraper and found them, he helped her get Travis out and into an ambulance to the hospital. When they arrived at the hospital, she was upset to see Ben because he'd left Travis. They waited for news on Travis and Molly and after learning that Molly had died, Vic asked Ben if he believed that Travis would live. He said that he hoped so. Travis ultimately survived his surgery and spent several weeks recovering afterward.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety. Throughout the ordeal, Vic was annoyed that [[Andrew DeLuca]] had been brought along to help, though at the end of the day, he gave her the number of [[David Mayhorn]], another firefighter who had a crush on her.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSullivan had suggested a peer group for firefighters to Travis and Vic to work out their conflict. They weren't going to go, but ultimately chose to. They were surprised to hear [[Lucas Ripley|Fire Chief Ripley]] talk about the skyscraper fire and the trauma he still experienced in the aftermath. After the group was over, Vic found him and apologized for yelling at him at the fire. He suggested that at the next group, she should speak about her own experiences.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Vic was paired with Andy in a group that contained Ryan. Vic tried to force them to talk by suggesting that Ryan go first.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated. At the party, Vic and Ripley flirted over the cake.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. After breaking up the whole tree, they finished the drive to the house, where a fire had started during a rescue. The fire was then extinguished. Ripley then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor. Vic didn't attend this party because she was spending time with Ripley instead.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Ripley had told his sister about their relationship, Vic decided to tell Travis. He was shocked to learn she'd been hooking up with the Chief.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Kathleen Noonan|Kat]] came into the station to check it out, she met Andy and Vic. She was looking around at all the stations to see where she might fit in, but she didn't believe she'd be able to get a spot at . Andy decided to give her a proper tour. Andy and Vic then talked to Kat about her experience at the Academy and not feeling like she was improving. They suggested rice. They got two bowls of rice and had Kat grip and release it to improve her grip strength. They said Kat needed to find a way to distinguish herself. She revealed that the skyscraper fire had inspired her to apply to the academy, as she'd been working in the building. At the end of the day, Andy introduced Kat to Sullivan.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. After getting hit by the patient's hand, Vic stepped away to help Andy treat the daughter, giving her glucose and orange juice when she passed out from low blood sugar. She then stepped in to help stabilize the building.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nRipley died from the consequences of hydrofluoric acid poisoning with Vic by his side. After his death, she let his sister and Robert handle the funeral arrangements as she had decided she wasn't going. Her crew tried to convince her to go, but she insisted on not attending. In Travis's final attempt, she revealed she didn't want to go because she was no one to Ripley on paper. However, she changed her mind when Levi showed up at the station with a bouquet and told her that Lucas wanted to give her flowers that said that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. She went to the funeral and was invited by Jennifer to sit with her. Afterwards, she went to her and Lucas's diner and told Cameron that they were not married and that he had died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria tends to meddle where she doesn't belong while revealing little to nothing about her own personal life. As the youngest member of the team, she is eager to prove herself as a crucial part of the team. She's fun-loving, sarcastic, and loyal.\n\n\n\n[[David Mayhorn]]\nAfter rescuing Max Forrester, Andrew DeLuca gave Vic the number of a firefighter from Station , David Mayhorn.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref> The two went out and had sex at Vic's apartment. The next morning, they woke up and said that neither of them usually did that, then proceeded to have sex again.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref> Vic referred to him as a very tall man blanket and nicknamed him Man Blanket .<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> According to Maya, Vic saw him three times a month before the windstorm, but the two ended things before Vic started seeing Ripley.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Lucas Ripley]]\nDuring the Captain peer reviews, Vic yelled at [[Lucas Ripley|Chief Ripley]] for not doing his job and making sure all stations were as good as Station , stating that it took Station  eight minutes to get to the call which affected the team of .<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref> After the skyscraper, Vic and Ripley had another confrontation in which she blamed him for evacuating the entire building with her whole team still inside and he told her if she came at him like that again, he'd fire her.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen she saw him at the firefighter peer support group, she was surprised to hear that he struggled with the aftermath of the skyscraper fire. After the meeting, she apologized for any role she might have played in his feelings.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> They then flirted at the police training session, which came to a head at Dean's birthday party, where they flirted over cake before eventually sleeping together after shift.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> The next morning, she woke up while he was in the shower and decided to sneak out before he finished. She worried about what that said all day and asked [[Jack Gibson|Gibson]] for advice, but when he called at the end of the day, she answered and they presumably agreed to continue seeing each other.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref> Ripley visited Station  during the windstorm as it was central to the storm, but worried that it would seem like he was there to see her, not that he didn't want to see her, but they were at work. Vic said it wouldn't and that they could be professional at work. After working together on a call breaking up a tree, Vic and Ripley agreed that what they'd done was hot and hooked up at the station.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ripley promoted Maya to lieutenant at station , Maya asked Vic for details (because Vic was seeing Mayhorn from ) in front of Ripley. Vic quickly shut down the line of questioning. Ripley later tried asked Vic about Mayhorn, but they were interrupted by Pruitt. During Jack's intervention, he almost exposed Vic and Ripley's secret relationship, but was interrupted by Ripley with news about Herrera and Sullivan.\n\nFour months after the windstorm, they were still seeing each other. They went to Astro Corner Coffee Shop so they could eat together in public. They then started to have sex in the parking lot, but the manager caught them and asked them not to.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Ripley had told his sister about them, Vic started to consider telling someone herself. She decided to tell Travis and told Ripley that she'd told her best friend. Not realizing that meant Travis, Ripley said he knew that she had the sense to tell someone away from the station.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile working together after the RV crashed into the station, Ripley figured out that Travis was the best friend that Vic had told about their relationship. He confronted Vic about it and Vic revealed that Gibson also knew about them. The two argued in Vic's bunk. Vic asked if their conversation should be over, but Lucas decided to walk away before he said something he didn't mean.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Vic saved a stranded couple and delivered their baby, Lucas was checking up on her in the Aid Car, but Vic told him she didn't need him and that she was awesome to which he responded that he knew. Later, Lucas was taking care of Vic at her apartment and Vic confronted him that they hadn't finished their fight and told him he was wrong because if an argument was all it took to break them up, they shouldn't even be together, so if they couldn't fight and make up, he could take his nice-smelling shirt and go. Lucas responded that he didn't want his shirt back and that no matter what, he didn't want to go, \"I don't want to let you go.\" He then got into bed with Vic despite the fact that she was sick.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSometime after this, Lucas christened Vic with her nickname, \"Eggy\" because of the dish she ordered for breakfast at the Astro Corner Coffee Shop. The manager of the diner apologized about scolding them when they were about to have sex in the parking lot and said they were relationship goals. He also assumed that Vic and Lucas were married, calling Lucas Vic's hubby. Lucas then told Vic about his previous wives and that if he would get married a third time, he would take it very seriously and he wouldn't be game unless he knew it was really right.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> Around this time, Vic met Jennifer, Lucas' sister, and the two hit it off even when Vic told her about how the two of them jumping out of planes during the weekends.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDuring the blackout, Lucas dropped by the station and, upon seeing Pruitt happy from his vacation, suggested he and Vic also take a vacation, but Vic reminded him of why that wouldn't work and all the other strings involved. When the lights went off at the station, Vic and Lucas made out in the hallway. After the call, Vic came home to Lucas and he told her he had vacation days and didn't want to be the guy who didn't use them. They agreed to go and Vic said it didn't matter where because life is too short before realizing it wouldn't work out because it could ruin their careers. Lucas then suggested that maybe they shouldn't be a secret anymore and they shared a kiss.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe next morning, they were in their diner discussing their options, and when Lucas told Vic about the disciplinary action involved if they went public, Vic was ready to back out. Lucas then suggested marriage as a way to cheat the system since rank didn't affect spouses working in the same department, but both of them decided it was too crazy before agreeing to explore other options. After Lucas went into a coffee processing plant to rescue the captain of station , Vic told him that they were reckless and that getting married to cheat the system wasn't them before proposing to him for real. Before he could say anything, she panicked and told him he didn't have to answer right then, so they agreed to meet at their diner in the morning for breakfast. The next morning, Vic went to the diner and waited for Lucas for two hours but he didn't show, so Vic stormed out, thinking he'd stood her up, and went to help with overhaul.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> \n\nUnbeknownst to her, Lucas was hospitalized due to a pre-existing condition and the effects from inhaling chemicals at the fire. While Lucas tried to reach her [[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|px|Vic and Lucas share one last kiss and say goodbye]]himself, her team found her and told her what was happening while Vic was rescuing a victim. Vic managed to complete the rescue before rushing off to the hospital, regretting the fact that her last words to Lucas were \"okie dokie\". At the hospital, Vic got into a fight with Jennifer because Jennifer blamed Vic for Lucas' condition. When she found out Vic had proposed, Jennifer allowed Vic to see Lucas and when it was clear Lucas was dying, Jennifer told Vic to go say goodbye to him. The couple reunited, albeit briefly. Vic said they could finally take that vacation and described their dream vacation. Lucas then accepted Vic's proposal and asked if they could get someone in the room to get married, but Vic just wanted to have the moment with him, just them. A crying Vic told him she was really ready to spend the rest of her life with him and Lucas said that at least he got to spend the rest of his with her. They shared a kiss and Vic held his hand until he died. Later, Vic was lying on top of the firetruck crying over her dead fianc\ue as she remembered when they said \"I love you\" for the first time while her team surrounded her.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Lucas died, Vic crashed with Andy and Maya, but left their apartment to go to the diner. When asked where her \"hubby\" was by the manager, Vic lied and said he was at work. Later, she went to work where she tried to act like nothing had happened despite the fact that it was the day before Lucas' funeral and everyone was concerned. She also announced that she wasn't going to the funeral, much to her team's disappointment. Travis, Sullivan, and Jennifer all tried to convince her to attend the funeral, but Vic refused, saying that she was nothing to Lucas. While arguing with Travis, she referred to Lucas as someone who could have been the love of her life, but wasn't her husband. Later, [[Levi Schmitt]] brought Vic a bouquet of flowers that was similar to the one Lucas had bought for her, telling her that Lucas said the bouquet meant he wanted to spend his entire life with her. This finally conviced Vic to attend the funeral and she joined Jennifer who asked her to sit in the area reserved for family members. Vic was devastated and she cried at the funeral before telling Andy and Maya she wanted to be alone afterwards. She took the bouquet of flowers and went to the diner where she told Cam the manager of the diner that Lucas wasn't her husband and she'd lied about him being at work before admitting that Lucas had died.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nVic met Jackson when she responded to a call and found him holding [[Jai Prishna]], who was dangling from a rope over a cliff. She helped him wench Jai up to safety. Later, when she was at the hospital to drop off another patient, he asked her to go get burgers, but she said maybe another time. Later, they had lunch together in the park and talked about Jai. She told him about Lucas dying and he told her about his recent breakup with Maggie. They both agreed that it wasn't a great time for either of them to start a new relationship. Despite this, they continued to see each other, though it remained mostly platonic.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n[[Theo Ruiz]]\nShe and Theo flirted over their morning jog.<ref>[[Don't Look Back in Anger]], x (S)</ref> He later asked her out on a date after seeing her outside her parents' restaurant, which he said had the best pierogi in town. She turned him down, saying she wasn't really dating because of the pandemic.<ref>[[Out of Control]], x (S)</ref> However, at a later meeting, Vic said she may have been a little rash turning him down and they made arrangements to go for a date after their next Covid test.<ref>[[Learning to Fly]], x</ref> The date went well, but while they were together, Theo got a call asking him to sub at station  the next day. Vic asked him not to tell anyone they were seeing each other and he agreed to that. When they were at the station, Vic learned that Theo was previously a captain and was the reason Travis's husband, Michael, was dead. Vic told him they couldn't see each other anymore because of that, but later comforted him when he said that day didn't just haunt Travis.<ref>[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Maya and Carina's wedding, Anthony Hughes invited Theo to join the celebration. He did and after the wedding, he ended up kissing Vic outside her parents' restaurant.<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Anthony Hughes]] and [[Lenya Hughes]]\nHer parents own [[Kaminski's]], a restaurant that serves Polish food. It's not successful enough for them to hire help so they run it themselves and are there all the time. As such, they don't have free time to visit their daughter, which means she has to go to the restaurant if she wants to see them.<ref>[[Eulogy]], x (S)</ref> Their restaurant got destroyed during a protest, which brought Vic and her parents together.<ref>[[Say Her Name]], x (S)</ref> It was remodeled in time for [[Maya and Carina's Wedding]].<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Marion Hughes]]\nVic had a strong relationship with her grandmother. She would watch movies with her and share her grades with her. Her grandmother developed dementia though and would forget things. Vic was often the one taking care of her grandmother and making sure she took her pills. Vic's grandmother's favorite show was \"Pirates Of Penzance\" <ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Travis Montgomery]]\nTwo weeks after his husband died, Travis was working at Station , where he met Vic. They had a rocky start because she disliked him second-guessing her, but Vic helped him through his grief and they bonded as Travis pushed Vic to train harder and do better.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> \n\nWhen Vic struggled with her fear of fire, she told her team while Andy and Jack were at the Incinerator and the team promised to help her overcome it while keeping it a secret from the two lieutenants as they were required to report it. Travis took Vic to meditation class where they ran into Grant and later helped Maya run some drills with Vic.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nVic was the one who found Travis in the stairwell at the skyscraper fire and dragged him down the stairs before running into Miller who helped her carry Travis outside. She rode with Travis in the Aid Car and waited for news on his condition with Warren and Grant.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon his return to work, Travis noticed some tension between himself and Vic. He asked her about it, but she denied anything was wrong. This later built up to a fight when she revealed that she was upset that he'd quit on life in the skyscraper. Sullivan told them to stop fighting at the station and suggested a peer support group where they could go.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref> After the peer support group, their friendship seemed to be on the mend as they were seen discusing Travis and Grant's relationship and Vic told her friend he needed to spice things up.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> When Travis was struggling with the fact that Grant didn't want to get married, he asked Vic for her advice and she told him that marriage wasn't everyone's endgame.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter she found out that Ripley told his sister about their relationship, Vic told Travis who was shocked and the two discussed Ripley being Vic's new hobby. Vic also comforted Travis when he revealed he was still hung up on Michael.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> Travis knowing later led to Vic and Ripley's first fight when he accidentally revealed to the latter that he knew about their secret relationship.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref> When Vic was upset after her and Ripley's fight, Travis comforted her but sent her home when she was sick.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Ripley ran into the burning coffee plant to rescue another captain, Travis made sure to support Vic and when Vic returned to overhaul, Travis asked her what had happened with Ripley since he knew about the proposal.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> Travis was worried to tell Vic about Ripley's condition while she was on the tower, but at Herrera's insistence, he radioed Vic and told her what had happened. He later told Vic that if she needed him to hunt down Dr. Pierce for her he would. When Vic had to go and say goodbye to Lucas, Travis held her hand as they walked through the hallway and he also hugged her when the entire team laid down with Vic on the firetruck while she cried over the loss of Ripley.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Ripley died, Travis was very concerned for Vic and he was surprised when she was back at work. He offered to take Vic to his place or to Andy and Maya's as Vic wasn't back at her apartment, but Vic refused and lashed out. When Vic said she wasn't coming to the funeral, Travis constantly tried to convince her to come which led to a fight between the two in which Vic pointed out the differences between her and Travis' experiences with loss, adding that she wasn't Travis and Lucas wasn't Travis' husband. In the end, though Vic did go to the funeral.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\n\n\nVictoria is a firefighter at [[SFD Station |Station ]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]]. She is the youngest recruit at the station and eager to prove her worth because of it. Her special skill is regulating her O intake.

She is the daughter of [[Elena Herrera]] and the now deceased [[Pruitt Herrera]]. She is divorced from [[Robert Sullivan]] as she believes his actions led to her transfer and [[Maya Bishop|Maya Bishop's]] demotion.\n\n\n\nAndy was practically raised at the station. She learned to run a hose from her father at age seven.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nAt age , she lost her mother.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> On the day of her mother's funeral, she didn't speak. She went home with her father after the funeral. She sat in the hall as she listened to him ring the bell  times,  times at a time. This is to signify that a firefighter has come home for the last time.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref> She sat on her bed for a long time and wouldn't talk to [[Pruitt Herrera]], until [[Ryan Tanner]] came in they hugged and he helped her through it.<ref>[[Eulogy]], x (S)</ref> At the same, Pruitt cut off all communication with Elena's family, isolating Andy from them. Too wrapped up in her grief, she didn't notice and forgot about them.<ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen she was a senior in high school and dating Ryan, the couple thought that they would get married to one another. Andy became pregnant, but chose to have an abortion, because she knew that if she didn't, it would end her career before it started and she'd live a life full of resentment. She never told Ryan because she knew he would want to keep it and him wanting to keep it would make her want that.<ref>[[Searching for the Ghost]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nOn her first day at the fire academy, Andy met Maya. Andy tried to tell her they didn't have to be friends because they were the only two women. Maya said there's safety in numbers and they ended up sticking together. When Andy struggled with a hose drill, Maya coached her through it. On her graduation day, her father didn't come because he was bailing Ryan out of jail.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen two boys accidentally set a fire while home alone, Andy was on the team that put out the fire and rescued the boys. While transporting them to the hospital, Andy stuck her hand into an open wound on Zach's abdomen, which resulted in her holding his abdominal aorta in her hand. They very carefully unloaded him from the ambulance and wheeled them into the OR, where Andy had to help clamp off the blood flow so she could remove her hand. After being freed, she left the OR, but wanted to know the outcome of the case, so Ben took her to the gallery, where they watched the rest of the surgery, which Zach survived.\n\nAfter learning what Meredith was trying to do to continue her research, Andy took the phone from Taryn and spoke with the person on the line and convinced the owner of the patent to meet with Meredith to talk about allowing her use.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFrankel came to the station and explained to Jack and Andy the procedure for choosing a new captain, which would take months. She said they'd alternate as captain each shift until then. Andy went first. She had the team do air consumption drills with new partners. Frankel watched for a while and then said she could stop back in anytime.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed. Back on the ground, Frankel admonished both Jack and Andy for their choices, saying Andy should have listened to Jack's experience and Jack should have followed orders.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.\n\nLater, Andy overheard Frankel tell Jack she worried that Andy had been handed her promotion by her father. She went to her father, who reassured her that he made her lieutenant because she earned it.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy responded to a call for an Aid Car at a police stakeout, just in case anyone got hurt. They got bored as they waited in the ambulance, unable to leave. After the lost the video feed and heart gunshots, Andy, worried for Ryan, wanted to go in immediately, but Maya reminded her that they had to wait to be called. Not long after, they were called in and they learned that it was another officer, not Ryan, who had been shot and they took him to the hospital for an x-ray because the bullet had been caught by his vest.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy and Jack carpooled to The Incinerator, a test to determine one's suitability to be Captain. They arrived surprised to find so many candidates and only one open spot. They were put in a group with [[Charlotte Dearborn]] and [[Cole Edmonds]] to take the test. Cole went first and expected the women to watch while he and Jack did the rescue and talked down to them. Next was Charlotte, who was cavalier about safety, though she set a record time. During Jack's turn, they put out the fire, but after multiple sweeps, they didn't find the dummy, so Jack made the decision to leave without it. On the outside, he was informed that very few people mastered that variation of the test and there was no dummy in the first place. Finally, it was Andy's turn. She emphasized them working as a team. She had them hold on to each other due to low visibility. The building started to creak as they crawled along and eventually, the roof collapsed, separating them. Cole didn't respond to her calls, so they had to find him. He was unconscious. Charlotte then called for a mayday over Andy's objections. Frankel ordered everyone out, but Andy decided to stay in and find the dummy. Jack stayed with her and they retrieved the dummy. Once they were out, Frankel berated Andy for her decision to ignore the mayday call. Ripley interrupted and said he understood Andy's call, but they have rules for a reason. It's a Captain's job to remember that. In a real call, they'd all have come out in body bags. He understood, but didn't agree with, her call. On the way home, Jack said he needed to win it because he was still in it, but Andy refused to talk to him about it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the test, Andy was ranked last, but was determined not to give up.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy took an ambulance out to give hepatitis vaccines to unhoused people. They saw Mason, who declined a vaccine and Maya's help.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen her father stopped responding to treatment, Andy was surprised at home much her father had hidden from her about his treatment. She told him about her promising her mother she'd take care of him just before her death. After Pruitt crashed due an allergic reaction, he still insisted on continuing the treatment, but asked Bailey to keep Andy included on all his treatment from then on.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. With the fire in the house, the garage started to heat up. They searched for anything they could use to try to free themselves. They found a toolkit, which Karen used to pick the lock on the trunk of the car and retrieve a jack. They tried to use the jack to lift the garage door, but it wouldn't budge. As the temperature climbed, Ryan decided to hot wire the car and try to use it as a battering ram. Jack said it was a bad idea, but Ryan started it anyway. Andy was able to stop him before he moved the car. Jack had the idea to use the motor from the internal door to get access to the house. It didn't work and they started to wear out. When Pruitt arrived and gave Andy a pep talk, she used the last of her energy to think of a plan. She saw the water heater and decided they could use the pilot light to create an explosion. They siphoned gas from the car and rigged the water heater up to explode and propel itself through the garage door. It worked and once they were free, they were all cooled down and rehydrated.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was waiting for her final captain interview, a page came in about a skyscraper fire downtown, so Ripley said the interviews were being postponed until further notice. Jack then told her that if he didn't get captain, he was putting in for a transfer to another station.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the active fire, they worked with Charlotte, who made the decision to jump through the fire to try to get to a fire door. Then there was a crash and she didn't respond. Andy jumped after her and found her injured. She used an extinguisher sphere to put out the flames and let the rest of the group come help her free Charlotte. Andy took Charlotte down to triage and because the fire was contained, she sent Jack and Dean to the floor above to check it out. On that floor, they found a large amount of combustibles. A rapid evacuation was started. Andy dropped Charlotte at triage and then went back up to the top floor to tell them to get ready for evacuation. Then she went back downstairs and helped Ripley pack up and evacuate base camp. When Jack and Dean found a civilian as they closed fire doors, they called for an elevator evacuation. Ripley said no, but Andy took the elevator key and sent the elevator up. Jack sent Dean down with the civilian and continued his work. He talked to Andy through the elevator shaft. She tried to convince him to find a way out, but he said he wasn't willing to sacrifice the lives of anyone on the team to try to save himself. She asked him to stay on the radio, which he did until it cut out a few minutes later. Then there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy refused to leave the building without Jack. She asked Ripley to send more people up to help, but he refused and ordered her to evacuate. She ignored the order and began climbing the stairs to the floor where Jack was. On the way, she met Maya and Vic, who were on their way down. Andy said she wasn't leaving without Jack, so Maya decided to go with her to help while they sent Vic down to find more help. Andy and Maya got to the floor where Jack was and found the door jammed shut. Maya worried that that meant that it was so hot inside that it could kill them instantly. Despite this, she helped Andy open the door and they stepped inside. They immediately heard the beeping on Jack's PASS device, which they followed to find him. He was under a pile of rubble, which they moved to free him. The three of them then evacuated the building and Andy checked Jack out.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter an apartment fire, Andy and Dean brought [[Natalie Forrester]] to the hospital. She'd been evacuated from the building and then collapsed on the sidewalk. Andy offered to sit with her son, who was anxious, while they waited for his father to arrive. Andy and Dean then got checked out by Bailey, a new requirement by Sullivan. Dean then lingered because he had a crush on Maggie. At the end of the day, he asked her out, but she told him she had a boyfriend.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation. Andy talked to Zoe and said she should become a firefighter because she was the kind of person they needed on their team. She gave Zoe her number and Zoe later sent her a picture of her in the hospital, eating jello.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Andy was paired with Vic and Ryan was put in their group. Vic suggested that Ryan go first. Andy showed him how to do compressions and made him do them continuously even as he wore out, because his dummy hadn't beeped back to life. He eventually stopped over her objections. Also at the training, Andy stood up for Maya when she saw Maya being singled out for criticism by Sullivan.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy was on the Aid Car with Maya. Their first call involved a kid. It should have been a simple call, but the kid ran into a building with a gas leak, so they had to track down the kid and break through a wall. They came back to the station very dirty. After a shower, they tended to [[Greg Tanner]], who came in looking for Pruitt to patch him up after a fight. Andy tended to him instead and called Ryan, who didn't believe Greg when Greg told him he got in the middle of a fight defending a kid and his phone got broken. When she was finished treating Greg, they got called out again, to tend to an injured hiker. With difficulty, they found [[Clark]], who had fallen and had a branch puncturing his leg. After returning from a later call, she and Maya found Greg in an elevator, where he'd passed out. They suspected a cardiac bruise from the fight. They were able to restore sinus rhythm.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Sullivan and Andy went on the first call out. They went to the scene, where they found a car that had been hit by another car that then drove off. Unbeknownst to Andy, it was on the same stretch of road where Sullivan's wife had died. In the car, they found [[Shannon (Weather the Storm)|Shannon]], who said she was trying to escape the storm when she was hit. Her leg was broken, so they splinted it, but because of the high winds, they had difficulty wrapping her leg, so they moved her into the Aid Car. As they worked, Shannon asked if one of them could get her purse out of her car, as it had a necklace her grandmother gave her. Sullivan retrieved it for her. They were able to stabilize her leg, but the radios weren't working because of the storm, so they were unable to get advice from dispatch on where to take her and Sullivan wanted to wait for the all clear before leaving. However, when they noticed the wind was starting to move the Aid Car, they knew they needed to get out of there. They tried, but the Aid Car was blown off the edge of a cliff.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy and Sullivan woke up in the aid car. Shannon was also awake, but Sullivan was trapped under the collapsed dashboard. Andy got him freed and he planned to go for help, but he wasn't able to move or feel his legs. Andy got him on a backboard and tried to reassure him as she treated both him and Shannon. She then put out a small fire on the Aid Car to keep them safer. Andy stayed in the back with them and continued to monitor them. Shannon coded, but Andy was able to resuscitate. After she was in sinus rhythm again, Andy decided she needed to leave the Aid Car to set off the flares. Only one was still viable, so she took it and left the rig. She made the difficult climb up and set out the flare. While Andy was on her way back, Shannon coded again. Despite risk of paralysis, Sullivan unstrapped himself from the backboard and tried to reach the defibrillator. When he couldn't, he attempted a precordial thump. When Andy returned, she started compressions, but she was unable to resuscitate and Shannon died. Soon after, they were found and rescued by the team.\n\nFour months later, Andy was awarded a Medal of Valor for her actions. At the ceremony, she fled after receiving the medal. She avoided talking to Ryan about why. At the party celebrating her medal, she hooked up with Ryan.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy, Dean, and Maya responded to a call about a woman injured in the park. They arrived to see a confused woman on a park bench with a head wound. She couldn't remember anything about herself or how she was injured. While checking her for other injuries, Maya found a picture of a boy in her shoe. They finished checking her out and then dropped her off at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Later, they found her at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] when they were dropping off another patient. Andy went after her and got her to agree to come back to their rig. Maya and Dean went to investigate how she'd ended up there. Dean learned she was a fugitive and the cops wanted them to distract her to give them time to arrive. They learned she was [[Margaret Chen]]. Andy felt there was more going on, so she asked Margaret about it. She stole some money from her work to pay for her son's medical care. She was going to put it all back, but she got caught before she could. He was scheduled for his surgery that day and she wanted to see him before her surgery. They enlisted Ryan's help. They were able to sneak her into the hospital to see her son and then she was arrested and taken to court.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Kathleen Noonan|Kat]] came into the station to check it out, she met Andy and Vic. She was looking around at all the stations to see where she might fit in, but she didn't believe she'd be able to get a spot at . Andy decided to give her a proper tour. Andy and Vic then talked to Kat about her experience at the Academy and not feeling like she was improving. They suggested rice. They got two bowls of rice and had Kat grip and release it to improve her grip strength. They said Kat needed to find a way to distinguish herself. She revealed that the skyscraper fire had inspired her to apply to the academy, as she'd been working in the building. At the end of the day, Andy introduced Kat to Sullivan.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. While they worked on her, Andy took Ellie to the conference room to talk to her and keep her calm. As her mom was ready to be moved, she said she didn't want to go to the hospital with her because she felt she was always messing things up. Shortly afterward, she collapsed from low blood sugar. She was given glucose and quickly woke up, but still worried about her mom having another seizure and her not being able to help. Andy then sent Ellie to the hospital to be with her mom, while they dealt with the damage to the station caused by the crash and subsequent explosion.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen Ripley passed out on a sidewalk and was taken to the hospital, Sullivan, Ben, and Andy came to the hospital to check on his condition. Andy and Ben were surprised to learn that he'd been buying flowers for Vic when he passed out. After being banished from his room, they waited in the hospital waiting area. They were shocked when his lab results came back, showing his condition was much worse than previously believed and he had fled the hospital in search of Vic.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\n\nRyan surprised Andy by showing up on her doorstep one morning. As she questioned why he was suddenly back from San Diego, they heard someone down the hallway calling for help. They rushed to her neighbor's apartment and found her bleeding profusely from her wrists, having cut herself on a broken glass while doing the dishes. Andy and Ryan called Pruitt and his partner and applied pressure to the wound as they awaited his arrival. The two of them promised the woman they would watch her kids while Pruitt took her to the hospital. As they were babysitting, Ryan played cops and robbers with Milo. Andy talked about having a fall-out with her father over his slut-shaming her. Ryan then shared he had returned from San Diego because Jenna had cheated on him to hurt him after he had told her he was still in love with his ex. As it dawned on Andy that he was talking about her, Milo appeared with his mother's gun in his hands. She and Ryan tried to get Milo to hand over the gun, but he assumed they were still playing and he fired the gun, shooting Ryan. Andy rushed to apply pressure to the wound and called her father back. They tried to save him but he succumbed to his injuries.\n\nAfter his funeral, she insisted on working. Her grief manifested in a permanent angry mood. She snapped at a bridal shop owner who didn't want to leave her store despite a gas leak. Andy and her team worked to evacuate the street, as flammable gas was building up in the sewers underneath, but an explosion happened in the bridal shop. Andy and Jack found the owner still alive inside and managed to resuscitate her, but Andy couldn't feel joy over having saved the woman's life. Maya tried to help her but Andy needed a friend who would just let her be rather than try to help her. Maya said she could be that friend, but soon after, Andy found Maya coming out of a meeting with Sullivan and learned that she had been promoted to Captain of Station .\n\nAndy was furious and ignored Maya at home despite her attempts to please Andy. At work, Jack told Andy they all thought she would get the promotion. Andy sighed and rolled her eyes as Maya gave her first speech to the crew. She joined the crew for Maya's mandatory group work-out but skipped the second session Maya organized because of Dean's being late. She ran into Sullivan, who told her he had passed her over because you only get one shot at the Captain job and he had been afraid that her grief would cause her to screw it up. Maya approached Andy and pointed out they needed to work as a team. Defiantly, Andy said they still were a team and rallied the others to support her. As a fight was about to begin, Sullivan cut in and ordered the crew to accept his decision. Later, Andy told Maya she was furious with her because she accepted the job despite knowing that Andy had worked for and earned the job. The next day, Jack found her reminiscing over an old photo of the crew under Captain Herrera. He hated how Ryan's death had cost her the promotion. She said men deciding things for her to protect her was a recurring theme in her life. She also admitted she had stopped feeling anything except anger since Ryan's death. He understood her and took her the place where he briefly used to live as a kid, which was now an empty lot. As they sat down for breakfast there, they agreed to move in together as Andy couldn't bear to live with Maya anymore.\n\nMaya took the group on a mandatory camping trip to increase morale. While the group attempted to keep things light and fun, Maya had the entire trip scheduled out and was adamant about sticking to the schedule. Andy lashed out at her every chance she got. The next morning, the crew was woken up by screaming and found some other campers had been attacked by a bear. While the crew worked on saving them, Andy, Maya, Pruitt, and Jack went on a hunt to find the woman's nose, which had been ripped off. While doing so, they came across the bear and Andy gave the group instructions on how to scare it off. On the way home, Pruitt finally apologized for having slut-shamed her. She appreciated that and asked if there was something else he wanted to tell her. He denied that and brought up Ryan's death. She opened up about her grief, which caused her to feel angry at the whole world. At the bar, Jack told her he had been sleeping with fellow firefighter Rigo's wife, breaking the firefighter code. As he said he couldn't bring himself to stop, Andy said she wanted to feel something other than angry, so they came up with the idea of sleeping together to solve both their problems. As they were making out in the back room of the bar, they agreed it was helping to make them feel better.\n\nThe whole crew gathered at the station with civilians to sit out a massive blizzard. Andy kept her hostile attitude towards Maya, having found a companion in Jack. Andy and Maya sprung into action when JJ went into labor. As they were giving her some privacy, Maya told her she would continue to be her friend as she knew Andy would have the done the same thing had the tables been turned. She hoped Andy could see that once her grief over Ryan eased up a little. Andy snapped that two men decided behind closed doors that she wasn't fit for the job. She wasn't mad that Maya took the job, she was mad that Maya took the job without a word of acknowledgment, which would have told Andy that she wasn't a complete sociopath. She then pointed out Maya was running the firehouse into the ground and walked off. As they were delivering the baby, Maya confessed that she had fought for the job and hadn't just been given it because Andy wasn't fit for it. She told Andy that unlike her, she knew how to separate her personal and professional lives. She admitted she had been a crappy friend but she still cared for Andy. She compared herself to Pruitt, who had been hovering over Andy lately to make sure everything was all right for her. Andy then realized that Pruitt had been lying to her. He confessed he had testicular cancer and only had six months left to live as he was rejecting treatment. Andy broke down and fled to the bunk. Robert came in and held her as she cried.\n\nAs she came to terms with her father's diagnosis and impending death, Andy continued to sleep with Jack, whose secret had come out during the blizzard. She convinced him to return to work with her and own up to it. They were present for the presentation of Ben's PRT truck. Later, Robert checked in on and her. She blamed her breakdown on the birth and Pruitt's cancer, declining any further help. While out for a call involving an aircraft explosion, Pruitt came to help out with the injured citizens. Still mad at him for rejecting treatment, Andy asked Pruitt if he had told Pruitt about his diagnosis and if that was the reason behind her being passed over for Captain. Pruitt said they would talk later. Based on the debris, Andy pieced together that the exploded aircraft had been a rocket. She went to inform Rigo and Jack, who warned Rigo to stay away from a newly discovered gas tank leak. Given their feud, Rigo ignored him and as Jack pulled him back, he dropped his fire extinguisher, causing an explosion that left him eviscerated. Andy went to get Ben and then informed Maya of the situation, convincing her to finally call HazMat. Back at the station, Andy openly challenged Maya's decision to have Jack and Rigo work together. Maya stood by her decision, causing another fight between them. Maya announced to the crew that they needed to stop questioning her every move and either get in line or request a transfer. The crew kept their heads down. Later, Sullivan found Andy, who told him she knew that he had passed her over for Captain because of her father's diagnosis. His keeping that from her only made it worse for her. He blurted out that he was in love with her and had been for a long time, causing him to fail at everything. She coldly told him that she couldn't be mad at her father for their stunt with her promotion given his cancer, so she would take it out on him instead. She shut the door in his face.\n\n\nAndy and Jack slept together at the station and worked together closely given their mutual hate for Maya. Spending so much time with him, she came to notice that he had been falling apart ever since the Rigo incident. While responding to an accident involving multiple injured bikers, Jack refused to stop performing CPR on a biker until Andy pointed out to him that the man was a lost cause, saying this wasn't going to be the win that Jack apparently so desperately needed. Part of the crew took Emmett out for drinks at Joe's bar. Jack followed Andy to the toilets, assuming they were going to have sex, but she shut him down. She told him their sex had helped her, but now that she was feeling other things than anger again, she deemed having sex with him too messy. She left the bar and went to Robert's apartment. She told him she was done fighting and being angry. She wanted to be in a safe space, which for some reason was him. She asked him to kiss her, which would make everything okay for her for the first time in a long time. He did kiss her and took her inside.\n\n\nWhen the team was called in to a fire at a storage unit, they found a rock band playing in one of the units. One of their cigarettes caught on fire, and it spread through the vents. Eventually, there was no visibility in the building, and the entire Station  team was stuck. When Sullivan heard Andy had no exit and had only % air left, he ran into the fire to try and help her find the exit. They both became trapped. Pruitt was playing Texas Hold Em with some of his former fellow firefighters, and they tuned in to the radios at the fire. When Pruitt heard Andy was trapped, he rushed to the scene. Pruitt got Maya to get Ladder  to the roof of the building, and Pruitt made a vent on the roof and fell to his death. Pruitt was in his final months before this happened due to cancer, so Robert and Andy got married so Pruitt could be there. Andy took a few days off, and Warren gave her a pill to help her sleep, and it gave her crazy dreams. Robert stayed with her. Fire Chief Dixon said that Pruitt was a civilian when he died, so he couldn't get a line of duty funeral. Vic had everyone do a photoshoot for a calendar to raise money for the line of duty funeral, and they also held a spaghetti dinner fundraiser, which is where Robert announced that he and Andy were married. Before they could do the funeral for Pruitt, COVID- hit, so they did it virtually, and Andy gave the eulogy. \n\n\nWhen Andy got all of Pruitt's things after he died, she found some things that were questionable. She found birthday cards from her Tia Sandra that her dad never gave her. She asked Snuffy Souza, one of Pruitt's fellow firefighters whom she was close to, and he acted very odd in response to her questions. She repeatedly called Tia Sandra, who never picked up, so she left voicemails. Tia Sandra eventually did call back, but Andy was drunk at a party with the other firefighters of Station . The day after the party, it was the day of Robert's surgery for his chronic leg pain. From what Andy knew, she thought her mother killed herself because she experienced flashbacks to their last fun day together, and she expressed this to Meredith. When Robert woke up, Andy had driven to a motel, and found her Tia Sandra, and also found that her mother was alive. Her mother explained how she had bad mental health, so she just left, and how Pruitt had made up the story that she died. Andy also found out that when Pruitt went to New York to help with -, he begged her to come back to him and Andy, but she refused. \n<br />\n\nAndy is confident, badass, she plays by the rules, but will also bend them if the situation fits.\n\n\n\n[[Ryan Tanner]]\nRyan is Andy's oldest friend and her high school flame, an attraction that still lingers in their present interactions. After her father collapsed during a fire, Ryan was able to calm her down.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nLater, when she heard gun shots while they were on a stakeout, she worried that Ryan was the one shot and was extremely relieved when she learned he wasn't. Later that night, she knocked on his door, but fled before he answered.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the strip mall fire, Ryan came to Andy, pumped about what he'd done. He was exhilarated and he and Andy started kissing and undressing each other.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey continued having sex regularly in the mornings.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref> However, when Andy learned that Ryan deliberately didn't tell her that her dad was in trouble during the skyscraper fire, she ended things with him, saying they always ended up in the same pattern of him protecting her when she didn't need it.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMonths later, after she received a Medal of Valor for her actions during the windstorm, she and Ryan hooked up at her party.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref> They continued to hook up, but Andy stopped any conversation of their status.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> Later, after hearing Pruitt talk about getting too comfortable and wanting to move forward instead of backward, he asked Andy if he was just a security blanket for her.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile helping Vic through her pregnancy and her later decisions, she revealed that while dating Ryan in high school, she got pregnant her senior year. She told Vic that she had an abortion after seeing her career end before it began and that if she'd told Ryan, he'd want to keep the baby. Andy revealed that they weren't ready for a baby, so that was one factor that led to her decision. She never got the chance to tell him before he died. \n\n[[Jack Gibson]]\nJack and Andy secretly began sleeping together. When she found an engagement ring while they were having sex, she freaked out. Later, when Jack lost Pruitt while they were in a fire together, Andy got angry with him.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe two continuously bickered because of their different leadership styles, but\uathey began sleeping with each other again after a while to relieve the tension and postpone the conversation they knew they needed to have. He decided that sex was not enough for him, and that he wanted more, to build a home with someone. Andy said she didn't want more and that the team and the station were her home. As they were arguing over this, they failed to properly dress and Pruitt caught them when he came to fetch documents from the captain's office.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref> Under pressure from Pruitt, they told the team about their relationship. The team was mostly supportive but only worried about who they'd saved first in a fire. Their worries were abated when Jack and Andy said they'd ended things.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Robert Sullivan]]\nWhen they first met, Robert and Andy weren't on the best of terms, but two near-death experiences brought them together; surviving the Aid Car tumbling off a cliff<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x</ref>, and a wave of fire in California.<ref name=\":\">[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref> When they finally gave into the attraction between them, Sullivan suddenly stopped, which upset Andy, who didn't know he stopped because his leg had gone numb.<ref name=\":\" /> After a little back and forth, they finally got together and told Pruitt they were a couple over lunch. They remained in a secret relationship and even got married in a small ceremony with only Pruitt attending, as his cancer was back and he was dying. After his death, falling through a roof he was venting, Sullivan took care of his wife while she grieved her father. He told her that both his parents were dead, and Andy replied that \"we're all we have\".<ref>[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]], x</ref> When Andy returned to work and Ben confronted Sullivan about the stolen drugs from the PRT car, Sullivan was forced to confess to both Ben and Dixon about his marriage. Later that night, they confessed their relationship at a party at the station, much to the surprise of their co-workers.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, they separated for a while due to Sullivan\us status as a recovering addict. Amelia Shepherd suggested they take a -day break to help with his sobriety. Both Sullivan and Andy found it difficult to be apart, and almost slipped up more than once. Andy almost didn't attend Robert's court case regarding him stealing drugs from the PRT.<ref>[[We Are Family]], x</ref> After a discussion with his sponsor, Richard Webber, he decided to reconnect with his wife. He and Andy are seen dancing to music in the beanery and share a kiss.

Sparks fly when they have to work together, but opposites attract. They had a relationship prior to her father's diagnosis and occasionally would have sex even after they ended things until Andy got into a relationship with [[Robert Sullivan]], and later married him.\n\n\nAndy is a firefighter at [[SFD Station |Station ]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]], part of one of the best crews out there. Like all Seattle firefighters, she's also a qualified EMT.\n\nAfter her father got diagnosed with cancer, both she and [[Jack Gibson|Jack]] became the acting captains of Station , with one of them running each shift. This arrangement ended after the skyscraper fire. [[Lucas Ripley]] acted as their captain for six weeks until he picked [[Robert Sullivan]] as their new captain.\n\nFollowing the events of the Garcia house fire and protesting [[Maya Bishop|Maya's]] demotion from captain to lieutenant for insubordination, Andy was forcibly transferred to [[SFD Station |Station ]].<ref>[[Phoenix from the Flame]], x (S)</ref> She became acting captain in the wake of [[Pat Aquino|Captain Pat Aquino's]] injuries following the gas explosion.<ref>[[A House Is Not a Home]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n*Her character was the first one cast for the show.\n*She speaks Spanish.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n*She's not a hugger.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n*Her drink of choice is beer.\n*One of her hobbies is rock climbing.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n*As a kid, she used to sort her Legos by size, color, and function.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n*She and her father lived at  Field Pine Place.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n*She gets energetic when she's excited.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n*She's the lightest member of the team.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n*She likes the Spice Girls and Cardi B.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n*She was the state champion in salsa dancing.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], x (S)</ref>\n*She was on the dance squad in high school.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], x (S)</ref>\n*She had braces for four years.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n*She plays shortstop for Station 's softball team.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref>\n*She got married in a pink chiffon dress at\uacity hall.<ref>[[I'll Be Seeing You]], x (S)</ref>\n*She is scared of raccoons.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], x (S)</ref>\n*She got her first period a day before her th birthday.<ref>[[Nothing Seems the Same]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxAndyHerrera.png\nSxAndyHerrera.png\nSxAndyHerrera.png\nSxAndyHerrera.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Andy-centric or are otherwise very informative about her life.\n*[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\n*[[Stuck]]\n*[[Eulogy]]\n*[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\n*[[Bad Guy]]\n*[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\n*[[Alone in the Dark]]\n*[[When the Party's Over]]\n\n\n:'''Andy:''' My dad's always run things a certain way around here.

He is the father of [[Pruitt Arike Miller]].\n\n\n\nDean was working at a corporate job, which he described as taking money and making it into more money, when one of his work colleagues collapsed at his house and fell into the water due to a likely drug overdose. Dean pulled him out of the water and started CPR while they waited for help to arrive. Pruitt responded to the call, but Dean refused to stop CPR until Tom was successfully resuscitated. Impressed by his persistence and skill, Pruitt gave Dean his business card and said to call if he was interested in a career change.<ref>[[Born to Run]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean took in Tiffany's dog, Charlie, because her new place wasn't big on pets. Charlie ate his alarm clock, which led to him being late for work and being put on desk duty for the day. He spent the day bored until [[JJ Lau|JJ]] came in with her broken fire alarm. He fixed the alarm and sent her home.\n\nAn Aid Car was called to Lakeside Estates to free Mr. Paige, whose testicles were stuck in his shower chair.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean and Ben responded to an Aid call at The Langham. They found [[JJ Lau|JJ]] on her floor after she fell off a ladder. Her smoke alarm was still going off, so Dean broke through the ceiling and released smoke into the apartment. He picked up JJ and carried her out of her apartment.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously.\n\nWhen they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAt the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she was scared of fire. They decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Maya noticed Vic just starting at the flames and stood with her when she said it helped.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station . He sided with Jack, saying Jack was always ahead of everyone else and the patients really love him, despite having argued with Jack during the calls. Ripley asked Dean directly who he agreed with during the call, which Dean struggled to answer. He said Jack would make a great captain, so Ripley asked again and Dean admitted that Andy made the right call in his mind, even after how things went.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter being out all night with JJ, Dean came into work extremely tired. The station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out.\n\nOutside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount.\n\nWhen Jack later asked Dean what happened with the access pad, Vic covered for him and he assured her there wouldn't be a next time.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the active fire, they worked with Charlotte, who made the decision to jump through the fire to try to get to a fire door. Then there was a crash and she didn't respond. Andy jumped after her and found her injured. She used an extinguisher sphere to put out the flames and let the rest of the group come help her free Charlotte. Andy took Charlotte down to triage and because the fire was contained, she sent Jack and Dean to the floor above to check it out. On that floor, they found a large amount of combustibles. A rapid evacuation was started. Andy dropped Charlotte at triage and then went back up to the top floor to tell them to get ready for evacuation. Then she went back downstairs and helped Ripley pack up and evacuate base camp. When Jack and Dean found a civilian as they closed fire doors, they called for an elevator evacuation. Ripley said no, but Andy took the elevator key and sent the elevator up. Jack sent Dean down with the civilian and continued his work. Dean was riding down with the civilian when there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean took the civilian out and handed him off. He then said he wanted to go back in after Jack, but Ripley forbade it and said no one was to go back in. Dean spent a while tending to patients outside before grabbing a tank and sneaking back into the building against Ripley's orders. On his way up to Jack, he ran into Ben, who was tending to Molly and sent Jack up to take care of Travis. Dean stopped where Vic was taking care of Travis. He wanted to continue up to Jack, but Vic told him that Andy and Maya were getting Jack and he needed to help her with Travis instead. They got Travis out of the building and into the ambulance. At the hospital, they waited for news. Despite it being a difficult repair, Travis survived his surgery and spent the next several weeks recovering.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter an apartment fire, Andy and Dean brought [[Natalie Forrester]] to the hospital. She'd been evacuated from the building and then collapsed on the sidewalk. Andy offered to sit with her son, who was anxious, while they waited for his father to arrive. Andy and Dean then got checked out by Bailey, a new requirement by Sullivan. Dean then lingered because he had a crush on Maggie. At the end of the day, he asked her out, but she told him she had a boyfriend.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Dean was paired with Travis and didn't want to talk about his birthday.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis, Dean, and Ben responded to the call when [[Hannah Sherwood]] got her hand caught in her garbage disposal. She'd reached down there when her wedding ring had fallen in and got her hand caught. She turned it off quickly, but then decided to wait for help instead of trying to pull her hand out. Travis said he'd disconnect it and then take it apart to release her hand. While they were work, Hannah noticed that her daughter had gotten a tattoo and asked one of them to check it out to see if it was infected. Dean did and put antibiotic ointment on it. Travis was finally able to free Hannah's hand and they told her to follow up with the hospital in a few days.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy, Dean, and Maya responded to a call about a woman injured in the park. They arrived to see a confused woman on a park bench with a head wound. She couldn't remember anything about herself or how she was injured. While checking her for other injuries, Maya found a picture of a boy in her shoe. They finished checking her out and then dropped her off at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Later, they found her at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] when they were dropping off another patient. Andy went after her and got her to agree to come back to their rig. Maya and Dean went to investigate how she'd ended up there. Dean learned she was a fugitive and the cops wanted them to distract her to give them time to arrive. They learned she was [[Margaret Chen]]. Andy felt there was more going on, so she asked Margaret about it. She stole some money from her work to pay for her son's medical care. She was going to put it all back, but she got caught before she could. He was scheduled for his surgery that day and she wanted to see him before her surgery. They enlisted Ryan's help. They were able to sneak her into the hospital to see her son and then she was arrested and taken to court.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen, Dean, and Travis had planned to work together to repaint Travis's place. As they prepared to leave, Sullivan talked his way into an invitation to join them. With Sullivan there, they painted in virtual silence. When Sullivan started dancing while painting, they were disturbed, but he explained that when a month ago, you couldn't move your legs, you dance when a song comes on that makes you want to dance. The rest of them started to dance as well.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStill upset with Dean for his part in the intervention, Jack called Dean's family and set up a dinner with them.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> However, before the dinner could happen, Dean's family cancelled and Jack was trying to reschedule.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFinally, Jack was able to reschedule the dinner. Ifeya, Bill, and Yemi Miller came over. Ifeya and Bill continued to try to pressure Dean to quit firefighting and join the family business. He said he wouldn't and after Yemi, inspired by Dean, told them she wanted to move out of their house, Ifeya insisted on speaking to Dean alone. He told her about how firefighting is more than just a job to him and got her to give Yemi the same support she gave him by agreeing to go on a few dates she set up. After the dinner, Dean proclaimed Jack an honorary Miller.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his Crisis One program turned out to be a success, Dean reached out to other fire departments in an attempt to expand the program to other cities across the country. The Chief of the Oakland FD was particularly enthusiastic and made him an impressive offer to move to Oakland to help set up the program there. Dean was seriously considering the offer and reached out to Diane to inform her that he would be taking a step back from the Crisis One program. When Diane in turn reached out to Vic to nudge her towards taking up a more active role within Crisis One, Vic pieced together that Dean was leaving. He admitted that she was right.\n\nTogether with his crew, Dean responded when an entire neighborhood was destroyed by an explosion. En route, Dean spontaneously invited Vic to move with him and Pru, whom he would love to show the world. Vic was baffled, pointing out how he had thrown her out in order not to confuse Pru, and after contemplating it for a moment, she told him she couldn't accept his offer. He had figured that she wouldn't but he had to ask. At the scene, Vic was electrocuted while up on the ladder spraying down water on a fire and ended up dangling while passed out. Dean rushed up the ladder and gave her mouth-to-mouth. She regained consciousness and they got her back down to the ground.. In the medical tent, Vic then told Dean that he was her brother and that she loved him. He reciprocated the sentiment, hinting at a deeper meaning for him, and then headed back to help his colleagues. He was close to a house when it blew up due to gas having built up inside it. Jack and Ben found him and tried to resuscitate him.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x (S)</ref> \n[[File:xDeanMiller.png|thumb|Dean is pronounced dead at Grey Sloan.]]\nThey got him to Grey Sloan as soon as possible, but Dean had been down for more than  minutes by the time they arrived. They were unable to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead.<ref>[[Bottle Up and Explode!]], x</ref>\n\n\nDean is charming and passionate. He's always looking for opportunities to be a hero. He's very much aware of the effect his firefighter uniform has on the ladies and he's not afraid to use it to get a date or two.\n\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany]]\nAfter responding to a fire at Tiffany's house and rescuing her dog, Charlie, Dean had sex with her.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> He also watched Charlie for her when her new place wasn't pet-friendly.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[JJ Lau]]\nWhen JJ came in to get her smoke detector fixed, she and Dean started flirting. He later responded to a call at her apartment building, which he discovered to be on fire.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref> Dean carried JJ out of the building and kept checking on her as he evacuated the other residents. When her sometimes boyfriend Seth died as a result of the fire, she came to Dean to talk about it.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean was worried about giving JJ enough time to grieve, so he went to Travis and then Pruitt for advice on how to approach JJ. Pruitt told him just to go after JJ if he wanted her. He said to go get a new incident report because hers was damaged. When Dean said it wasn't damaged, Pruitt poured juice on it and said it was.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref> He went to do the replacement report, but she saw what he was trying to do easily. She headed him off by asking him out on a date herself. He later showed up for the date, but because he'd had a weird day, he started rambling, which she interrupted with a kiss. He then carried her back into her apartment.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean continued to enjoy his time with JJ, going to concerts and often staying out late. However, that started to affect his work when he was out all night before being on duty.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref> When Dean learned that JJ was pregnant with his child, she stayed at his apartment until she left him following the birth of their daughter as she felt overwhelmed about the responsibilities of being a mom.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nHe had a crush on Maggie. He asked her to dinner but she laughed and told him she had a boyfriend.\n\n[[Nicole|Nikki]]\nNikki went on a date with Dean that was set up by their parents. She was late to the date because of a client, but once she arrived, she suggested to Dean that they just get it over with. The conversation flowed easily, but Nikki left abruptly after thanking him for making the date painless. However, after working a shift, Dean decided to give Nikki a call as he really liked her.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ripley's funeral, the firefighters went to the bar to have drinks and celebrate his life. However, Dean realized that he'd accidentally scheduled his date with Nikki during that same time, so the others were surprised when she showed up.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter fighting the wildfire in California, Dean suggested that Jack and Maya come have brunch with him and Nikki. Nikki and Maya were both shocked to see each other as they had previously dated.<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref>\n[[Sasha Bennett]]\nSasha came into the station to get her earring removed from her hair and gave Dean her number.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x (S)</ref> She\uastarted seeing Dean after that.<ref name=\":\">[[Louder Than a Bomb]], x (S) </ref> Once the Covid- pandemic began, Sasha was willing to stay with Dean to take care of his daughter, Pru.

There was even a suggestion that she move in and assist him.. [[Diane Lewis|Dr. Diane Lewis]] called the two out on their chemistry at one point, but they insisted they were not a romantic item. Dean harbored his crush until just before he died. One of his final acts before dying was to give an unconscious Vic mouth to mouth resuscitation after she was electrocuted while the team was on the scene of a fire, which helped save her life. The attraction between them had been hinted at multiple times before this incident. Prior to the incident that resulted in his death, Dean was considering moving to Oakland, California to expand his burgeoning Crisis One program, and asked Victoria to come with him and Pru, but she refused.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nHe struggled with his parents being too involved in his life. He solved this by moving out to his own place.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref> For his th birthday, his parents sent him a watch that was engraved to say \"Lost time is never found again.\" He knew it was meant to pressure him to quit fighting fires and join the family business.

When he was in high school, he and [[David (Station )|David]]\uadressed as Dammit Janet and Dr. Frank N. Furter and went trick-or-treating. While walking, they heard a scream and saw a woman pressed against a window. Travis told David to call the cops, then shouldered his way through the door and tackled [[Chuck (Station )|Chuck]], who was beating his wife. That gave him a taste of being a hero and led to him becoming a firefighter.\n\n\nIn , he got married to Michael. When they told Travis's family they were getting married, his mom was happy but his dad wasn't. Travis asked his mom to read a poem she had written during her pregnancy with him at his wedding. Travis's dad was ashamed and asked him why he had to be so open about it. At their wedding, Travis's mom and dad didn't show up but he and Michael still got married. Afterwards, his mom read them the poem at home but Travis said it wasn't enough. In , Michael died leaving Travis to be a widower.\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya went with Travis on a medical call. They tended to [[Edith]], who had fallen and dislocated her shoulder, something that had happened before. Maya was shocked that Edith refused pain medication. Travis saw her foot shaking and asked if she had seen a doctor for it, but she said she was fine. Travis told her she needed an adjustable bed and her grandson was supposed to get her one. She said that she hadn't told her grandson about it because she didn't want him to worry. Travis later went back to check on her and her grandson was there, so he talked to the two of them together about her seeing a doctor.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop. They later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter a small e-cigarette fire, the team was later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital. At the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she was scared of fire. They decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis and Maya used torches to drill Vic, but she stopped the drills and said they weren't helping.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station . Ripley started to ask him about how he was dealing with his husband's death and how he was adjusting to being at station , but Travis said he'd rather talk about the Captain decision, the reason they were there. He said that he thought he knew who he'd pick, but after that call, he knew Andy had made the right call when Jack wouldn't have. He told Ripley that Andy thinks like a Captain.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. Outside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount. The trapped were freed when they used the water heater to cause an explosion and compromise the door just enough to give them access.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. Ben and Travis treated patients with minor burns at triage and sent them out. When Jack and Dean found combustibles on a floor above the fire, a rapid evacuation was started. In order to release the civilians from the top floor, Ripley sent Ben and Travis to clear the black smoke out of the stairwells so they could walk down. They did so, but when the fire jumped floors and broke out the windows, a flying shard of glass became impaled in Travis' chest. With the radios not working, Ben attempted to drag Travis down the stairs. On the stairs, they ran into Molly, who had been trampled by a panicked mob, leaving her gravely injured. Seemingly reconciling himself to fate, Travis urged Ben to leave him and get Molly to safety, which he reluctantly did. Travis was later found by Vic who was on her way to find someone to help Maya and Andy save Jack. She started pulling him down the stairs, where she met up with Dean, who was going to go after Jack, but Vic convinced him to stay with her and help her get Travis out. They were able to get Travis down the stairs and into an ambulance. By that point, Travis had lost so much blood that his heart stopped twice before they reached the hospital. Travis was taken into surgery, where it was discovered the glass had penetrated his heart. Initially, Vic was furious with Ben for leaving Travis, but she changed her tone after she learned Molly had died in surgery. Though the repair was difficult, Travis survived his surgery and spent the next several weeks with Grant, who helped take care of him as he recovered.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Travis came despite being on leave because he didn't want to miss the moment. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Travis helped Ben, who had been left behind at the station as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSullivan had suggested a peer group for firefighters to Travis and Vic to work out their conflict. They weren't going to go, but ultimately chose to. They were surprised to hear [[Lucas Ripley|Fire Chief Ripley]] talk about the skyscraper fire and the trauma he still experienced in the aftermath.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Travis was paired with Dean, who didn't want to talk to him about his birthday. Upon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis, Dean, and Ben responded to the call when [[Hannah Sherwood]] got her hand caught in her garbage disposal. She'd reached down there when her wedding ring had fallen in and got her hand caught. She turned it off quickly, but then decided to wait for help instead of trying to pull her hand out. Travis said he'd disconnect it and then take it apart to release her hand. While they were work, Hannah noticed that her daughter had gotten a tattoo and asked one of them to check it out to see if it was infected. Dean did and put antibiotic ointment on it. Travis was finally able to free Hannah's hand and they told her to follow up with the hospital in a few days.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him. Travis tried, but Jack left and wouldn't answer his phone.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor, where Travis was disappointed not to see any hot strangers.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter breaking up with Grant, Travis tried a revolving door of hobbies. Vic tried to support him through this, but didn't really understand the appeal. Vic also decided to tell Travis about her relationship with Ripley. He was shocked to learn she'd been hooking up with the Chief.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen, Dean, and Travis had planned to work together to repaint Travis's place. As they prepared to leave, Sullivan talked his way into an invitation to join them. With Sullivan there, they painted in virtual silence. When Sullivan started dancing while painting, they were disturbed, but he explained that when a month ago, you couldn't move your legs, you dance when a song comes on that makes you want to dance. The rest of them started to dance as well.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. After she was sent to the hospital, a broken cell phone and a secret extra propane tank caused an explosion, so they had additional difficulty stabilizing the building so it wouldn't collapse.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAs an openly gay firefighter, Travis is often hailed for being braver than most, to which he responds in modest tone. Travis is the heart of the station. He keeps everyone on track and helps his team members grow. Following the death of his firefighter husband Michael under an unexperienced Captain, Travis became stickler for following the rules and he makes sure that the newbies stay in line.\n\nHe considers himself an open book aside from a few details that he likes to keep to himself, such as his birthmarks. He has a tendency to obsess, sometimes over rather small things, which can compromise his otherwise great listening skills.\n\n\n\n[[Michael Cooper Williams|Michael Williams]] \n[[File:SxTravisMichael.png|thumb|A photograph of the married couple.]]\nTravis was married to a man named Michael Williams until Michael died on duty. He was a firefighter, too. He describes his late husband as his one true love. He told Andy he lost his husband to a captain who was too green, which made him worry about her being up for the job, because her lack of experience compared to Jack.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter his husband's death, he ordered food and had grief sex with the delivery guy to combat the loneliness.\n\n[[Grant (Station )|Grant]]\nTravis met Grant at his grandmother's retirement community.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey met again when Travis took Vic to a meditation class at the same place Grant teaches yoga. Grant gave Travis his number, but Travis didn't call. They met up again when Edith called Grant to her and called emergency services in an attempt to set the two of them up. They agreed to get breakfast, but when Grant showed up at the station the next morning, Travis admitted to Grant that while he was attracted to him, he doesn't date because he didn't want anyone to go through being widowed like he had. Grant laid out what he had planned for their first three dates and convinced Travis to agree to get breakfast for real.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nGrant made Travis eggs in a jar for breakfast, which Travis agreed was the best thing he ever tasted. While they ate, Travis advised Grant that he needed to go very slowly, to ease back into dating. Grant promised he was okay with that, that he knows when it's worth the wait. Despite Travis's words, he later went to Grant after a long day at work and kissed him.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nGrant came to the hospital when Travis was injured in the fire, but couldn't get information from the desk because he wasn't family. But he found Ben and Vic, who updated him. He was worried that Travis had lied to him about always working in pairs when he learned that Travis had been left alone. When he learned that Ben had been with him and then left him to die, he was upset. He stayed at the hospital to see how Travis came out and when Travis survived his surgery, Grant helped take care of him as he recovered, keeping a strict eye on him.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> Grant was unhappy when Travis decided he wanted to go back to work instead of taking the additional time off Grant wanted. He said he was worried he'd lose Travis, but Travis reassured him.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref> Due to Travis' injury, Travis said they skipped the early romance, including having sex for the first time. To combat this, Travis wore part of his uniform and seduced Grant.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDuring Friendsgiving, things became awkward when Greg assumed they were married after seeing Travis's ring and Grant denied it quickly and emphatically. This worried Travis, who asked Grant about it at the end of the day. Grant revealed that he didn't want to get married.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref> After the windstorm was over, Travis and Grant talked and decided to end things because they had different visions of the future.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Emmett Dixon]]\nTravis and Emmett met and hooked up. The next morning, Travis was surprised when a naked Emmett joined him in the shower, thinking he would have left already. Afterward, Travis left for work and was shocked to see that Emmett was the new probie of the station and also [[Michael Dixon|Fire Chief Dixon's]] son. After a call, Travis briefly spoke to Emmett and brought up that Emmett hadn't told him he was a firefighter. Emmett simply replied Travis hadn't asked.\n\nWhen Travis learned that Emmett was closeted and in a long-term relationship with a women, he ended things, though Emmett continued to show interest and feelings towards Travis. Eventually, Emmett ended things with his fianc\ue, came out as gay, and quit being a firefighter.\n\nAfter he left his fianc\ue, the two of them continued hooking up. However, Emmett had fallen in love with Travis, feelings Travis did not reciprocate. After Emmett admitted his feelings, Travis called it quits. After a fire and talking to some drag queens, they made him realize he didn't have an actual friend who were part of the queer community. He reached out to Emmett and asked if they could be friends. Emmett agreed and the two of them became friends. Over the course of time, Travis started to realize he had stronger feelings for Emmett. On the night of Maya and Carina's wedding, he admitted to Emmett that he really liked him. This shocked Emmett, who said he couldn't let himself be hurt by Travis again. Travis accepted the answered and started to walk away, but Emmett pulled Travis in for a kiss.<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x (S)</ref> The two ended up in bed that night, which re-started their relationship. \n\nThe two of them were in a happy relationship until Travis started to realize that he liked Emmett, but he wasn't in love with him. During a Crisis One call in which a man wanting to set himself on fire, Travis tried to build a connection with the man by admitting that he was falling out of love with his boyfriend.<ref>[[The Little Things You Do Together]], x (S)</ref> After that day, Emmett ignored Travis's attempts at communication. Travis wanted to apologize and kept asking Victoria what grand gesture to do to get Emmett to forgive him. Emmett came to the station and told him to stop.<ref>[[In My Tree]], x (S)</ref> During another Crisis One call, they found a man who had died and had not been found for over a month. Travis realized that he would rather be alone then be with someone he didn't love. However, Emmett got scared and thought that he didn't want to be alone. Travis was going to end things with Emmett, but Emmett surprised Travis by saying he forgave him, that they could forget that day.<ref>[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]], x (S)</ref> Emmett invited Travis to a dinner at his parents' house but didn't tell him it was for his father's birthday. Over the course of the night. Travis fought Michael Dixon on many topics. At the end of the night, Emmett told Travis he had applied for an opportunity in Italy to study art. He told Travis that he knew that they couldn't be together. He admitted that he was just scared of being alone like the dead guy. Travis said he really did care about Emmett before leaving.<ref>[[Alone in the Dark]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\nIn , Travis got engaged to Michael. When they told Travis's parents, they were silent on the issue and then his father left the table. As they planned the wedding, Travis asked his mother to read a poem she'd written while she was pregnant with Travis at the ceremony. She agreed, but on the day of the wedding, neither of his parents came. Michael promised to be his family and show up for him.\n\nAfter the wedding, Nari read the poem to them privately. Michael said she'd done her best, though Travis said it wasn't enough.\n\nHe was once caught skipping Sunday School, and his father gave him the silent treatment for a year.<ref>[[House Where Nobody Lives]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Victoria Hughes]]\nTwo weeks after his husband died, Travis was working at Station , where he met Victoria Hughes. They had a rocky start because she disliked him second guessing her, but Vic helped him through his grief and they bonded as Travis pushed Vic to train harder and do better.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon his return to work, Travis noticed some tension between himself and Vic. He asked her about it, but she denied anything was wrong. This later built up to a fight when she revealed that she was upset that he'd quit on life in the skyscraper. Sullivan told them to stop fighting at the station and suggested a peer support group where they could go.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis and Vic mended their relationship\uaat the support group and it was further strengthened by the fact that she later told him about her secret relationship with Chief Lucas Ripley. In Travis' own words he felt that they'd \"really come full circle\" and that he was glad to have his best friend back.\ua\n\nLater, he confided in her that he was still really hung up on Michael and she said that sounded pretty normal considering how awesome Michael was.\ua\n\nThroughout their relationship, Vic talked to Travis about Lucas and when Lucas suggested getting married for practical reasons, Travis talked her out of saying yes, because he said something real was more important than something practical.\ua\n\nWhen Lucas was in hospital and Vic had to say her final goodbyes, Travis held her hand and helped her through it. He was devastated that his best friend had to go through what he went through with Michael.\n\nOn the day of the funeral, Travis and Vic fell out as he thought she should attend because she needed to accept what had happened no matter how awful it was, but she didn't want to. She commented that Travis was still in denial over Michael. However, during Sullivan's speech about his best friend, the two shared a quick\uaheartfelt glance and appear to make up. That evening, Travis defended Vic by beating up another firefighter who said nasty things about her and Ripley's relationship at a bar.\n\nVic noticed Travis wasn't at the station and worried a little about him, but Sullivan brushed her off. Pruitt bailed Travis out of jail and went with him and Ryan Tanner to LA, where the rest of the team were fighting a wildfire.\n\nTravis helped Vic get into her bed for the first time since Lucas' death and he even managed to make her laugh.<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nTravis is close with all the firefighters at the station and he works well with everyone.\n\n\nTravis is a firefighter at [[SFD Station |Station ]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]]. By seniority, he was acting captain when lieutenants Andy Herrera and Jack Gibson were off to take their captaincy drill test.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref> He doesn't want to move up the ladder because he signed up to save lives, not to push paper around all day. \n\nAfter seeing Montgomery in action, Chief Ross suggested he tried to become a Lieutenant. He declined, saying he didn't want to be the who ordered a firefighter to the place where they got killed, plus it would take him away from the work he liked to do.\n\n\n*He is the first main character in the Grey's Anatomy universe to share a last name with another main character to whom he's not related or married, in this case with [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Montgomery]].\n*He is the first male\uaopenly gay main character in the Grey's Anatomy universe.\n*He and his husband honeymooned at a B&B.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n*He meditates.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n*He wrestled in high school.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], x (S),</ref> He wrestled all four years, three of which were on varsity.

He didn't get adopted and instead grew up in foster care. He was almost adopted into one family with two siblings in June , until their house caught fire due to an old faulty oven. Jack ran into the house and helped to save his brother but his parents didn't make it and he got separated from his brother and sister. After a while, he ended up in a group home with a lot of other kids, who became his family until he joined the Seattle Fire Department and found his family there. During his time in the group home, he had night terrors, which freaked out all the kids except one girl.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguisher, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFrankel came to the station and explained to Jack and Andy the procedure for choosing a new captain, which would take months. She said they'd alternate as captain each shift until then. Andy went first. She had the team do air consumption drills with new partners. Frankel watched for a while and then said she could stop back in anytime.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went to continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed. Back on the ground, Frankel admonished both Jack and Andy for their choices, saying Andy should have listened to Jack's experience and Jack should have followed orders.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.\n\nLater, when Jack submitted an incident report for the pool party call, Frankel talked to him about the adversity she'd faced and the respect she earned. She shared a concern that Andy had been handed things. Jack corrected her that Andy hadn't had anything handed to her and if anything, her father held her back.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lynn (Station )|Lynn]] came into the station to have her car seats installed, Pruitt pressured Jack to do it personally.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time, and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy and Jack carpooled to The Incinerator, a test to determine one's suitability to be Captain. They arrived surprised to find so many candidates and only one open spot. They were put in a group with [[Charlotte Dearborn]] and [[Cole Edmonds]] to take the test. Cole went first and expected the women to watch while he and Jack did the rescue and talked down to them. Next was Charlotte, who was cavalier about safety, though she set a record time. During Jack's turn, they put out the fire, but after multiple sweeps, they didn't find the dummy, so Jack made the decision to leave without it. On the outside, he was informed that very few people mastered that variation of the test and there was no dummy in the first place. Finally, it was Andy's turn. She emphasized them working as a team. She had them hold on to each other due to low visibility. The building started to creak as they crawled along and eventually, the roof collapsed, separating them. Cole didn't respond to her calls, so they had to find him. He was unconscious. Charlotte then called for a mayday over Andy's objections. Frankel ordered everyone out, but Andy decided to stay in and find the dummy. Jack stayed with her and they retrieved the dummy. Once they were out, Frankel berated Andy for her decision to ignore the mayday call. Ripley interrupted and said he understood Andy's call, but they have rules for a reason. It's a Captain's job to remember that. In a real call, they'd all have come out in body bags. He understood but didn't agree with, her call. On the way home, Jack said he needed to win it because he was still in it, but Andy refused to talk to him about it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDuring a shift when Andy was supposed to be Captain, Jack had to step in when Andy accompanied her father to the hospital.\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called to\uarespond.\uaJack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Jack and Ryan shook hands and each agreed that the other had done good work.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. With the fire in the house, the garage started to heat up. They searched for anything they could use to try to free themselves. They found a toolkit, which Karen used to pick the lock on the trunk of the car and retrieve a jack. They tried to use the jack to lift the garage door, but it wouldn't budge. As the temperature climbed, Ryan decided to hotwire the car and try to use it as a battering ram. Jack said it was a bad idea, but Ryan started it anyway. Andy was able to stop him before he moved the car. Jack had the idea to use the motor from the internal door to get access to the house. It didn't work and they started to wear out. When Pruitt arrived and gave Andy a pep talk, she used the last of her energy to think of a plan. She saw the water heater and decided they could use the pilot light to create an explosion. They siphoned gas from the car and rigged the water heater up to explode and propel itself through the garage door. It worked and once they were free, they were all cooled down and rehydrated.\n\nWhen Jack later asked Dean what happened with the access pad, Vic covered for him and he assured her there wouldn't be\uaa next time.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack was waiting for his final captain interview, a page came in about a skyscraper fire downtown, so Ripley said the interviews were being postponed until further notice. He then told Andy that if he didn't get captain, he was putting in for a transfer to another station.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the active fire, they worked with Charlotte, who made the decision to jump through the fire to try to get to a fire door. Then there was a crash and she didn't respond. Andy jumped after her and found her injured. She used an extinguisher sphere to put out the flames and let the rest of the group come help her free Charlotte. Andy took Charlotte down to triage and because the fire was contained, she sent Jack and Dean to the floor above to check it out. On that floor, they found a large number of combustibles. A rapid evacuation was started. Andy dropped Charlotte at triage and then went back up to the top floor to tell them to get ready for evacuation. Then she went back downstairs and helped Ripley pack up and evacuate base camp. When Jack and Dean found a civilian as they closed fire doors, they called for an elevator evacuation. Ripley said no, but Andy took the elevator key and sent the elevator up. Jack sent Dean down with the civilian and continued his work. He talked to Andy through the elevator shaft. She tried to convince him to find a way out, but he said he wasn't willing to sacrifice the lives of anyone on the team to try to save himself. She asked him to stay on the radio, which he did until it cut out a few minutes later. Then there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nJack was trapped under a pile of debris which was getting hotter and hotter. He was stuck there for so long without being able to move that his PASS device activated. He thought he was going to die. Andy and Maya went up to the floor where he was and pried open a door to get access. They then followed the sound of his PASS device to find him. They pulled the rubble off him and the three of them evacuated the building together. Outside, Andy evaluated Jack, who insisted that he was okay.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nIn order to foster cooperation between the fire department and police department, Sullivan sent Jack on a ride-along with Ryan. Ryan told Jack he wasn't allowed to leave the squad car for any reason because he was a civilian. They were on traffic duty. They first pulled over [[Vince (Home To Hold Onto)|Vince]], who was speeding to get home because he had burned himself on hot coffee and wasn't wearing pants or underwear. Jack used the megaphone to ask Vince about his burn and then advised him that he'd need medical attention and offered a police escort to the hospital. After that was complete, Ryan pulled over [[Gregory Dougal]], who was also speeding. He said he was on the way to a birthday party with his daughter, [[Lindy Dougal|Lindy]]. Ryan said he'd be right back and went back to the squad car. He immediately radioed in to say he suspected a child abduction. Jack was shocked that Ryan had figured that out based just on the traffic stop. Ryan pointed out what he'd seen and confirmed that there was an Amber alert out for Lindy, who was the subject of a custody dispute. They waited for backup, but when Gregory clearly became restless, Ryan went over to the car and calmly told him not to do what he was planning because it wouldn't end well for him. He was able to talk Gregory into surrendering. Jack sat with Lindy until her mom came. The mom thanked him, even though he tried to tell her that Ryan was actually the hero. When Jack told Ryan about that, he said he's used to it because cops aren't seen as heroes like firefighters are.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Maya was paired with Jack to teach one group, which included [[Elle Kingsley]]. They both flirted with her and spent the whole day trying to outdo each other for her affection. When Sullivan saw them laughing and felt they weren't taking it seriously, he called Maya out on it, which eventually got him sent home for the rest of the shift. At the end of the day, both Jack and Maya got Elle's number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nJack continued to have trouble sleeping and what little sleep he got was plagued by nightmares of being trapped in the skyscraper.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station, where he played poker with the others and anxiously waited for news. At the end of the day, he got into a spat with Pruitt after Pruitt expressed concern about Jack's lack of sleep. When the team returned to the station, they all sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter being called out by Pruitt for not getting Jack help, Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and they left to find Andy. Jack then quickly left the station and wouldn't answer his phone.\n\nJack went to four months of therapy three times a week. He said he felt ready to go back to work, but she said he needed to deal with whatever was still keeping him up at night. He was still not speaking to Dean because he felt like Dean had betrayed him. Maya met Jack after every single therapy session, even though he said it wasn't necessary.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nJack was finally cleared to go back to work, though he was still fighting with Dean. After months of rehab, Sullivan was also ready to go back to work. Pruitt criticized him for missing Jack's PTSD and not seeing that regular drop-ins weren't coming in anymore. This inspired Sullivan to take Ben and Jack for a wellness check on a drop-in Pruitt specifically mentioned. They went to his house and did an exam. He revealed that Sullivan was the reason he stopped checking in. His car was busted, leaving him unable to pick up his medications. Ben then heard regurgitation in his heart. He didn't want to go to the hospital, but he collapsed trying to fight them off. Sullivan distracted him with a game of chess as they worked to get him stable while they waited for an aid car. He stabilized, then checkmated Sullivan. After they sent him to the hospital, they remembered that he mentioned his car wasn't working, so they went to his garage and fixed it.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nMaya and Jack were called out to the transit tunnel for an unknown medical emergency. They arrived to learn that a subway had malfunctioned and multiple passengers were injured in a minor fall. Once they boarded the car, they started treating the injuries, which all seemed minor. One of the injured was [[Will (Crazy Train)|Will]], who didn't want to let Maya check him out, but agreed when Maya asked directly. She examined him and asked about his cough, but his father didn't know how long he'd had it. Will coughed up blood and Maya noticed that he'd been on an international flight. He'd come from Bashran, in the middle east. Maya consulted with Jack and said she believed they were dealing with a contagious illness and needed to go on lockdown. They radioed out for CDC, which confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in Bashran and said they'd be on their way. They also noted that another passenger, [[Neil]], had come in on the same flight. They talked to Will's father and explained the situation and then made an announcement to the whole car. While they were working, Maya told Jack that she believed he had lied about being fine to get back to work. The situation escalated when Neil's condition worsened and he collapsed on the floor. They put in an IV and used lidocaine to restore sinus rhythm. He stabilized, but then Will collapsed. While Maya and Jack were distracted, [[Reese]] tried to leave, but [[Kenneth]], a security guard, used a taser on him, which set off a cardiac episode. He took the heart monitor off Neil and put it on Reese, which revealed ventricular arrhythmia. They didn't have any more lidocaine to treat him, so Maya went through the Aid Car, asking the passengers to show her any medications they had. While she was working on that, Reese flatlined and Neil stopped breathing. Jack asked the passengers to help and handed out assignments. They were able to stabilize Reese but realized Will needed blood. Desperate, Jack used Harold as a donor for his own son. After a rough moment, all the patients were stable. The CDC then arrived and set up decontamination so all the passengers could leave. Jack and Maya's tests showed that they weren't infected. After being decontaminated, the two of them went back to Maya's place and had sex in her shower.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStill upset with Dean for his part in the intervention, Jack called Dean's family and set up a dinner with them.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> However, before the dinner could happen, Dean's family canceled and Jack was trying to reschedule.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFinally, Jack was able to reschedule the dinner. Ifeya, Bill, and Yemi Miller came over. Ifeya and Bill continued to try to pressure Dean to quit firefighting and join the family business. He said he wouldn't and after Yemi, inspired by Dean, told them she wanted to move out of their house, Ifeya insisted on speaking to Dean alone. He told her about how firefighting is more than just a job to him and got her to give Yemi the same support she gave him by agreeing to go on a few dates she set up. After the dinner, Dean proclaimed Jack an honorary Miller.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJack knows how to get things done and isn't usually afraid to break the rules in order to save people. Jack is caring, passionate, and energetic especially when it comes to Andy Herrera.\n\n\n\n[[Andy Herrera]]\nJack and Andy secretly began sleeping together. When she found an engagement ring while they were having sex, she freaked out. Later, when Jack lost Pruitt while they were in a fire together, Andy got angry with him. With Pruitt stepping down, Jack and Andy had to work as co-captains together, further straining the relationship.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe two continuously bickered because of their different leadership styles, but\uathey began sleeping with each other again after a while to relieve the tension and postpone the conversation they knew they needed to have. He decided that sex was not enough for him and that he wanted more, to build a home with someone. Andy said she didn't want more and that the team and the station were her home. As they were arguing over this, they failed to properly dress and Pruitt caught them when he came to fetch documents from the captain's office.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref> Under pressure from Pruitt, they told the team about their relationship. The team was mostly supportive but only worried about who they'd saved first in a fire. Their worries were abated when Jack and Andy said they'd ended things.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Elle Kingsley]]\nJack flirted with Elle at a training for police officers and spent the day competing with Maya for her affection. At the end of the day, both he and Maya got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Maya Bishop]]\nMaya and Jack first met on Maya and Andy's first day at Station . Jack jokingly asked if he could touch Maya's Olympic Gold Medal for luck, but Maya immediately refused, telling him it wasn't luck but hard work and it proved how much better she was than him. Then, Maya and Andy both agreed that Jack was \"very ew\".<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> Maya was the only person who knew about Jack and Andy's secret relationship, the latter's proposal, and their subsequent breakup. She was often antagonistic towards Jack, making smack talk about him behind his back and she had clearly sided with Andy during the captain's race.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> However, when Andy and Jack got back together, Maya didn't know and was hurt when she found out, thinking Andy had betrayed her, but the girls resolved their differences.<ref>[[Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref> Later, at the skyscraper, Maya helped Andy look for Jack.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the skyscraper and the end of Andy and Jack's relationship, Maya and Jack were often seen bickering and throwing light-hearted insults at each other. When Ripley revealed that Maya had applied to be a lieutenant, Jack told her he was ready to take her on if she tried to take his job since there could only be two lieutenants at the station. At the police training, they worked together and competed for the attention of policewoman [[Elle Kingsley]], and eventually both got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...|Do A Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> When Pruitt drew everyone's attention to Jack's PTSD, Maya participated in the intervention. However, Jack got angry at everyone and told Maya she had no chance to take his job from him. When the team went to look for Herrera and Sullivan, Pruitt as acting captain benched Jack and ordered Maya to act as temporary lieutenant. Four months after the windstorm, Maya was meeting Jack after every therapy session and showing her support, telling him he would eventually return to active duty. She also invited him to Andy's party, but he declined.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Jack were both on Aid Car during the next shift, but Maya didn't think that Jack was ready to be back to work. The two responded to the train crash which turned into an infectious disease call and even though they were arguing in the beginning, they later started working together to treat the patients. Afterwards, while waiting to be cleared, the two resolved their differences and later had sex while showering at Maya's apartment.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref> While Jack wanted to clear things up between them, Maya told him she was telling Andy about what had happened and that nothing would happen between them ever again. However, when Maya tried to tell Andy, they were interrupted by Ryan and his date.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\nLater, Maya noticed that Jack was doing the quiet thing, meaning he was angry and out of concern, she asked what happened. Jack told her that seeing Dean with his family brought up feelings about his own and he told Maya that he didn't actually know who his biological parents were. Maya tried helping him by suggesting he internet-stalk them, but he brushed her off and told her he didn't want her help. However, Maya still cared and she told him so on the rooftop of the station, adding that he was the last person she expected to care about. She then walked away, but turned around and kissed him passionately.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref> The two then continued to hook up in secret. While having beer for breakfast after shift at the houseboat, Miller asked Jack to point out why Maya would make a terrible fake girlfriend for him, but Jack simply complimented Maya, saying that \"her eyes sparkle even in the dark\", proving he also had feelings for her.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy brought up the fact that she and Jack were on good terms, Jack went to Maya and told her they needed to tell Andy, but Maya suggested they have a last secret hookup in a supply closet before telling Andy the truth. However, Andy found them and she and Maya got into a big argument about it as Andy felt humiliated.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> During overhaul at the coffee processing plant, Dean revealed that he knew about Maya and Jack as they often snuck in and out of the houseboat and Maya was eager to talk to someone about all of her feelings as Andy was still mad at her.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Ripley died, Maya was visibly sad and constantly crying and Jack tried to ask her what was going on, but Maya denied the fact that she was crying. Later, Dean used an analogy with sea anemones to explain their behavior to them why Maya was crying and the fact that Jack wasn't actually annoyed with her as well as the fact that the two didn't know how to act now that they were officially together. At the funeral, Maya held Jack's hand during Sullivan's eulogy.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the bar crash, Maya sat down with Jack and told him he is good in bed and he is a good guy. He caught on to what Maya was intending. He asked if it was because she was interested in getting promoted to captain. She neglected to answer the question. She said they should just be friends.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Inara]]\nAfter helping Inara escape from an abusive husband at a fire call, he moved Inara and her son Marcus in with Marsha.\n\n\nHis most recent foster parents got married after  months of dating.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Dean Miller]]\nJack met Dean at the fire academy. Dean helped Jack get through Hazardous Materials and Jack helped Dean get through Resource Deployment. Their friendship has remained strong.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref> During their time at the academy, they initially didn't get along and even ended up getting in a physical fight, which nearly got them kicked out.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> They ended up working together at Station  after the academy and became best friends.\n\nAfter learning that Dean lived on the water, Jack was surprised Dean had never invited him over before.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref> When Dean learned that Jack had grown up in foster care, he was upset that Jack hadn't told him before, but then asked Jack to move in with him, believing that that's what Jack wanted all along.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> After Jack moved in, Dean woke up to find Jack rearranging the furniture.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nHe became angry with Dean when Dean told Pruitt about his PTSD. This led to him not speaking to Dean for months.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref> When he finally returned to work, he spoke to Dean only to tell him that he'd called Dean's family and made them talk to him, as payback for what Dean had done.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Ryan Tanner]]\nAfter Jack went on a ride-along with Ryan, they buried the hatchet and went to Dean's after work to share a drink and hang out.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Pruitt Herrera]]\nPruitt was Jack's mentor.\n\n\nJack is a Lieutenant at [[SFD Station |Station ]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]].\n\nAfter Pruitt Herrera was diagnosed with cancer, Jack and Andy became the acting captains of Station , with one of them running each shift. This arrangement ended after the skyscraper fire. [[Lucas Ripley]] acted as their captain for six weeks until he picked [[Robert Sullivan]] as their new captain.\n\n\n*He gets quiet when he's mad.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n*He drinks pickle juice from the jar.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n*He knows American Sign Language, having had a deaf foster sister when he was .<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref>\n*He played hockey when he was a kid.<ref>[[Here It Comes Again]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nSxJackGibson.png\nSxJackGibson.png\nSxJackGibson.png\nSxJackGibson.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThe following episodes are Jack-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life:\n*[[House Where Nobody Lives]]\n*[[The Road You Didn't Take]]\n*[[Crawl Out Through the Fallout]]\n\n\n\n\n{{Jack Gibson Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Jack Gibson]]\n[[es:Jack Gibson]]\n[[de:Jack Gibson]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gibson, Jack}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:Firefighters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]\n[[Category:S Rescuees]]"}]}}}}
