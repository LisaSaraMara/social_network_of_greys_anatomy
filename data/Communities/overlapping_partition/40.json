I wasn't the brightest. But I was the best. I practiced.|'''Preston Burke'''}}\n\n'''Preston Burke''' is a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]]. He was formerly [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], but quit after leaving his fianc\uee, [[Cristina Yang]], during their wedding. After winning a Harper Avery, he founded the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]], and ran it until he gave it to Cristina.\n\n\n\nPreston grew up in Alabama, where his mother owns a restaurant.\n\nBefore going to his high school prom, he was very nervous because he didn't know how to dance. He asked his uncle, who is good at dancing, to help him. His uncle agreed and taught him a few basic moves. He stayed up nights before the prom practicing his dance moves because he wanted to impress his date. On the night of the prom, it all worked out and he didn't step on his date's feet while dancing and she said that he was a wonderful dancer.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\n\nHe completed his pre-medical studies at [[Tulane University]] where he pledged Kappa Alpha Psi and went on to graduate first in his class from [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]]. While in college, he met [[Erica Hahn]], who graduated in second place after him, beginning a rivalry between them.\n\n\nWhen he was at Mercy West fighting for a heart for Denny, he rushed to the hospital to help Denny right away. Then he got shot in the shoulder before entering the hospital. The wound caused damage to the nerves in his arm and caused him to develop a tremor. He took a long time recovering, but he eventually regained use of his arm and hand and he was able to operate again.\n\n\nPreston was in the mood for a traditional, spirited wedding, which rose conflict with Cristina. In the end, they agreed to have a spirited wedding, but only a small one. The news of the wedding was supposed to be secret, but Mark overheard Preston telling Derek, and soon everyone knew.\n\n\nAfter the wedding, Burke was nowhere to be found. When Cristina asked Derek about him, he told her Burke had handed in a letter of resignation two weeks ago.\n\n\nPreston Burke was one of the  and  applicants for the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. He was against many applicants, such as [[Erica Hahn]]. He won following his departure from Seattle Grace.\n\n\nFollowing his [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery]] win, Preston Burke sought out his next challenge. Connecting with a billionaire investor, Preston founded the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] in Zurich, Switzerland with a focus on cardiac research. As its [[Chief of Staff|chief medical officer]], Preston managed and worked in the institute for some time until he gave it to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] in order for him to move to Milan, Italy at the request of his wife.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe is a brilliant surgeon, however, he is sometimes overbearing, especially when it came to his relationship with [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]. He is extremely neat and organized, particularly when it comes to [[Burke's Old Apartment|his apartment]], which is spotless. He is an excellent cook and plays the trumpet. \n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nAt the mixer before the interns' first day, Cristina approached Burke but he ignored her and was too interested in his date.\n\nHe began a relationship with intern [[Cristina Yang]] but broke it off because he feared it would ruin both of their reputations. However, her miscarriage brought them back together. They lived together in his perfectly-kept apartment. However, after being shot he started to have tremors and they were forced to keep them secret putting a strain on their relationship. After a long time of keeping his tremors a secret, Cristina went to the Chief and confessed everything. Initially, he was engaged in a cold war with Cristina, where neither of them spoke but after she broke the silence, he proposed to her and she accepted.\n\nHowever, on the day of their wedding, Burke told Cristina that he no longer wished to make her do anything against her will, and Burke realized he was trying to make Cristina the woman he wanted her to be rather than accepting her as the woman she is. Cristina said she \"thought this was what she wanted.\" He wanted her to say she ''knew'' it was what she wanted, so he left her in the chapel. Cristina then returned to their apartment and discovered Burke had left, taking with him the things that meant something to only him (his trumpet, his Eugene Foote collection, his grandmother's picture, and his lucky scrub cap), leaving Cristina devastated. He told Derek to inform her he quit and sent his mother to collect his things.\n\nYears later, despite having moved on and created a family, Burke evidently still had feelings for Cristina, knowing full-well if he were to work with Cristina again, he would inevitably fall for her again to the point of cheating on his wife  with Cristina and ultimately \"destroy [his] marriage and [his] life\".\n\n[[Edra Burke]]\nBurke is currently married to Edra Burke, with whom he has two children: Simone and Vivianna. Edra has sacrificed her career for their family so Burke could run the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]], but in , Burke gave his job to Cristina so he and Edra could move to Milan in order to be closer to her parents.\n\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nAlthough Burke initially disliked George, he began to like him and later, George became ''his guy''. George even moved in with him for a while but was kicked out when Cristina walked around naked. Burke was friendly towards Derek for a while but he wasn't ''friends'' with him. He even befriended Addison first. After a bomb scare at the hospital they became good friends. He even chose Derek to be his best man. He was good friends with Richard Webber as well.\n\n\nDr. Preston Burke used to be the [[Attending#Department Head|head]] [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] on a salary of $ million. After completing pre-medical studies at [[Tulane University]], Burke graduated first in his class from [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]]. He completed his [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\nHe was once the interim [[Chief of Surgery|chief of surgery]] while Dr. Webber was healing from brain surgery.\n\nHe was once shot, affecting his control of his right hand. His temporary fix to this possibly long-term problem was to work together with Cristina during every one of his surgeries so that she could take over in case he might have trouble with his hand. The arrangement fell apart after Cristina, reacting to growing stress after George caught onto their secret, went to the Chief and confessed everything. The chief was quite angry at Burke telling him that many patients are at risk and it is a major problem that his hands are not able to function perfectly. The chief referred to Burke's hands as being worth  million dollars.\n\nUntil their secret was revealed, Burke was set to become the next Chief of Surgery, but now he has to compete with his fellow attendings for the position. He recovered full use of his hand after being operated on by [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]].\n\n[[Image:Preston-burke-wins-award.jpg|left|thumb|px|Burke wins a Harper Avery.]]\n\nAfter he left Cristina at the altar, Preston's long-time rival, [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Erica Hahn]], replaced him as the head of cardiothoracic surgery. She has some respect for Burke, but was infuriated when he won a [[Catherine Fox Award|medical award]] instead of her.\n\nFollowing his [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery]] win, Preston, with the help of a billionaire investor, founded the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] in Zurich, Switzerland with a focus on cardiac research.

He performed surgery to remove the pacemaker on his musical hero at Foote's request, but against Burke's better judgment.

Additionally, he was planned to perform a Whipple. Both procedures are typically performed by a general surgeon, however Burke is likely to have been certified in general surgery before completing his cardiothoracic fellowship.\n*In , Preston Burke was a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic]] [[Fellow|surgical fellow]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].<ref>[[Shake Your Groove Thing]], x</ref>\n*In the season seven episode [[Shock to the System]], a former patient of Burke is hospitalized.

She is the daughter of the now-deceased [[Ellis Grey]], a famed general surgeon, and the now-deceased [[Thatcher Grey]]. She was married to [[Derek Shepherd]] until his death; they have two daughters, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] and [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], and a son, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]]. She has won a [[Catherine Fox Award]].\n\n\n\nWhen Meredith was young, her father, [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]], would bring her to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to visit her mother, [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]], at work. As a small child, Meredith got to see her mother perform surgery. As a gift, Meredith was given an \"[[Anatomy Jane]]\" doll by her parents, which contained  parts/organs to take out, and extra parts to simulate pregnancy. Meredith would bring the doll with her to the hospital. Years later, an adult, and now a doctor, Meredith uncovered the doll while she and Derek were unpacking boxes in their house, which was previously owned and inhabited by her mother and father before their divorce, and by her mother after, until Meredith was forced to place her mother in [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]], due to Ellis suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's. The doll brought up old memories for Meredith, along with a renewed attachment to the doll that resulted in adult Meredith bringing it to work with her one day. Upon recognizing an Anatomy Jane doll and her own remembered fondness for her own as a child, [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] allowed Meredith to scrub into surgery that day on a patient being treated for an inoperable tumor. During the surgery, it was obvious that [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] was quite disturbed, and also feeling a little guilty, at the sight of the doll, as he had been reminded of a young Meredith craving her mother's attention and love, yet not getting it since Ellis was not only very focused on her surgical career but also because he and Ellis were having an affair when they were both interns and residents. \n\nMeredith's parents had a troubled marriage, though part of this was due to [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]] spending too much time working and normal everyday problems. But a large part was due to the fact that for years, Ellis had been involved in an affair with one of her colleagues and best friends, [[Richard Webber]]. Their marital issues proved too great, and eventually, [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]] left the home when Meredith was five years old. He tried to visit her on several occasions, but he got nowhere. Eventually, he stopped seeing his daughter and subsequently started a new family with his new wife, [[Susan Grey]], and had two children.\n\nWhen Thatcher left Ellis, she continued her relationship with Webber, although he still had a wife, Adele. Although Richard tried to conceal his relationship with Ellis, Adele always knew, so if she was in their company, she would just play with Meredith. Eventually, Richard broke off his relationship with Ellis, as he felt he was being the better man, by walking away from Ellis, with Meredith only meters away, riding on a carousel. Meredith vaguely remembered her mother's pregnancy with Webber's child after he broke it off. In the memory, Ellis made it clear that she did not want to even look at the child. Shortly thereafter, Ellis accepted a fellowship opportunity at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She relocated to [[Massachusetts]] with Meredith, and Thatcher lost all contact with his daughter. As an adult, her only childhood memory of Thatcher was giving her cereal in the morning.[[Image:YoungMeredith.png|thumb|left|px|[[Time Has Come Today|Meredith as a child.]]]]\n\nIn the th grade, her English class had to read ''Romeo & Juliet.'' For extra credit, their teacher Mrs. Snyder made them act out all the parts. A boy named Sal Scafarillo was chosen for Romeo, and all the girls were jealous of Meredith, who was chosen for Juliet. But Meredith was not happy, and she complained to her teacher that Juliet was an idiot because she had fallen for the one man she knew she could never have. Then she blamed fate for her own bad decision. She told her that if Juliet was stupid enough to fall for the enemy, drink a bottle of poison and go to sleep in a mausoleum, then she deserved whatever she got. Therefore, at the age of , she was very clear that love, like life, was about making choices. Meredith later described her high school years to Cristina by saying, \"I wore a lot of black. Had the whole angry pink hair thing going on. Wouldn't have been caught dead at prom.\"\n\nShe went to college at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], and despite excessive drinking and partying, she graduated. Following her graduation, Ellis suggested that Meredith find another direction in her life, not being convinced that her daughter had what it took to survive medical school and make it in the surgical world. Following an argument about Meredith's future, Meredith spent two months traveling in [[Europe]] with her best friend [[Sadie Harris]], who also hated Ellis. But during that time, Meredith's mother Ellis Grey was diagnosed with early-onset [[Medical Glossary#A|Alzheimer's disease]] and placed into a nursing home in Seattle. Ellis's diagnosis gave Meredith the push she needed to go to medical school. After graduating from medical school, Meredith moved back to Seattle from Boston and into her childhood home in order to begin her internship at Seattle Grace. Meredith was the only one who knew about her mother's condition outside the nursing home staff, whose personnel were bound by contract to keep Ellis's condition confidential. Ellis also made Meredith promise not to tell anyone.\n[[File:Anatomy Jane.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith's \"Anatomy Jane\" doll.]]\nCristina later helped \"diagnose\" Meredith as having a case of \"severe abandonment issues,\" as the cause of her relationship problems with Derek, due to the fact that Thatcher left her, when she was a child, that she had to suddenly leave her childhood home when she was five, and that Ellis was absent for most of her childhood, due to her work and the affair she was having with Richard.\n\n\nAfter having a one-night stand with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] without knowing that he was her boss, she and Derek began dating, initially discreetly. But soon Bailey, Meredith's resident, caught her and Derek together and made it her mission to make Meredith's life at work as miserable as possible, as she was involved with her boss, who was also Bailey's boss. Meredith soon learned that Derek was still married when his wife, [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]], came to Seattle to get Derek back. At first, Meredith was angry with Derek for not telling her, but she later admitted to still loving him and begged him to \"pick me, choose me, love me.\" When Addison handed him the divorce papers to end their relationship officially, Derek remained hesitant and soon after decided to stay with Addison, much to Meredith's dismay. Although the two constantly flirted and Derek still hinted at having feelings for her, they both agreed to remain friends, and Addison, too, attempted to be friends with Meredith.\n\nWhen Derek's best friend, [[Mark Sloan]], visited Seattle, he was quick to realize that Meredith was \"the one\" for Derek and tried to persuade Addison to stop fighting for her marriage as Meredith was Derek's, true love. Meanwhile, Meredith rescued a dog, [[Doc]], in an effort to move on, but after her housemates, Izzie Stevens and George, gave her an ultimatum to choose them or Doc, she gave the dog to Derek and Addison. Doc was taken to the vet and diagnosed with bone cancer. Meredith started to date Finn the vet, much to Derek's annoyance. Meredith dating Finn also caused Derek to end the friendship with Meredith and call her a whore.\n\nOn the night of the Seattle Grace Hospital Prom, Derek went with Addison, while Meredith went with Finn. The two soon after met with each other in an exam room where Derek confessed that he still loved her and they had sex. Addison discovered Meredith's underwear in Derek's pocket and the two finally agreed to divorce. Meredith, however, was still dating Finn and issued a contest between the two boys to see which she would settle with. She ultimately chose Derek and they reconciled. \n\n\n[[File:xDrowningmeredith.jpg|thumb|xpx|Derek saves Meredith from almost drowning in Elliot Bay.]]\nMeredith, Izzie, George, Alex, and Bailey went to the site of a massive [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] accident. After Meredith finished stabilizing a patient's badly wounded leg with the help of a little girl just by the water, the man panicked and pushed Meredith off the edge into the bay. Later, when Derek was shown Meredith's fate by the little girl, he jumped into the water and then retrieved a pale, seemingly lifeless Meredith. He tried to perform CPR in the ambulance, but she did not respond. The doctors all tried to revive her, but she flatlined. Then Meredith entered a state of limbo in her mind, where she interacted with deceased acquaintances like [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny]], [[Dylan Young]], [[Doc]], [[Bonnie Crasnoff]], [[Elizabeth Fallon|Liz Fallon]], and her own mother, [[Ellis Grey]]. Eventually, she left this state of limbo and came back to life slowly. Meredith recovered, but Derek remained concerned that Meredith was a good swimmer, and that perhaps she had not tried hard enough and had given up.<ref>[[Walk on Water]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen one of Derek's patients, [[Jen Harmon]], found out that Derek was going to propose to Meredith, the two started to become friends and she wanted to help with the proposal. When she died, Derek blamed himself for her death. He ended up quitting his job and he moved back into his trailer. Richard told Meredith later that day that Derek was going to propose to her. Later that night, Meredith went to the trailer to find Derek drunk and hitting empty beer cans into the woods with a baseball bat. They started to argue and Meredith said, \"I know there's a ring!\" Derek froze. Meredith then told him that the chief had told her about the ring and that she was not going to give up on them. Derek then hit the ring into the woods. The next time Meredith went to see Derek at the trailer, she told him Izzie had metastatic melanoma and that it spread to her liver, skin, and brain. And that he was the most qualified surgeon to remove the tumor. Derek later asked Meredith to marry him, but she rejected his proposal. Derek ended up going back to work and removed Izzie's brain tumor successfully. That night, Derek proposed to Meredith in the elevator, which was decorated with surgical scans from their past cases. This time, Meredith accepted.<ref>[[Elevator Love Letter]], x</ref> Izzie Stevens began to plan the wedding, but right before, Derek and Meredith decided to give the wedding to her and Alex Karev.<ref>[[What a Difference a Day Makes]], x</ref> Later, Derek and Meredith got married in the resident's lounge, on a blue Post-It note from Cristina Yang.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Meredith was treating a John Doe, who soon would be identified as [[George O'Malley]], he attempted to write on a pad before surgery but wasn't successful. While recovering in the ICU, he attempted again to write on Meredith's hand, and she soon realized that it was George after he traced \"\" on her hand multiple times. Meredith was alarmed and alerted the other doctors, who originally believed her when he was taken in for brain surgery. During George's brain surgery, his brain swelled and he was declared brain dead. Lexie thought it wasn't George because she didn't think he was tall enough, so Callie checked for a Texas-shaped birthmark on his hand, which she saw, confirming it was George.\n\n\nDuring the start of the merger with Mercy West Medical Center, Meredith was hospitalized from having donated a portion of her liver to her father, Thatcher Grey, since he was unable to be placed on the transplant list due to his alcoholism.<ref>[[Tainted Obligation]], x</ref> Richard's drinking escalated again, causing him to make an error during surgery which almost killed a patient, until Dr. Bailey stepped in, fixing the problem<ref>[[New History]], x</ref> and scheduling weekly followups with the patient to ensure he had no lasting effects.<ref>[[Blink]], x</ref> Richard's alcoholism led him to do one-on-one teaching sessions where he showed Meredith various surgical techniques and she discovered his drinking again.<ref>[[Holidaze]], x</ref> She kept this from Derek, but he became very angry with Meredith and made her tell him what was going on.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref> When Derek found out about the drinking, he reported Richard to the board, forcing him to either step down from surgery and go to rehab or retire. When he chose rehab, Derek was named the interim Chief of Surgery.<ref>[[State of Love and Trust]], x</ref>\n\n\nNear the end of their third year of residency, Meredith revealed to Cristina that she was pregnant. She also planned on telling Derek, but the mass shooting intervened. The husband of a deceased patient, [[Gary Clark]], entered the hospital and shot many people, killing many, including [[Reed Adamson|Dr. Reed Adamson]] and [[Charles Percy|Dr. Charles Percy]]. The hospital was placed in lockdown while the shooting occurred. Gary Clark also shot Derek in the chest while Meredith watched from afar. Cristina had to do his surgery herself after barring Meredith from the OR. When the shooter entered the OR, Meredith entered too and told him to shoot her. However, he ended up shooting Owen, though his injuries were comparatively minor. While tending to Owen's injury, Meredith suffered a miscarriage.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the shooting, all involved were made to go through a psych consult to be cleared for surgery. Meredith was the last one to be cleared. She was cleared by Dr. Andrew Perkins only after she admitted her pregnancy and miscarriage.\n\nDerek began speeding to cope with the trauma and was arrested several times for \"reckless endangerment.\" The only people that knew about Meredith's miscarriage were Cristina, Owen, and April. Meredith ended up leaving him in jail on the night of Cristina and Owen's wedding. The next day, angered at having been left in jail overnight, Derek had an argument with Meredith in the hospital hallway. Derek tried to calm Meredith down and Meredith admitted that she had been worried about him since he started speeding and the only time she got relief was when he was in jail because she knew he was safe. She then told him about her miscarriage. Derek and Meredith kissed and hugged, and Derek agreed to drive more carefully from that point on.\n\n\nThe couple had recently been told that Meredith had a hostile uterus and conceiving a child would be difficult. Meredith and Derek met Zola when she was brought to the hospital for a spina bifida operation as part of Alex's program. Derek immediately bonded with Zola and suggested adoption. Meredith took a little longer to bond with Zola, but eventually, she was unable to avoid falling in love with the child. However, Derek found out that Meredith had tampered with his Alzheimer's trial just as the couple was granted temporary custody of Zola. When the social worker on their case, Janet, discovered that Meredith and Derek weren't living together and that Meredith had been fired, red flags were raised in the system. Fearing that she would lose Zola, Meredith hid with Zola in the basement of the hospital for  hours. Zola was taken away from them for a time, during which Meredith and Derek rekindled their relationship. They were given a date to see a judge about the adoption after Alex went to the judge directly. That date was subsequently canceled and Janet told them that it was unlikely that it would end in their favor and suggested that they move on. But the decision did end in their favor, and Janet brought Zola to them, finalizing the adoption.\n\n\nAt the end of her residency, Meredith, along with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], was involved in a plane crash on the way to Boise to help in a conjoined twins case. Lexie died due to a part of the plane crushing her, and Meredith was horrified and mourned. The plane crash also led to Mark's death, Arizona's loss of her leg, and Derek's severely damaged nerves in his hand.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nThe group ended up spending four days out in the woods before they were found and airlifted to [[Boise Memorial Hospital]], where they were treated before being sedated and flown back to Seattle.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nAll the survivors of the plane crash filed a lawsuit against the plane company. Their attorney informed the survivors that they would be pursuing action against the hospital instead of the plane company since the hospital put them on the plane. This alarmed the doctors. However, they decided to go ahead with the lawsuit, because Derek went to see the plane wreckage and believed if they settled, they wouldn't properly investigate what went wrong so it couldn't happen again to someone else.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors went to trial and were awarded $ million each. Callie decided that their win should be celebrated, and Meredith, Derek, Callie, Arizona, and Cristina all went to dinner to celebrate, where Meredith revealed that she was pregnant.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\nDuring Meredith's pregnancy, [[Alana Cahill|Dr. Alana Cahill]] was brought to the hospital to assess efficiency, as the plane crash verdict forced the hospital into bankruptcy after its insurance refused to pay the penalties after finding a loophole.<ref>[[Walking on a Dream]], x</ref> The doctors learned that Dr. Cahill was planning to clean up the hospital so that it could be sold to a company called Pegasus Horizons. But Richard and Callie conducted additional research of the company and learned that it would be a terrible asset to the hospital.<ref>[[The Face of Change]], x</ref> They brought the survivors together for a secret meeting and discussed purchasing the hospital so they could maintain the hospital in which all the doctors had been trained and which they still loved.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors went to investors looking for a partner to come up with enough money to purchase the hospital. After exhausting all their other investment options, they eventually were given $ million by the Harper Avery Foundation to purchase the hospital. The Harper Avery Foundation, led by [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]], made Jackson Avery their spokesperson on the board,<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref> which upset all the other doctors. They, however, all resolved the conflict when Jackson tried to bring the board together by proposing the hospital be renamed to reflect their beliefs and reasoning behind purchasing the hospital in the first place. This resulted in Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital being renamed to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in , after Lexie Grey and Mark Sloan, the two fatalities of the plane crash.<ref>[[Transplant Wasteland]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite Derek's warnings to slow down, a heavily pregnant Meredith couldn't keep from joining in on a surgery at the beginning of the superstorm. However, Meredith was forced to leave when there was a risk of explosions in the OR. She talked to [[Alex Karev|Alex]] about beating up [[Jason Myers]], only to find out that [[Jo Wilson|Jo]] was the one who had beaten up Jason. She followed Jo into a staircase, where Jo promised she would never let Alex take the fall for what happened to Jason. As Jo left, a construction worker told Meredith that they were done with the grinder in the OR. \"Then why aren't I up there?\" she angrily asked, and as she ran up the stairs, she slipped and rolled down the stairs. She sent Derek a message and got checked out by [[Connie Ryan]], and she promised that everything was fine with the baby. While the surgeons were preparing the hospital and the storm hit Seattle, Meredith's water broke.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was admitted but had to wait for Connie, who was busy with other soon-to-be mothers. Cristina, who found it typical for Meredith to go in labor during a superstorm, stayed by her side while Derek went to look for Connie. He found her, but as she did a check-up on Meredith, she told them that there was face presentation. As she mentioned that a C-section was necessary to deliver the baby safely, the lights went out and the back-up generators failed to engage. Even though they were, at first, hesitant to perform surgery in the dark, they realized there were no other options. The surgery went well, and Derek took his newborn son to the NICU to make sure everything was fine. While closing up, Connie got called away for another mother in need, and she and Meredith trusted Shane to close up. However, Heather and Shane discovered heavy bleeding, and Meredith realized that she had suffered an internal bleed from her fall on the stairs. Before losing consciousness, Meredith instructed Shane, who had found out that her spleen was bleeding, how to stop the bleed. Meanwhile, Heather went to find Dr. Bailey to assist them. Bailey overcame her fear to operate and pulled Meredith through. Meredith was kept in the OR until she was stable and later moved to a room in the maternity ward, where Derek and Zola visited her and their new family member.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a board meeting in her room, the others informed Meredith what had happened during the superstorm. She tried to help out as much as she could, but Derek and the others told her to rest after her major abdominal surgery. While the others left, Cristina stayed behind to chat a little until she got paged. Though it was said at the meeting that the ER had to close, Meredith got confused when she witnessed Stephanie and Jo exchanging supplies to use in the ER. When a stressed Alex entered her room, Meredith managed to calm him down by letting him hold her son. He told her about Richard and Heather, and he gave the baby back to her so she herself could recover her own calm. Meanwhile, Cristina and Bailey started arguing over the course of treatment for Richard, only to find out that Richard had listed Meredith as his medical proxy, which in turn had forced her to choose between Cristina and Bailey's plans. She decided to do so by relying on science and asked to rerun some tests. While waiting for the results, Callie sat down in her room to have a little chat about how she was doing. When Richard's results came back, Meredith decided to side with Bailey and allowed her to operate, which Cristina had advised not to be done. While Bailey operated on Richard, Meredith asked Cristina to admit that the decision was right, and Cristina did.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith later talked with Cristina and Alex about Richard's decision to make her his medical proxy, wondering if she was in his will too. After Richard's surgery, Owen came to Meredith's room to tell her that Bailey had closed Richard back up once [[Catherine Fox|Catherine]] started yelling at them from the gallery. Meredith also consoled a sad Derek, who had lost Heather in surgery. After Meredith ordered Derek to go home with Zola, who had spent enough time in daycare now, Callie and Sofia came in to drop off some things. Callie told them that she had moved out of the apartment and that they would stay at a hotel for a while. Meredith decided to let Callie stay at their house, and she later told Arizona, who had no idea where Callie and Sofia were, that they were at her house. While trying to fall asleep, the interns bothered her to ask for help finding Heather stories to tell Heather's mother, and Meredith told them what she had told George's mother after he died. When the interns left, Jackson came in to tell her that his mother was planning on moving Richard to another hospital. Alex and April came in too to talk about their problems, and as they left one by one, they all refused to bring her a wheelchair. However, she somehow got herself a wheelchair and went to Richard's room in the ICU with Bailey. Bailey still thought that they should open him back up, and Meredith made the call to book an OR for Bailey. Later, back in her room, Cristina and Alex talked with Meredith about medical proxies, and it turned out that Cristina had actually disapproved of Meredith's decision for Richard. After Bailey's surgery, Catherine still wanted to have a second opinion. Meredith told her that Richard chose her to make his decisions, and not Catherine. They started arguing as Richard opened his eyes, and Meredith enthusiastically greeted him.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite his promise to Meredith to take care of the kids so that she could have a year to focus on her work, Derek started to consult on a time-consuming brain mapping project for the White House. The presidential team asked him to become more involved in the project, but he initially refused the offer in an attempt to keep his promise to Meredith. While at April and Matthew's wedding, Derek received a call from the president himself and ended up accepting the offer to put his name on their federal research initiative.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\nThis caused Meredith to become upset with him since she had wanted to continue with her own research work. Derek later learned that the federal team wanted him to run the project's advisory board. While on a trip to Washington, D.C., Derek was offered a full-time job at the National Institutes of Health, and he found a job for Meredith at James Madison Hospital.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Meredith later told Derek that she refused to leave Seattle after Cristina reminded her not to let what Derek wanted eclipse what she needed. Forced to choose between his family and the brain mapping job, Derek decided to stay in Seattle as well and rejected the offer.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, there was excessive tension between Meredith and Derek. Derek was unsatisfied with his job at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, especially because his sister Amelia had taken over as head of the neurosurgery department.\n\nMeredith was upset with Derek for being so attached to the federal initiative position and told him that she never wanted him to give it up for her. [[Deborah Curzon]], a special assistant to the president, came to Seattle in a last attempt to recruit Derek for their team. Derek told her that he was unfortunately unable to accept the offer, but he took her card anyway. Later that day, he got into a fight with Meredith, who told him to take the job in D.C. and leave. Derek called the woman he had spoken to earlier and told her that he did want the job after all.<ref>[[Risk]], x</ref>\n\nHe packed some clothes and went to the airport while Meredith threw away the Post-it note that had signified their marriage. The next day, Meredith and Derek talked on the phone and decided that they can make their relationship work, even if Derek had to take the job with the president. She then took the Post-it note out of the garbage and hung it back up on the wall. After a couple of weeks of Derek in D.C., he came home to Meredith and said that he thought D.C. was everything, but he was wrong. Derek told her that her, Zola and Bailey were everything. Derek told her that he couldn\ut live without her. Meredith replied that she could live without him but that she didn\ut ever want to. The two then hugged and made up. Derek moved back home.\n\nWhen Derek moved back home after being in D.C. the two were lying in bed and Derek told her that she was always the one. He told her that she truly did save him. He also told her that he wanted more with her. Meredith then went to work telling friends that she was happier than ever with her husband and children.\n\nWhen Derek was leaving to hand in his resignation to the White House, he told Meredith to stay and wait for him, just like when he left her at the house of candles so he could break up with Rose. Meredith and Derek kissed and he left. A couple of hours later, Meredith got a call that Derek never showed up for the meeting in Washington D.C.. Meredith soon began to worry about what happened to him. Just as she picked up the phone to call the police, the police came to the house asking if it was the home of Derek Shepherd. She replied yes that\us my husband. Meredith then was told there was an accident.\n\n\n[[File:Meredithsayinggoodbyetoderek.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith says her last goodbye to Derek.]]\nDerek was involved in a car accident with serious injuries. Ultimately, he was declared brain dead, and Meredith had his ventilators turned off. He had been on the way to the airport for a final trip to D.C. where he would wrap up his work and hand in his resignation. After Derek died, Meredith took Zola and Bailey and left Seattle in the middle of the night, much like her mother did with her when she was a child. All Meredith left was a note saying that she and the children were safe. Her friends tried to contact her repeatedly, but she didn't answer. It was later revealed that she moved to San Diego for one year. Finally, Meredith answered on Thanksgiving, telling Alex to stop calling her, that she and the kids were fine.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith put out feelers with a real estate agent to see whether anyone would be interested to buy her house. But she forgot to inform Amelia, which sparked a fight between the two. Amelia was mad at her for not having called her before pulling the plug on Derek, so she couldn't say goodbye. Meredith broke down after the confrontation. She later went to Alex and explained that her house didn't feel like her home without Derek, so she asked if she and the kids could stay with him and Jo for a while. He agreed to that,<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref> but Jo got mad at him for not consulting her first. Meredith felt guilty about forgetting that Amelia was also supposed to be her sister, and gave her her old phone with Derek's last voice mail message. Later that day, she intervened when Catherine and Richard were too angry to get married. Meredith played the dead husband card and got them to the altar after all. That evening, Meredith hosted a party for the newlyweds at her house. At the party, she told Maggie, who was upset about her own parents' divorce, that she could always come to talk to her, about anything. Amelia joined them as Meredith said that a house filled with happy people would be the perfect last memory, as that had been what Derek had wanted. She took Amelia and Maggie's hands and they went inside to dance it out together.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\nAs Jo found a loft for the two of them, Alex moved out of the house and sold it back to Meredith, who moved in with her kids and sisters. The sister started carpooling to work, and Meredith started to teach an intern anatomy class at the hospital. Initially, there were some tensions among Meredith and Amelia, including an argument over whether or not they were going to tear down the wall between the kitchen and the living room, as a drunk Meredith had mused about. Maggie intervened to call a truce. Meredith and Amelia apologized to each other, and Meredith admitted she doesn't know how to talk to Amelia as she's a lot to handle sometimes, and Meredith doesn't totally like her. However, she considered Amelia family, so she didn't have to. She then decided it was okay to tear the wall down.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a busy day where Bailey, the new Chief, dumped all her patients on Meredith, Bailey rewarded Meredith with a promotion to Head of General Surgery.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref> However, Bailey made Meredith an offer with a low salary. After consulting with other department heads, Meredith stood up for herself and asked for the salary she deemed fit. It turned out that Bailey was actually testing her to see if she would stand up for herself and agreed to Meredith's request.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen [[Nathan Riggs]] arrived at the hospital, it did not take long for Meredith to discover the reasons regarding his feud with Owen. Out of loyalty, Meredith asked Owen if they hated Nathan, to which Owen said yes.\n\nThe day Owen sold Derek's trailer, Meredith witnessed Amelia being happy in her new life with Derek's job and a possible engagement to Cristina's former husband. This all resulted in a particularly bad day for Meredith, resulting in her snapping at everyone in the OR, including Nathan. Alex later told her not to crap on everyone's life just because she was choosing to be unhappy and pointed out she had choices. Later that night in the parking lot, Nathan brought up her behavior and that he understood the way she felt about living a life without Derek, comparing it to Megan's disappearance. Things got heated and resulted in her kissing him, which led to them hooking up in her car four times in one night.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Owen and Amelia's wedding, Meredith and Alex talked about possibly having only one true love in your life. At work, Meredith made it clear to Nathan that she didn't want him to get too attached, which he assured her he wasn't.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie confesses her crush on Nathan.]]\nShe then went to the church to get Amelia down the aisle, which included a quick getaway and more debating about having one true love. Meredith concluded it would be better if you believed you can have more than one. This led her to open up to Nathan shortly before the ceremony when they discussed her wedding and his wedding plans with Megan. During the ceremony, Nathan gave Meredith a loving look. However, Maggie misinterpreted his look as being for her, and she confessed to Meredith that she had a crush on Nathan, leaving Meredith in an awkward situation.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nAt the wedding reception, Nathan invited her to dance but she declined. As he was suggesting they get out together, Maggie interrupted and ended up dancing with Nathan. Meredith continued to avoid Nathan after Maggie's confession and told him they had a problem. Before she could elaborate, Jo called her about Alex assaulting Andrew. She went to the hospital to check on Andrew's status and, knowing what really happened, kept Alex updated on Andrew while lying to Maggie about what had happened to Andrew. She and Ben both knew that Alex was the culprit, but she kept protecting Alex to make sure his good side would win. She learned the truth about DeLuca being with Jo through Stephanie and went to tell Alex, who had thought that DeLuca was raping a drunk Jo. She advised Alex to go and tell Bailey what happened, but he went to try and stop Andrew from pressing charges.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Nathan supports Meredith.]]\nNathan found her sitting in a lounge and sat with her at her request as she decided to tell Bailey the truth. She did so, but Alex turned himself in before Bailey could have him arrested. Maggie was upset when she learned that Meredith had lied to her. Meredith said she just did so because they were still figuring things out and promised not to lie to her anymore, like a real sister. However, she immediately broke that promise when she hid the fact that Nathan came to see her that night, asking about the problem she had mentioned as he really felt something between them. She replied someone would get hurt and, since Nathan brushed it off, then lied and said she didn't feel the same way about him.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie later told her about her recurring sexual dreams about Nathan and decided to ask him out like a grown woman ready for her big love. Meredith then accompanied Alex to the courthouse, where he was charged with felony assault in the second degree. This made Alex think of himself as just another piece of trash but Meredith reminded him of his career and remained confident that he wouldn't go to prison. In surgery with Maggie, Owen came in to invite Meredith for a housewarming, and Maggie volunteered to come after finding out Nathan would be there. Meredith later rode an elevator with Andrew and talked about how she was assaulted and forgave the man who did that to her. She added he should be focused on surgery instead of the case, which he interpreted as a threat.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith at the dinner party.]]\nMeredith arrived at the dinner party and she made Owen give Maggie a tour so she could have a private talk with Nathan. She told him Maggie was going to ask him out and she asked Nathan to decline nicely, which Nathan took as a signal that Meredith herself felt something for him, which she denied. At the party, she also asked Jo to talk to Alex even though Jo was more concerned about Andrew. Later at the hospital, Bailey confronted Meredith about her threat to Andrew and warned Meredith not to go down with Alex, but Meredith insisted on standing by him. She and Bailey then had to operate on Alex's patient following a mistake he made, and Meredith invited Andrew to scrub in to clear the air between them. Back at home, Alex told Meredith about Bailey's decision to let him work in the clinic and that he supported that decision because his head wasn't in the game. Meredith then told him about her sleeping with Nathan, just before Maggie came in and told them Nathan turned her down. However, she didn't plan on giving up since he just told her he wasn't dating right now.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey and Catherine brought [[Eliza Minnick]] to be the new Residency Program Director, effectively firing Richard from the job. When Meredith refused to allow Eliza into her OR to observe her teaching technique, Bailey suspended her. Bailey came to her house to get her to come back to her job. She agreed to come back if Richard could return to the Residency Program Director. Bailey declined and Meredith didn't come to work. Richard came over to Meredith's house to get her to come back and said she'd be fine.\n\n\nEventually, Meredith finally agreed to dinner with Nathan, but their plans were postponed when Maggie's mother died and Meredith had to take care of her.<ref>[[Be Still, My Soul]], x</ref> She found herself on an airplane with Nathan, as both were heading to a conference. They ended up hooking up in the airplane bathroom. Both had to tend to patients when the plane hit turbulence. The experience allowed them both to become closer and for Meredith to open up to Nathan about her history. She agreed to stay in a hotel room with Nathan, marking another step in their relationship.<ref>[[In the Air Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs the relationship with Nathan progressed to him sleeping over a lot, Meredith finally found it time for him to meet the kids and invited him to dinner. After doing so, she started to panic a bit, but Amelia pointed out there was nothing or no one standing in her way. However, as she came home after work and told her kids about the upcoming guest, her plans were thwarted when Amelia told her that Megan had been found and was on her way to Seattle. Upon finding out that Nathan didn't know yet, Meredith immediately left to go and tell him. As she arrived at the hospital, she witnessed an explosion from the parking lot.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> Meredith rushed inside and started to help out with evacuating patients due to the spreading fire, all the while looking for Nathan. She also went looking for [[Erin Miller]], a missing girl. While looking for Erin on the OR floor, she found that Nathan had refused to evacuate and was still working on his lobectomy patient. She quickly got gowned and gloved to help him so they'd be out faster. As soon as they could, they left and took the patient to the evac zone outside. He had inhaled some smoke and needed oxygen therapy. Meredith stayed with him and checked his breath sounds. In that quiet moment, she recalled their shared dream of their lost loved one returning to them and finally told him the news about Megan. He broke down and she confronted him, unable to answer his questions about Megan. She could only tell him that Megan would be brought to Madigan Medical Center. He decided to drive up there and could hardly contain his excitement and happiness, something she told him he did not need to apologize for as she understood how he felt. She then told him to get going and watched him drive off.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith talks to Megan before the surgery.]]\nMeredith was at work when Owen and Nathan brought Megan to the hospital. She had a frozen abdomen and Meredith had an idea of how they could reverse her colostomy. While Bailey and Webber advised a conservative approach, but Megan opted for the more radical approach so she could return to her son in Iraq faster. Nathan had doubts about Meredith working on the case given their history, but Meredith assured him she could do it. Megan tried to find out from her who Nathan had been dating, but Meredith didn't answer. [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] also urged her to tell Megan the full story. As she advised Alex to tell Jo that he had found her husband, she realized it was only right Megan also got the full story and went to tell her, only moments before Nathan came in to do so. As she prepped Megan for surgery, she shared that her one great love had died and that she'd do everything to get Megan back to her son, which was Megan's first priority. Meredith nervously scrubbed in for the surgery, which went well right up to the end, when she found out there wasn't enough tissue left to close the wound, angering her.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nShe took her anger out by destroying the attending's lounge and went home, where she was inspired to perform an abdominal wall transplant. She got Teddy on her side and they presented the plan to Megan, who accepted the opportunity to escape her hospital bed and didn't have a problem with Meredith doing the surgery. She had Richard's sub-interns set out to find a donor since UNOS had none available. When she received news they had found one, she went to tell Megan, accidentally interrupting Nathan's proposing to her. Meredith, Teddy, and Jo then performed the surgery without a hitch. Megan recovered well. On her way out, Meredith found Nathan sitting outside on a bench. He told her Megan was still convinced he was in love with Meredith, who was angered and walked off.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\nMeredith did not want to be in another love triangle and believed that Nathan was betraying her by not seizing the miraculous opportunity to be with Megan again. Eventually, with all of Meredith's pushing, Nathan started a new life with Megan in Los Angeles with her son, [[Farouk Shami Hunt|Farouk]].\n\nBecause of her groundbreaking procedure on Megan, Meredith landed the cover of the Journal of Surgical Advancement (JSA) and won a [[Catherine Fox Award]]. She also began a series of ALPPS procedures - a first for any doctor on the West Coast.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref> For Jackson's surgery competition, she submitted a proposal for a mini-liver procedure but was unable to get the patent from her mother's former friend, [[Marie Cerone]], who still held a grudge over her and Ellis' fight. Eventually, Meredith was able to develop the procedure with the help of Jo. She also later broke the hospital's record for the single longest surgery.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith starts treating matchmaker Cece.]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew kissed Meredith while drunk, which he immediately apologized for. While she dismissed at as no big deal, the kiss led to her having sex dreams about the majority of men in her life, such as Andrew, Jackson, and Tom. Soon after, she started treating [[Cece Colvin]], a professional matchmaker, who picked up on Meredith's desire to be kissed, even though Meredith dismissed the observation. She threw her hat in the ring for the recent job opening for interim Chief to have extra work to distract her from her desires. Cece had to be put on dialysis awaiting her kidney transplant. Throughout the set-up, she pointed out that there's no cap on happiness and that love doesn't just come walking through the door. After the surgery, Meredith briefly met [[Atticus Lincoln]] but dismissed him at his attempt to introduce himself. At night in bed, a curious Meredith googled Cece's services but opted against using them.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nWhile the sex dreams continued, Meredith found herself avoiding Cece due to her aggressive matchmaking attempts. Jackson advised her to tell Cece she was married to her work, which she heavily objected to, causing Link to overhear that she wasn't married. In another attempt to find more work, Meredith set out to convince Bailey to allow her to create a surgical innovation fellowship for Jo. Later, she ran into Link and he properly introduced himself. She defended her earlier comment and stated she just meant she had a life outside work. He proposed drinks after work, but she had to assist Maggie in inserting a pacemaker for Cece's heart. During the procedure, Maggie also encouraged her to hire Cece. They later had to inform her that her client, whom she had hit after passing out in her car, had died, Cece opposed being put on the transplant list. Bailey then found Meredith and told her she had stolen Meredith's idea and created the fellowship for Jo under her own leadership. She needed some joy and found that was the way to do it, so she told Meredith to go find joy herself. After finding out she had been passed over as interim Chief, which went to Alex instead, Meredith decided to hire Cece. She admitted to Cece that she was, in fact, married to her work but didn't want to be. Having found a new purpose, Cece accepted her as a client and they started talking.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nAfterward, Meredith got tired of the flood of questions soon and did her best to avoid them. Cece tried to get answers through [[Taryn Helm]], but Meredith only closed herself off even more. She confided in Alex, who told her that after everything she had been through, she had earned the right to close herself off and be selective of whom she wanted to let it. While Meredith found a new way to continue Cece's care, she and Cece agreed to diminish the number of questions and try a new approach as well. She instructed Meredith to go out and buy herself five new outfits and ready herself for something new, which she did.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nCece planned a blind date for Meredith, who briefly came into work beforehand wearing make-up, which was noticed by several men, including Andrew and Link. She met with the guy at a restaurant for lunch having low expectations, but they really hit it off and [[John (Character)|John]] completely understood her dedication to her work. Along the way, they discovered they were actually on the wrong date but decided to keep it going. They left the restaurant and took a stroll. While discussing traveling, John stated that he was happy not having kids that could restrict his travel plans. He even went on to say he hated how desperate single mothers are in the dating scene. Having lost all interest due to his comment, Meredith revealed she had three children of her own and left the date.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andy makes Meredith realize there are positive things to take away from her date.]]\nAt the hospital, she shared her experience with [[Andy Herrera]], who made her see that she now knew there still were great men out there and that she managed to dodge this particular slow-moving bullet because he revealed his opinion on single mothers before the relationship could have dragged on for too long.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nThe blind dates continued. Before a date with [[Daniel (Flowers Grow Out of My Grave)|Daniel]], Meredith was told by Richard that [[Thatcher Grey|her father]] was dying of acute myeloid leukemia. She didn't know what to do about the situation. Link approached her for dinner, but she turned him down as she viewed him as more of an emergency kind of person rather than serious dating potential. In surgery, she and Alex discussed her situation with her father. She opened the door by giving him a piece of her liver, but he never walked through. She wouldn't need to grieve him since he had been a ghost for years. On her date, Meredith rambled on about how it shouldn't be children's job to forgive their parents just because they are their parents. She decided not to reach out since the sole purpose would be making Thatcher feel better, which she didn't think weighed up against the pain it would cause her and her kids. She returned to the hospital, where Link put his number in her phone in case of an emergency. At the same time, Andrew came over to ask Meredith about her date. She said she scared him off. Both Link and Andrew then held the elevator doors for her, causing her to take the stairs. After work, she went to hang at Alex and Jo's with Link, whose hair she cut after he had cut off a piece to comfort a kid facing cancer treatment.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was flown out to Los Angeles with [[Tom Koracick]] by [[Catherine Fox]], who needed their expertise. She revealed she had a spinal tumor. They did extra tests and found it was a grade III chondrosarcoma. Catherine struggled with how to tell Richard. Unbeknownst to her, Meredith received a call from Richard to tell her he had been arrested and was in jail.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Seattle, Meredith bailed out Richard as a windstorm hit Seattle. Back at the hospital, she and Andrew treated a deteriorating Cece, who had discovered Link and suggested him to Meredith. Concerned over Catherine's health, Meredith was dismissive of Maggie's relationship troubles with Jackson. Meredith eventually broke HIPAA and told Maggie about Catherine's cancer. At the same time, Taryn arrived with the news that they had finally found a donor for Cece. Andrew clarified to Cece that there was a very real chance she would not make it off the table alive, but Cece was willing to roll the dice. She did warn Meredith she would come back to haunt her if she didn't do her best to squeeze all possible joy out of her life. This convinced Meredith to say yes to drinks with Link, much to Andrew's dismay. He then sought out Meredith as she was preparing for the transplant and told her that he had fallen in love with her since their kiss and that he wanted her to know that he was an option. While she had some excuses to turn him away, such as her being his attending and his history with Maggie, he thought she felt the attraction between them, too. Overcome by desire, she removed herself from the situation and promised him she'd think about what he had said. Soon after, they got stuck together in an elevator on their way to the OR due to a power outage caused by the storm.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith bond while stuck in an elevator.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith decides not to choose between the two men pursuing her just yet.]]\nWith no cell phone connection, they tried to find a way out to no avail. She asked him to stop looking at her the way he did. He likened their situation to Doctor Who's TARDIS, where the rules don't apply, but she told him the rules still applied. While in there, Andrew confided in her about how his famous surgeon father killed four people while he operated in a manic episode but he got away with it because of his connections. Meredith then decided to try the trap door and he lifted her up but to no avail. As he lowered her down, she dropped into his arms and they almost shared a kiss until the power kicked back in. Finally free, they rushed to the OR. Unfortunately, Cece didn't make it. Meredith closed her up and told her about her interest in both Link and Andrew. Thanks to Cece, she had found happiness again. Afterward, Andrew showed some of his appealing cocky side and asked Meredith out on a date, with Link coming over at the exact moment with the same question. Unable to choose, she decided to go home to her children.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nThe attraction between Meredith and Andrew continued to grow with every surgery did they together. At the same time, she found herself irritated by Link's laid-back attitude. She questioned why Jo ever thought they would be good together and didn't try to hide her disdain from Link. A difference of opinion over a shared patient led to a confrontation in the OR. She wondered why he had kept his reasoning for his non-standard approach from her, to which he replied that convincing her that he belonged here was not a part of his job.\n\nLater, he found out that The Hulk had canceled for [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey's]] superhero birthday party. He offered to help out and they managed to get her house ready in time. He explained he offered to help out because she seemed stressed. He shared he does not believe in letting stress ruin your life after half of his hospital friends died from a cancer he survived and because his parents split up over it. Finally understanding the origins of his laid-back nature, she apologized for the way she behaved. He didn't mind as he liked the chase. The kids then arrived for the party and Link played along with Bailey. They sat down with cake and wine and he complimented her on running a three-kid household all the while winning surgical awards. As she admitted she had grown to like him more over the course of the day, they continued to talk over cake and wine while she ignored Andrew's text asking her to come over to celebrate his first solo surgery.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith reconnects with her dying father.]]\nFollowing Richard's urging, Meredith decided she did want to say goodbye to her father before it was too late. She went to visit him and discovered he had moved to Zimbabwe after Lexie's death. The realization he had yet again left her behind hurt her deeply, but he revealed he had actually come back for Derek's funeral. However, he saw how lost she was and decided not to bother her any further one of the most difficult days of her life. Conversation then came easier and Meredith told him about Maggie and her children and comforted him until he died with her by his side.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Jo and Alex invited Meredith for their classy NYE party. Andrew came over to ask Meredith out for drinks. She declined as she had to go put her kids to bed, but she did invite him to come to the party with her. Link, dressed as Santa, came over to give Meredith cookies from his bag while on his way to the peds ward. Jo mocked Meredith's love triangle, but Meredith stated there was no love and thus no triangle. Afterward, Andrew asked Meredith when she was going to stop stringing Link along as he was growing tired of wasting time not being with her. She assured him NYE was an actual date between them. However, she stayed at the hospital, thus standing up both Link and Andrew at the party.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew confronts Meredith about her behavior.]]\nLater at work, Andrew confronted Meredith over her standing him up and stated it was just rude of her. As time went on, he witnessed her convincing her patient's husband not to give up, he wondered how she could tell the man that if she herself kept running away from love. He thought she was so beyond him, but it turns out she was just a kid hiding behind excuses. To spite him, Meredith turned around and asked Link out to dinner. He was surprised since it was Valentine's Day but gladly accepted. Later that day, Meredith officiated a wedding between her patient and her fianc\ue shortly before the former's death. Afterward, Andrew took Meredith to the hospital roof for a spontaneous date with champagne. She stayed with him and they ended up sharing their first kiss while Link waited for her at the restaurant.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith apologized to Link for standing him up. She also held off on going on a real date with Andrew because she wanted to make sure Maggie was okay with it. While awaiting the date, Andrew kept staring at her longingly so Meredith set a rule that he could not do that at work so at to not be distracted from her work. After successfully operating on [[Kimberly Thompson|a woman from Maggie's past]] together, Maggie was finally ready to hear her out. While surprised, she was fine with it, so Meredith then went to find Andrew and took him out on a date to a restaurant. He agreed but insisted it'd be his treat.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew lets Meredith sleep.]]\nFollowing their date, Andrew assisted her as she broke the hospital's longest surgery record with a  hour and -minute surgery. Afterward, an exhausted Meredith fell asleep on a gurney in a hallway, so Andrew moved her to a bed in an empty room and covered her with a blanket.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith plan to leave soon for a night to themselves.]]\nOn the day of Jackson's party to celebrate Catherine surviving her surgery, Meredith told Chief Karev about her relationship with Andrew. He mocked her and also told her to report it to HR. She took Andrew to the party with her as her plus one, though they did not plan on staying long as Meredith had the house to herself. However, their plans were disrupted when Amelia had a fight with Owen and planned on sleeping at the house. Andrew then took Meredith into a guest room at Jackson's and they started making out there, only to be caught by Richard. To calm herself and \"act normal\", Meredith took Andrew into the kitchen and took over preparing egg rolls from the catering staff, inadvertently putting a plastic tray in the oven, which led to the penthouse being evacuated right before the big celebratory speech. Andrew and Meredith then decided to go to his place, but their plans were once again disrupted, this time by the return of [[Carina DeLuca]] with [[Vincenzo DeLuca]], Andrew's father.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew asks Meredith to trust his judgment on his father.]]\nVincenzo came to Seattle to pitch research on gestational sacks, while Meredith had a dream about her mother that steered her towards finding a specific new research project, though she had yet to figure out what exactly it was. While she spent the day in a lab trying to find an answer, Andrew visited and told her that his father seemed stable despite Carina's claims that he was bipolar. At the same time, Maggie publicly revealed her biological parentage to the medical community, which Meredith was fine with. Meredith talked about Vincenzo with Alex and advised him to dig deeper before agreeing to fund the research, but hid her knowledge about his mental illness so as to not break Andrew's trust. She later came across the arguing DeLuca siblings in a hallway. Carina wanted to shut the research down, but Andrew had signed on, insisting their father was stable. While Meredith herself remained on the fence, Andrew asked her to trust his judgment on this. At the end of the day, Meredith concluded her research had to be about non-invasive diagnostic tools.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew spent all his time on his father's research while Meredith gave him the space to do so. While her bad feeling about the project persisted, she decided to just be supportive of Andrew. In the end, Vincenzo's display of reckless behavior led to Alex shutting the research down. Meredith found Andrew clearing out the lab and he requested some time alone, so she told him to let her know if he needed anything and left him be.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith works on her research while Andrew ignores her.]]\nAndrew continued to shut Meredith out, so she focused her time and energy on her ingestible diagnostic device research. He later sent her a text to come over, which she did. She told him she was past the point in her life where she would sit around at work wondering if her boyfriend was ignoring her. He knew that, but he just needed some time to be hurt over his father and he did not want to drag her down with him. To make up for his behavior, he made her an apology dinner.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith assisted Jackson, Catherine, Owen, and [[Megan Hunt]] on a complex surgery involving an abdominal wall transplant and a penis and scrotum transplant, Richard gave Andrew a solo lap appy under his supervision. Meredith spent the day worrying about Andrew, but he passed Richard's test with flying colors despite the surgery turning into a complicated procedure. Richard told her that Andrew was a good man and Andrew later talked her through his day over dinner at his place.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nThe relationship continued to evolve but Meredith never let him sleep over since she didn't want her kids to meet him before she had told them about him. However, one night, Andrew ran into Zola while sneaking out, thus disrupting Meredith's plan on how to tell her kids. At work, Meredith and Andrew's patient turned out to be in labor instead of having an obstruction. Meredith asked Bailey for advice on how to tell her kids. After watching Andrew take care of the newborn baby, Meredith decided to gather her kids that night. Over ice cream, she told them that Andrew was her boyfriend and that he would be visiting more, but that she was not going anywhere, following Bailey's advice.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith's happy life continued for a short while until she joined Alex and Andrew on [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabriella Rivera's]] case. Gabby and her mother had been detained at the Mexican border. Gabby was reunited with her father after three months while her mother was still in the detention center. Since she was given little to no medical care, Luis had no clue what was going on with her. A scan revealed an obstruction that eventually led to her needing surgery. Unable to pay for it, Luis applied for state coverage but he earned too much cleaning office buildings to qualify. With Gabby's condition worsening, Meredith promised she had a plan. She secretly put her daughter Ellis's name on the paperwork, which alarmed Richard. He yelled at her for what she did, but she insisted that the system was broken and that they could debate her actions later. She then headed into surgery. Pathology revealed that the obstruction was caused by lymphoma, meaning they were looking at years of treatment and follow-up.\n\nAfter the surgery, Richard pointed out that Meredith was risking losing her license and a prison sentence for committing a felony and that implicating Luis in insurance fraud wouldn't help his asylum. He then suggested that they make Gabby sicker on paper so they could keep her in the hospital for  days, after which a new state policy would automatically kick in regardless of Luis' income. They rolled with it and assured Luis he could sleep in Gabby's room every night so they would not have to be separated again. Meredith assumed that Andrew was judging her for her actions, but he revealed he was actually in awe of her and hadn't spoken out because he was afraid he would tell her that he loved her. Taken by surprise, Meredith barely responded to his confession and left.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nUpon finding out that Jo still hadn't spoken to Alex after her return from Pittsburgh, Meredith went to stay with Jo while Alex took her place in her household. Jo shut her out and said Meredith was only there to hide from her own life. Meredith admitted that Andrew's \"I love you\" terrified her because it reminded her of Derek and all the pain she had been through. She then said she understood pain from deep experience and that her parents had messed with her head, like Alex's had, so they would both understand whatever had happened in Pittsburgh. Jo then revealed that her mother was raped by her father and that she looked like him. Jo then opened up about how all the terrible things in her life were just her birthright, but Meredith quipped with good things that Jo had been a part of. To get through to her, Meredith talked about how she stopped fighting when she was about to drown and asked if Jo wanted to stop fighting, too, or if she just needed a few more days under her covers. Jo replied the latter, after which Meredith insisted they go talk to Alex and Bailey to get her a proper leave of absence so she could get the help she needed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Trapped, Meredith fails to stop Andrew from taking the fall for her.]]\nWhile Jo waited to talk to Bailey, she asked Meredith to go and tell Alex. Meredith joined him in the hyperbaric chamber with [[Gus Carter]], while unbeknownst to her, her insurance fraud had come to light and Andrew was being questioned by Bailey, Catherine, and representatives from the insurance company. Soon after, Andrew came by with Catherine to say goodbye; he claimed that he had committed the fraud and apologized to her. Meredith wanted to stop him from taking the fall, but she couldn't stop him from taking the fall and turning himself in as she could not leave the chamber.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nUnwilling to explain the whole situation to the technicians through the phone to stop Andrew, Meredith had no choice but to focus on Gus and Alex. She told him about Jo's depression and what had caused it. After finding out about what Andrew did, Richard dropped by. Meredith asked him to set the record straight as Andrew's career would not survive this. He pointed out her children wouldn't recover if she were locked up, but she planned on hiring a great lawyer and plead her case, confident that her track record and the fact that it was her first offense would help her win. As Gus coded, the decompression process was started. She and Alex pulled Gus through and she rushed off.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith informs Bailey and Catherine on what she did.]]\nShe went to set the record straight with Bailey and Catherine. Alex and Richard came to her defense, but Bailey fired all three of them. Having made her mind up, Meredith went home to tell her kids that she would have to leave for a while to go take care of something. She then went to visit Andrew in jail and told him he needed to let her clean up her own messes and develop some self-preservation skills. She stood by her decision. She told him she loved him and left to set the record straight.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nShe immediately went to her attorney. Much to her surprise, she was told that she could go home. The lawyer would schedule a hearing, where she suspected Meredith would be ordered to a few hours of community service in a clinic if she was repentant. Additionally, she deemed it highly unlikely that the medical board would pursue action her license. A week later, the hearing took place and Meredith explained to the judge that Gabriela's cancer meant too many procedures and money to pay for herself or cover it pro bono. She stated the system should have supported the Riveras and that it was broken. She honestly said she only regretted her decisions to the extent she could knowing that they led to Gabriela doing well now. The judge got angry and the lawyer blurted out her three kids as a reason to keep her out of jail. She was then ordered to community service but picking up trash on the streets instead of at a clinic.\n\nWhile picking up trash, she started to give out medical advice when other people in her group found out she was a doctor. After a few weeks, Suzie Wilson, Zola's classroom mom, passed by and recognized her. Thinking she was volunteering, Suzie said she finally understood why Meredith never volunteered at school. Meredith explained working mothers don't have time for that, after which her supervisor shouted at her, revealing that she was actually there per court order. Suzie spread the word at school, which was overheard by Zola, who come home to ask her how to spell criminal. While enjoying some ice cream with Andrew, Meredith told him she was happy both she and the kids were healthy and that she actually found some sense of accomplishment in picking up trash. She then received a letter from the medical board to inform her they were, in fact, pursuing action against her license.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShe started disguising herself better to avoid getting recognized again. One morning, she found out her hearing about her license was scheduled three months later. Taking advantage of still having her license, she continued to give out medical advice to people on her crew, referring them to Pac-North for further care. She also had Levi bring her supplies from Grey Sloan, which she thought of as hers since she still owned the hospital. Her supervisor [[Robin (Season )|Robin]] started to object to her street clinic since it was keeping people from doing their work but Meredith brought up she had noticed a nodule in Robin's neck that warranted a closer look. Robin had seen her primary care physician about it, who referred her to an ENT, but her appointment was still months away. After convincing her that detecting possible cancer was more important than staying at work for two more hours, Meredith took her to the Grey Sloan parking lot for an ultrasound. Given the features shown on there, she convinced Jackson to take the time to perform a biopsy, which revealed papillary thyroid cancer, which could be treated. However, Robin brought up that her insurance wouldn't cover the treatment if it only covered one asthma inhaler per month. Jackson said they would look into options for her, which Robin said would boil down to bankruptcy or death. Meredith was then discovered in the hospital by Bailey but she stated she was just visiting a friend. That night at home, Meredith shared that continuously seeing people being let down by the medical system had made her decide to write about what she was seeing despite her lawyer advising her to lay low.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nShe got in touch with a website that would publish her story and shared some titles she had thought of with Andrew, all of them insulting to the medical system. She didn't care about her standing with the medical community since they were in a fight already anyway. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Meredith's patient [[Shirley Gregory]] was refusing to let Jo operate on her despite her being a student of Meredith's. Jo then had Bailey agree to have Meredith supervise the procedure remotely through video chat, which convinced Shirley to consent. Meredith used Robin owing her to follow the entire procedure through but Bailey hung up on her as soon as the procedure was over, leaving Meredith to go take care of a beehive in a discarded toilet. Link and Amelia came over to hang out with her and Andrew at the house. Amelia shared she was pregnant. Meredith congratulated her, excited about becoming an aunt.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWithout her knowledge, the website combined all her suggested topics into one article entitled \"Hospital Hell at Grey Sloan Memorial: Fired Surgeon Speaks Out.\" Including sharp comments about insurance companies, Big Pharma, and institutionalized discrimination, the article started trending online. She realized the article would terrify people and keep patients away from Grey Sloan. She also figured Bailey would hate her even more, which Andrew confirmed as soon as he got to work. Meredith attempted to set the record straight with the website but they refused to delete the article or even change the headline because of the popularity it had gained. Meredith quickly finished her assigned zone at community service and asked her [[Supervisor Lisa|supervisor]] to be allowed to leave to take care of an emergency. Her supervisor told her that she would inform the judge of all her extracurriculars if she left before putting in the required hours. After Meredith learned even Cristina had learned about the article, she promised Lisa she would make up the hours and begged her not to call the judge, after which she took off. At the hospital, after Jo confirmed that Bailey was furious at her, Meredith went to see her and told her that she had nothing to do with the article as all the things she had written herself were not directed at the hospital. She offered to write a retraction but Bailey said they never get read. Meredith stressed she loved the hospital and how sorry she was but Bailey said the damage had been done and asked her to leave.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith defends her choices to Andrew.]]\nOn her way out, she ran into Andrew and told him what had gone down and that she had gotten a summons to go back to court because she had walked out on community service. Andrew hated that she made a choice that could land her in jail and added to the possibility of her losing her license. He wished she would have done the community service and come back to work to change the system from within, but she said nothing she had written was untrue and that she wasn't going to sit on her mountain of privilege leaving others to fight for themselves in the broken system that was hurting and killing them. She added that if he really expected her to sit back and nothing, he didn't know her at all, and walked away from him.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nHer skipping out on community service gave her nightmares. On the day of her court hearing, she woke up to Zola telling her she wasn't feeling well. When Zola vomited during breakfast, a worried Meredith took her to the hospital and asked Tom for a head CT given Zola's history of spina bifida. While waiting for the CT, her lawyer reminded her she needed to be in court but the scans revealed Zola's shunt needed to be revised. Andrew tried to convince her to go to court while he'd look out for Zola but Meredith made it clear there was no way she would leave her daughter. Tom made Meredith wait in the waiting area so she made Taryn promise to text her updates. Andrew offered to sit with her but she didn't like him offering to skip a surgery to be her human tissue. Maggie and Amelia came to sit with her and Meredith vented her frustration about Andrew, who just didn't get her because he wasn't a parent himself. She said Andrew was sexy and fun but she wasn't sure if he was more than that or if she even wanted him to be. She then asked Maggie and Amelia to talk about their lives to distract her. Meredith grew increasingly worried despite Taryn's reassuring texts. As she was about to head to the OR, Zola's surgical team came by to tell everything had gone fine. Meredith ordered Andrew to stay by Zola's side in post-op. Later that night, Meredith headed out to get Zola some Jello. She ran into Andrew, who had anticipated the request and had found her a cup. Her lawyer then appeared and Meredith explained why she hadn't shown up for the hearing. Nancy told her she squeezed a drop of humanity out of the judge, which meant she'd have to make up the lost hours in jail.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith went to jail. On Halloween, she woke up with her roommate [[Paula (Season )|Paula]] hovering over her face because Meredith had been snoring. Since she was supposed to be let out that day and was eager to spend the holiday with her kids, Meredith watched the clock closely. When the time came, she addressed a guard, who told her that, as per usual, a crucial document for her release hadn't arrived one time but that it would show up soon. Meredith tried to bribe the guard by offering medical advice to any sick family members but it didn't work. Paula then learned she was a doctor and wondered what she did to end up in jail. Meredith told her about her crime, which was still threatening her medical license. Paula wasn't impressed with her small problems and told her how she had landed there. She was still waiting for her hearing but couldn't post bail so she was stuck in jail until the hearing, which would most likely be another month. Meanwhile, her kids were placed in the foster system. Meredith helped her out with a puzzle and commented that she was strong for not letting herself go crazy with worry over her kids. The guard came to let Meredith out and they wished each other good luck. The officer told Meredith to keep fighting the good fight without landing herself in jail. Meredith then asked the man for a favor. She went home and greeted her kids. She told her sisters she had come to realize she had a lot to work with even if she were to lose her license. She then called her lawyer and made arrangements to pay Paula's bail so she could be reunited with her kids.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nHaving made up for the hours, Meredith went back to doing community service. She ran into Amelia on her way out one day and advised her to tell Owen about the pregnancy. Meredith was working near Pac-North and decided to have coffee with Alex during her break. While in line at the coffee cart, she ran into Amelia and Maggie who told her about their problems.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of her hearing, Meredith drove to the hotel with her sisters, Alex, and Andrew. While waiting to enter the room of the hearing, Meredith waited with most of Grey Sloan's attendings, including Bailey. Upon entering the room, Nancy asked Meredith to keep quiet for once given the vicious prosecutor and let her do her job. Meredith promised she would.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith learns Paul Castello is on the panel.]]\nThe hearing began and the judge introduced the doctors on the panel. [[Paul Castello]] came in late and Meredith immediately recognized him as the doctor who had killed Derek, while he didn't seem to remember her at all. Meredith quietly explained the situation to Nancy but upon learning that the hearing would have to be rescheduled, which could take six months, Meredith decided to power through with Paul on the panel. Bailey took the stand first and denied Nancy's suggestions of her and Meredith being close. She stated Meredith no longer held the qualities that had prompted Bailey to appoint her Head of General Surgery. Afterward, the prosecutor presented her with a list of questionable events Meredith had been involved in, all of which Bailey confirmed to be true. Afterward, Luis Rivera testified that Meredith had saved his daughter and that there should be more doctors like her. Andrew was mostly questioned about their relationship, which he assured them was completely consensual and that Meredith had not pressured him to keep the fraud quiet when he discovered it. He was also confronted with his request for a transfer, which detailed Meredith's and other attendings' abuse of him after he pressed charges against Alex for assaulting him. Andrew assured the panel that that had been cleared up and left in the past. He apologized to Meredith, who said it was okay. Levi began testifying about Meredith being an amazing teacher but he was soon forced to confess that he had been the one who had reported the fraud to Bailey. He broke down and ran out after his testimony. During the recess that followed, Meredith told Andrew that their relationship wouldn't survive if her license were taken away.\n\nAfter the recess, Owen testified to her surgical skills, specifically on Megan's case, but the prosecutor had dug up Bailey's post-op notes, which mentioned Owen voicing serious doubts about Meredith's approach at the time. Richard was questioned about the Alzheimer trial but he maintained that he was the only one who had played a role in that. The prosecutor commented on the pattern of his bending the rules for Meredith and called [[Patricia Murphy]] to the stand. She shared that Meredith hadn't been matched to Seattle Grace at first until Richard reached out to the NRMP to make a personal recommendation, which landed Meredith her spot. Meredith was shocked upon hearing this. Alex testified about Meredith making him a better person and surgeon. He was asked about the delay in Zola's adoption. He kept her kidnapping of Zola quiet and said delays happen all the time. The prosecutor suspected it had something to do with Meredith's being fired. Alex hesitated to answer. Paul then began pressing him to answer, asking if Meredith's insubordinate behavior had almost cost her her daughter. Meredith shot up and told him that he had no right to talk about her daughter as he had been the one to kill her father as he neglected to do even basic burr holes, let alone a head CT. Meredith yelled that he didn't deserve to judge her or anyone for that matter, after which he had a sudden seizure. She was among the doctors who rushed to his aid. She briefed the paramedics when they arrived and stressed that they should get him a head CT. \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Gabby is among the patients who showed up to show their support for Meredith.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey re-hires Meredith to work at Grey Sloan.]]\nAfter another recess, the judge announced that the hearing would be postponed given the situation. Alex, however, objected and let in a large group of people, all of whom had been treated by Meredith. [[Ray Ford]], [[Shirley Gregory]], [[Robin (Season )|Robin]], and [[Katie Bryce]] all testified that Meredith had saved their lives. Alex then read a letter from Cristina, which stated that taking Meredith's license meant signing death certificates of countless future patients and that Meredith was an unstoppable light in a broken system. Alex wanted to proceed with letters from Callie, Arizona, April, and even Addison, but the judge had heard enough. He asked to clear the room but Bailey had something more to say. She stated Meredith had in fact broken the law to save a life, so she deserved to pick up trash, but she did not deserve to have her license taken over it. Bailey stated Meredith was too good of a surgeon for that and that everything she had survived made her better instead of cold or hard. Everyone then had to clear the room. Meredith waited outside until Nancy came to deliver the news that the majority of the panel had voted to drop the entire thing, meaning she got to keep her license. Meredith briefly hugged Andrew and was then flooded with hugs from her other friends. As they all left the hotel, Bailey told Meredith she could return to work at Grey Sloan. Meredith accepted the offer and hugged her.\n\nAt home, she ran into Jackson as Maggie was throwing him out. Shortly after, Andrew arrived. He wanted to talk. She apologized for what she had said about their relationship. He knew she had meant it. He pointed out everything he had done for her with the whole insurance fraud situation, which he said was what you do for your partner. However, he had come to realize that unlike him, she did not truly see him as her partner. While she was talking about Derek in that hearing, he realized that she didn't respect him like she did Derek. Meredith told him she respected him, too, but he insisted some part of her was wondering if he would ever be her equal. He told her to take some time to think about her future and if she wanted him to be a part of that.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn her first day back, Meredith snuck into work to do two lap appies before breakfast to ease back in. Cristina also had sent her a package to congratulate her but it was nowhere to be found. The resident presented her with a welcome back cake. Andrew didn't know she was coming back. She said she had wanted to tell him but he was too busy dumping her. He said he hadn't dumped her but it was all the same to her. While rounding on [[Jamie Caldwell]], [[Cormac Hayes|Dr. Cormac Hayes]] abruptly interrupted and introduced himself as the new head of peds. He sidelined Meredith and had Andrew present the case again. Scans revealed a mass. Cormac suspected a tumor but Meredith suggested it may be leftover gallstones from the gallbladder removal she had performed a few years back. She didn't want to worry Jamie and her mother about cancer until a biopsy had confirmed it. Cormac went behind her back and told them anyway. Meredith stepped in and assured them nothing was certain yet. During surgery, the biopsy results came in, revealing the mass was not malignant. She went to take it out. Cormac objected but Meredith shut him down by saying he was a guest in her house. It turned out Meredith had been right with her guess.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith learns that Cristina sent her Cormac as a present.]]\nIn post-op, Jamie didn't care about the successful surgery as her crush still hadn't texted her back. Cormac stepped in and said that raising boys himself had taught him that boys are just terrified of talking to girls, so it didn't mean that he wasn't interested in her at all. While leaving work, Meredith ended up on an elevator with Cormac and asked him if it was his thing to scare people at first and then bask in the relief with them later. He told her he just preferred to give people all the information and let them figure out what to do with it, a courtesy that his wife's doctors hadn't shown him before she did. He told her they would have to learn how to live together in her house. As he stepped off, Cristina finally informed Meredith her package wasn't a thing but a person: Cormac, whom she had nicknamed McWidow. Meredith then stared after him, not noticing Andrew who had been planning to set the record straight.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith went to complain about Cormac to Alex and Jo, only to find that Alex was in Iowa and that Jo had brought home a baby from her Safe Haven volunteer work. Link pointed out Jo had kidnapped a baby but Meredith understood why she had taken the baby for the night. They barely had time to catch up before the three of them were paged to the hospital for multiple traumas after a car crashed into Joe's bar. Meredith called in Owen and Richard to help out. After checking that Andrew was okay, Meredith began treating [[Taryn Helm]]. While she implanted an IVC filter, an inebriated Taryn confessed that she was in love with Meredith. Meredith didn't really react to save her from further embarrassment. She wanted to return to the ER with Levi, who collapses. Meredith did a full workup and diagnosed cardiomyopathy. She paged Teddy, who did an angio while Meredith sat by his head. Meredith assured Levi that she had forgiven him for reporting the insurance fraud. Afterward, Meredith briefly talked with Cormac. Jo saw them and commented she could see something between them. Richard then asked her to come. He told her Bailey had had a miscarriage and needed some comforting. They got a box of doughnuts and sat down with her in her office so she wouldn't feel lonely.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith texted Cristina to get more info on Cormac but Cristina stayed mum. Cormac came into the lounge to get coffee and after he was gone, Amelia commented on his being hot. Meredith then went to find Andrew and told him that she didn't like his telling her to take time to think. He told her about his patient who was inexplicably having fevers three days after a routine appendectomy. Meredith said she'd think on it but advised him to also tell Bailey. Before leaving, she told him she was missing him. He reminded her that he hadn't dumped her so she didn't have to miss him. En route to the ER, Meredith asked Cormac about Cristina, though he didn't realize whom she was talking about. While waiting on the scans of their shared patients, he asked her not to hold their first meeting against him as it was around the time he had lost his wife two years earlier. She understood and assured him it would get better over time, though not all the way better. They disagreed over approaches and had to convert to his when hers failed. He didn't hold it against her as he had had the same disagreement with Cristina once, though he was on Meredith's side back then. He then realized Meredith had brought up Cristina earlier but she made an excuse and left without divulging any further information about their connection. She went to Andrew, who still hadn't figured out what was wrong with his patient, and asked him to talk her through the entire case.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThat led them to reconcile to some degree. They spent the night together. In the morning, he received word that his patient [[Suzanne Britland]] was being moved to the CCU. While getting dressed, he said they should talk about their relationship soon and revealed he had lured diagnostician [[Lauren Riley]] from UCSF to the hospital using Meredith's name before rushing out. At work, Meredith encountered Cormac as he was giving his boys a tour of the hospital. She ran into Amelia, who had seen Andrew leave the house and wondered if they were back together. Meredith said it was just sex at this point. Later, Lauren approached her, and Meredith wrongly addressed her as the consult from UCLA, making Lauren realize that Andrew had lied. On her way to consult on Levi's patient, she ran into Cormac, whose boys had ditched him in an attempt to make them late for the parent-teacher conferences. He was in awe of her staying sane while combining her job and raising her three kids, though she admitted to dropping some balls here and there. Meredith had to tell Levi's patient that her cancer had metastasized beyond the point of treatment. She came to see how Levi set up a dance floor in the cafeteria for the patient and her husband, which made her reflect on how she used to be the kind of person who did romantic things like that. Now, she broke up with Andrew after her trial and just woke up happy to get to practice medicine the next day without giving the break-up much thought. Bailey told her that it was part of growing up. Jackson then came in to inform them that Richard was refusing to work at Grey Sloan on Catherine's terms. The three of them threatened to quit if Tom didn't rehire Richard and Owen on their terms. Tom complied.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and Carina share their concerns over Andrew's mental health.]]\nMeredith started to put together a pro bono surgery day. As she was recruiting Cormac to operate, Andrew interrupted the conversation to inquire about a past patient of hers who had developed a post-op rash similar to Suzanne's, whom they had taken off all her meds so more indicative symptoms could manifest. Meredith talked him through the case and noticed that he was speaking fast and apparently had not slept for days. She confronted Lauren's about her treating Andrew like a machine but Lauren pointed out she was counting on it, with Suzanne's life hanging in the balance. Carina had overheard her concerns and shared that she had been worried about Andrew for a while, having noticed signs of high highs and low lows in recent years. Meredith was on the fence if his dedication was mania or healthy obsession but Carina pointed out she wouldn't ask that question about a resident she didn't love. Meredith then took her concerns to Bailey, who put Meredith on Suzanne's case to approve every step.\n\nOut of nowhere, as Meredith was checking on Suzanne, Andrew and Lauren rushed in with the diagnosis of Still's disease and Andrew injected her with high-dose steroids without any explanation. Meredith pointed out he could have taken a minute to explain his actions before administrating steroids, which could kill her if they were wrong about the diagnosis. Fortunately, they were right and Suzanne quickly recovered. Meredith sought out Andrew to inform him about her status but he lashed out. She said that move could have ended his career had it gone wrong and she pointed out he was not in the right state of mind to make life-and-death decisions. He blamed her for being a hypocrite. Cormac tried to intervene but Meredith had it covered. Andrew went on praising himself for saving Suzanne's life against all odds, which led Meredith to point out he was sounding like his father. She suggested he get some sleep, but he said he didn't need any of this nor her. He told her they were done and left. Cormac suggested the write him up but Meredith declined. She sat down to text Alex, who started typing up a reply but stopped, which worried her.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAlex continued to dodge her even though she knew he was not in Iowa. As a blizzard hit Seattle and blocked off all roads, Cormac was unable to get a donor liver from Seattle Pres to Grey Sloan. Andrew overheard and offered to go get it himself, being used to the cold due to growing up in Wisconsin. Meredith tried to talk him out of it but he brushed off her concerns and took off. While he was off, Meredith and Cormac worked to stabilize the girl, who developed a hemorrhage. As they waited, she told him about how she got fired and he talked about him and Cristina treating a kid with a similar condition in Switzerland, bringing up a story Cristina had told him about Alex saving a kid with that condition as well. He said Cristina talked about Alex a lot but Meredith was surprised to hear she had never mentioned her to Cormac.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith gets to know Cormac as they wait for the liver.]]\nAn hour after they got word Andrew had left Seattle Pres with the liver, Meredith got anxious. Cormac told her about moving to Switzerland after his wife's death, which she likened to her fleeing to San Diego. They talked about lives without their spouses and agreed the firsts without them are especially tough. Andrew then came in with the liver and frostbitten fingers, as he had forgotten to wear gloves. Meredith and Cormac saved the girl. She went to inform Andrew, whose fingers had been treated by Jackson. Together with Carina, she again voiced her concerns over his mental state but he ordered her to leave the room. She and Cormac left the hospital to go spoil their kids. He asked her who Andrew was to her. She replied he was a first, the first man she told \"I love you\" to after Derek. He told her it was nice to meet someone widowed young like him. She agreed. As she walked off, Cormac told her Cristina mentioned her \"twisted sister\" a lot, whom he now suspected was Meredith. She just shrugged and walked off.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOn her day off, she received a letter from Alex. He wrote that he had left Seattle, admitting he had chosen the easy way out as he didn't want her to give him crap for his decision to set him straight. He revealed he was with Izzie and explained that he reached out to get a letter of support for Meredith's trial, which finally gave him a good excuse to reach out to her. He wrote that during his call with Izzie, he heard children in the background, and Izzie told him they were his. She had used the frozen embryos, which he had given her permission to do way back when. He had secretly taken off to meet his twins right after the trial. He went on to describe his kids and his life with Izzie and said he needed to be a father to his kids, which Meredith had taught him how to be through being a mother to her kids. He wrote that he'd miss the hell out of her but assured her that she was perfectly capable of being her own person with him and Cristina gone. He also asked her not to show up to his house to talk him into returning to Seattle because, for the first time in his life, he felt that he was exactly where he needed to be. He concluded by saying she was always welcome to visit once she had accepted his decision so that his kids could meet their Auntie Mer, adding that he hoped she wouldn't hate him too much. Meredith was emotional but decided to respect his wish. Later, she explained to Zola that Uncle Alex had left.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Amelia inquired about Alex's departure but Meredith said she didn't want to talk about it. She and Levi treated Noelle, a woman who had had an accident working jobs through an app that she needed to make ends meet. The patient revealed she had been rationing her insulin. At that moment, Meredith was paged by Tom and found that he had cleared an entire floor for [[Griffin Ford]], a VIP billionaire patient, which explained the problem with admissions that Noelle had had. Tom had her examine Griffin, who came to the hospital looking for a medical reason as to why he had made a grave error that had caused a rocket to explode above Seattle. She reluctantly did the exam but took off as soon as Noelle's CT results got back, leaving Griffin in Jackson's care. Noelle coded and went into DIC. They were unable to save her. She ran into Tom, who asked her what she would do with Griffin's money. She had a whole list ready on how to improve the world. He then asked her how she decided which rules to break. She told him she just followed her gut to make the world better. At the end of the day, Meredith reflected on the inequity she had witnessed and told Bailey she missed Alex to cheer her up. She finally told someone she wasn't sure she could do this on her own. Bailey recognized the feeling, being the last one standing from her residency class, and then told Meredith that Richard was stepping down from surgery.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith meets her pro bono patients.]]\nOn her pro bono surgery day, she had  surgeries to divide among four surgeons, all before Tom would shut down the project at  PM. She tried to recruit Richard but he still refused to operate. Patients and their family members grew upset as Meredith had to solve multiple issues, like Andrew going behind her back and messing up her OR schedule to get a patient into an OR and away from her supposed aunt as he suspected the patient was a human trafficking victim. She ended up asking Tom for more time. He complied and spontaneously agreed to pay for the overtime, explaining that Griffin Ford paid them a lot of money. She pieced together that Tom had made a fake diagnosis to fit Griffin's agenda in exchange for a large amount of money, which Tom was planning on using to fix the world like she had advised him too. Suddenly, a code violet was called and she found Andrew making a scene in the OR waiting room, where he tried to keep his patient's aunt away from her niece. As he was yelling accusations, Meredith and other attendings formed a human circle around him, indicating he was the dangerous person rather than the aunt and convinced him to go to Bailey's office.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith convinces Andrew not to quit.]]\nShe later found out he had quit as he felt people were obstructing him in accomplishing the impossible and changing lives. She told him she loved him and begged him not to quit and instead take the suspension Bailey had proposed so that he wouldn't ruin his career. He agreed to that only if Meredith called the national trafficking hotline, which she agreed to. Later, Amelia came to ask for a spot for her veteran patient and when Meredith agreed, an uproar ensued among the other scheduled patients, who feared they'd be sent home without their promised surgery. Meredith then decided that everyone would get their surgery and that the hospital would host a monthly pro bono surgery day from here on out, for which she credited their generous donor. They managed to perform all the surgeries. Bailey later informed her that the aunt and her niece had disappeared, making them fear that Andrew had been right. Cormac complimented her on her work today but she was too concerned about the human trafficking situation to accept the praise. He then said he could finally see the twisted-ness Cristina had been talking about.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was supposed to accompany Richard to Los Angeles for his speech on his PathPen at the Surgical Innovation Conference but she had to stay home as her sitter got the flu. Zola set up a live feed for them to watch his talk, which went disastrously as he dismissed his Pen and started rambling nonsense about having found a cure for cancer. A worried Meredith watched in horror as Maggie and Cormac dragged Richard off the stage and called for an ambulance.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith and Bailey set up a war room at the hospital and gathered the attendings to figure out what was going on with Richard. Unlike the others, Meredith was convinced it was not Alzheimer's. Together with Maggie, she ran some cognitive tests, which he failed miserably. When Richard disappeared from his room, she found him hallucinating in an OR, about to slice open his abdomen. She told him she could fix him as he was the one who taught her everything about surgery, life, and being a parent. She said she wasn't ready to lose him yet. Her talk brought him back to reality and he handed over the scalpel. As he slowly realized something was wrong with him, he addressed her as Ellis. She took him back to his room. Still convinced it was something other than rapidly progressing Alzheimer's, she sought out Andrew, who secretly had been working on the case, and had him show her what he had come up with so far. She told him they wouldn't leave until they figured it out and got to work.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nThe two of them spent days at the hospital trying to find the diagnosis with other doctors coming and going to help out. After a week of Meredith ignoring her home life, Maggie reminded her of how she herself had pushed her mother while refusing to accept the reality of her impending death. She thought Meredith was doing the same to Richard, refusing to believe it was Alzheimer's. Since Tom and Amelia agreed it was Alzheimer's, Catherine decided to take him home. Meredith found Andrew disrespectfully yelling at Catherine for her decision. She sent him for a walk and apologized for his behavior. Meredith then joined Catherine, Maggie, and Bailey to go discharge Richard, who brought up that his feet and hands were numb. Meredith then convinced Catherine to let her run an EMG, which showed impaired function. Tom and Amelia then changed their opinion and agreed to a nerve biopsy. Right before the procedure, Andrew barged in and knocked over the tray with instruments to stop them from performing the biopsy. He said Richard had received a hip replacement with cobalt, which could be deteriorating and leaking into his blood. Meredith drew blood for a test, which came back positive. She advocated with Bailey to let Andrew scrub in to watch up close despite his inappropriate behavior before, though Bailey stressed that he was on the thin ice. Link successfully removed the hip, which would solve the problems.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith finds a broken down Andrew.]]\nAfter work, Cormac complimented Meredith on her diagnosis and asked her for a drink. She asked for a rain check and walked off. She then found a broken down Andrew sitting at the nurses' station. He had completely fallen apart. She pulled him up and took him home.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nShe didn't feel comfortable leaving him at home by himself so she took him back to work with her the next day, leaving him to rest in an on-call room. She informed Carina, who hated that she and Bailey had pushed him to this point in spite of her warnings about his condition. However, they yet again had to push him past his limits when [[Erin Banks]], the human trafficking victim, showed up at the hospital again asking for him specifically. They had Andrew accompany her during the pre-op exams. Meredith and Bailey operated on her and they discussed Andrew during the surgery. As Bailey remembered her own struggle to accept her mental illness, Meredith advocated for Bailey not to give up on Andrew either. They staged an intervention with Carina, Richard, and [[Cynthia Cole|his psychiatrist]]. Meredith told him that caring so much and fighting as hard for his patients as he did was a strength. He broke down as he had failed to attain the most important goal in his life, which was not to end up like his father. Meredith convinced him to fight as hard for himself as he had done for his patients, at which point he accepted to get treatment for his bipolar disorder. Afterward, Meredith and Bailey walked [[Abby Banks]] to the ICU to be reunited with her long-lost sister.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> At some point during the day, she also met her [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|new nephew]] and left the new parents to fight about the baby's name.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs COVID- first hit the United States, Seattle was amongst the country's cities to be hit the hardest, forcing Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to quickly adapt to the new reality. With all non-emergent surgeries cancelled, Meredith was one of the doctors doing shifts in the special COVID- ICU, where she had to run codes all the time and where most of her patients kept dying suddenly and unexpectedly. Since visitors were no longer routinely allowed, she had to witness how these patients died without their loved ones, who had to be informed either by a phone call or by another doctor who was assigned to the visitors' tent outside. She developed a habit of reciting surgical steps in her head to deal with her claustrophobia in the PPE. While working shifts, she also tried to contact Andrew, who had disappeared without a word. With yet another death imminent, she called the patient's daughter to rush to the hospital to be able to say goodbye. Her frustration finally hit a boiling point and she destroyed a supply room. She was surprised when Andrew arrived, now an attending. He informed her he was doing well and had spent his time asleep at home to keep the mania from creeping back in. While she was glad he was doing okay, she told him to inform people on his whereabouts.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nOn one of her breaks, she went outside to catch some fresh air. She ran into Cormac and Jackson, whom she was jealous of for having operated earlier that day. Having overheard her talk with Jackson, Cormac paged her to scrub in with him when [[Frankie Morris]] was admitted with a tree branch perforating his recently transplanted kidney. She was delighted to get to do what she is best at again. While operating, Cormac inquired about her kids. She hadn't seen them in two weeks since she was quarantining away from home. Cormac hoped his boys wouldn't go out and break the rules like Frankie had done, though Meredith understood Frankie, remembering how she was as a teenager. They successfully removed the injured pole of the kidney and had Frankie admitted to the ICU. An exhausted Meredith then returned to the COVID ICU. She received a text from Cormac inviting her for a whiskey in his office, but didn't see the text because she had fallen asleep. She woke up when Andrew showed up to take over from her. She put up some resistance, stating she could keep going after the high of the surgery, but Andrew reminded her that a certain friend had once stressed the importance of getting rest. She asked if she was his friend now. He said that she had saved him, so she could be whatever she wanted to be to him. She then agreed to let him take over. However, she collapsed in the parking lot, where Cormac found her unconscious. Meredith herself was dreaming of a [[Meredith's Beach|beach]], which she had dreamt about before while taking short naps in the COVID ICU. However, this time, she was greeted by Derek from a distance.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nShe was rushed inside and a COVID test came back positive. She was admitted to a regular room on a COVID ward, where she used her connections to get her a tablet to be able to stay on top of the situation at the hospital. After four days, Meredith found that the hospital was nearly at capacity for COVID patients so she requested to be allowed to go quarantine in a hotel as she felt fit enough. However, as Teddy and Andrew were debating her request, she passed out again, yet again finding herself at the beach with Derek. She tried to reach him but woke up as Andrew and Maggie got her back into bed and rushed her to radiology for a chest CT. After the scan showed a dire situation, Meredith suggested they start her on triple antiviral therapy on which she had found an article. Meredith once again awoke from a beach dream when Amelia video chatted with little Ellis. Maggie tried to talk to her about her healthcare directive but Meredith brushed it off so she could talk to her daughter. Back on the beach, she tried to reach Derek but somehow always ended up back at the starting point far away from him. He yelled that she was worried about the kids and that the sand wasn't real. She yelled back that she missed him, which he knew. Bailey later came in to talk about the healthcare directive, pointing out that Alex would have to make rough decisions over the phone if things went south. Meredith insisted Alex would know when to pull the plug and asked Bailey to distract her instead. Later, she explained to Cormac that it was tough to pick a new POA as everyone was like family to her. He advised her to write down exactly what she wanted and then pick someone who would defend her choices, like his late wife had chosen her sister instead of him. Meredith then admitted she was scared she wouldn't wake up if she were to fall asleep, though Cormac was confident she was tough enough to beat the virus. Meredith ended up picking Richard as her POA. She explained she didn't want a ventilator as there was a shortage. Richard pointed out that she might end up as one of the people needing it and stressed that everyone at the hospital needed her. Meredith once again fell asleep as labs showed a worsening condition. She tried to reach Derek again, making a run for it, but she tripped and fell. From a distance, Derek laughed and told her he would be right there for her when she was ready.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith sees George.]]\nWhile sound asleep, Meredith found herself on her beach again, this time with [[George O'Malley]] present. She was delighted to see him and he backed Derek's statement that the sand wasn't real, nor was the ocean or his body. She commented on his looking older than when he had died, which he attributed to her imagining him that way being more comfortable for her. He revealed he had checked in on her and her kids sometimes. She asked if she could decide to go back to the world of the living but he didn't know. He said if he had had the choice, he would have chosen to stay. As they walked, they discussed how his death had devastated her and how she managed to move on from his and even Derek's death. He stated that, unlike her, his mother had become stuck in the grief over his death. In reality, Meredith's condition progressively worsened and as her power of attorney, Richard was tasked with the decision about whether or not to admit her into a trial. As he agonized by her bedside, Meredith became aware of his presence and she imagined him on the beach with her and George, who talked about what he missed about life. Richard talked about trying to stay strong for everyone worrying about her. Meredith apologized to him for that while George pointed out that Richard might break if Meredith decided to stay on her beach. \"I know, George,\" she uttered. Surprised by her sudden communication, indicative of how far gone she was already, Richard decided in favor of the trial.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and George have a heart-to-heart on her beach.]]\nAs they lied down on the sand, Meredith asked George if he regretted having chosen [[Amanda]] over himself. He dodged the question and said out she would have done the same thing, pointing out she contracted COVID- by working the frontlines and thus putting others above herself. She then told him that that was something she had him to thank for, as he had shown her how to go all in for people. He profoundly changed her life yet she never got to tell him that before. The two of them were joined by Richard and Bailey as Meredith became aware of their presence watching over her in real life.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith briefly woke up and was informed by Andrew that they had gotten her into the antibody trial. After having received the treatment, her oxygen needs dropped yet she remained sound asleep. Meredith was briefly joined again on her beach by Bailey, whose mother had been admitted with COVID as well. Bailey had kept from Meredith and Richard that her mother was suffering from Alzheimer's she didn't want to open any old wounds for them, yet with her mother dying, she found herself at a loss when trying to handle the big feelings that came with the impending death of her mother. Meredith tried to show support yet she was too weak to react to her opening up.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Meredith woke up and showed a spectacular recovery. Amelia came in to update her on her kids and Andrew was optimistic they would be able to discharge her within a week if she continued to improve at the current rate. Andrew later returned to her room and she asked for an update on the patient he had taken over from her. He reported only three of them recovered. Meredith wished she could help but Andrew stated that he didn't feel helpful despite his daily shifts in the COVID ward. He was then paged away. Later, Meredith was surprised by a visit from Tom, who had heard from Maggie about her miraculous recovery. Having bribed a nurse to wheel him to Meredith's room, Tom uttered that he needed to be in a room where no one was dying. He broke down and Meredith reached for his hand to comfort him. During a talk about why neurosurgeons are the best lovers, a code blue was called for a patient down the hall. Both of them missed saving lives and were frustrated about having to sit on the sidelines. They overheard that the patient didn't pull through.  As they talked about their kids, a nurse spotted Tom and brought him back to his room. She had a nap and was woken up by a beeping monitor from the patient across the hall. She pulled her own alarm to start a code blue, but when there was no immediate response, Meredith made her way across the hall and started compressions. She intubated the patient with the help of two nurses before the code team arrived. She then collapsed in Taryn's arms. A passed-out Meredith was scanned and her lungs showed significant damage, which Teddy didn't find surprising as the trial drug couldn't reverse damage that already occurred. She suspected Meredith had been on a COVID high and the exertion had pushed her over the edge. Teddy deemed that Meredith's lungs were at a breaking point and suggested they needed to put her on a vent. With more patients surviving recently after having been on a vent, Richard agreed with her suggestion. Meredith was moved to the ICU, where Teddy intubated her and put her on a vent. Meanwhile, Meredith found herself back on her beach, overlooking the ocean.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith remained comatose. She was joined on her beach by Andrew, who had been stabbed while tailing a [[Opal|human trafficker]]. Andrew questioned if they were alive. She thought that they were. They agreed the beach suited them both. Before she could ask, he told her he didn't regret what he had done. People go through life ignoring atrocities all the time but it makes sense to stand up and fight for people, like Meredith had shown him with [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabby]]. Andrew's condition worsened in real life. On the beach, he started building a sandcastle and Meredith warned him about the rising tide, a metaphor for his death. He was aware and worked fast to beat the tide. He said he had more to do, more plans in life. The water then destroyed his castle. Defeated, he admitted he had no clue what would happen now. Meredith didn't know either. He told Meredith he never felt seen the way she saw him. She made him want to be better. He felt small around her sometimes because he wanted something from her that only he could give himself. Being on the beach with her, he finally felt that true acceptance of who he was and what his strengths were. Meredith suggested they take a walk to watch the sunset, but he wanted to hold on to the feeling for a little while longer. With Andrew slipping away on the OR table, he and Meredith ended up watching the sunset. His mother appeared on the beach at a distance and called out for him. Realizing the moment had come, Meredith told Andrew she would miss him if she were to end up going back without him. He told her it would be okay. He realized he had to go now. He got up and eagerly ran towards his mother, who happily embraced him. Andrew briefly turned around and waved at her before walking off into the afterlife with his mother as Meredith watched him leave.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith's numbers slowly began to improve, Teddy began lightening her sedation and ventilator settings. Meredith continued to spend time with Derek on her beach, while Cormac sat by her side asking her to pull through since the hospital couldn't handle another loss after Andrew. Meredith found the obligatory distance between her and Derek to be torture, which he pointed out was her own doing. She brought up that he never got to meet Ellis, but he showcased enough knowledge about her and her resemblance to Meredith as well as Zola writing him letters to inform her that he had been watching over them. Derek also told her that if she wanted to get closer to him, she had to do that herself by relaxing. She tried that, which resulted in the two of them getting a little closer. Meanwhile, Meredith's numbers deteriorated, so Teddy turned back the ventilator settings. Cormac set up a video chat between Zola and a tablet in Meredith's room so Zola could talk to her mother. This as well as Cormac asking her to fight for her kids got through to Meredith and Derek on her beach. Derek told Meredith it was up to her but he advised her to listen to Cormac. She then let him in, replacing Derek on her beach. He talked about her kids and their traits and how they needed for her to fight. Meredith wasn't sure that she could since the beach was comfortable and pain-free. Cormac talked about he loss of his wife impacted their kids and again begged her to fight. Derek then reappeared and told her he would be right there for her. She then decided to fight and walked away from him. Cormac was delighted to see her move her head. He set up a livestream to Andrew's memorial service him, while Meredith herself began pulling away again as she went back to talking to Derek, the distance between them gradually decreasing.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith remained stable on the vent. She appeared in Teddy's subconsciousness as Teddy went catatonic at Andrew's memorial service. Meredith guided her to examine the causes for her behavior over the years, hinting that she had to look further back than her affair with Tom. Eventually, Teddy traced back the root of the issues to her guilt over the loss of Allison and other people in her life, including her parents, Henry, and Andrew, as well as Meredith barely holding on. Meredith told Teddy that all those people couldn't have been saved regardless of Teddy's actions. Meredith pointed out the losses had taught Teddy to run from pain as well joy for thinking she didn't deserve the latter. She said joy and pain are a package deal in life. Meredith got her to accept that. Teddy begged her not to die and Meredith said she would do her best.<ref>[[In My Life]], x</ref>\n\nAs her oxygen sats began improving significantly, Meredith was moved from the ICU to regular room with her ventilator. Her doctors were comfortable with getting her off the vent, yet feared that there would not be a ventilator available for her due to a hospital-wide shortage if she were to trend downward again. Meredith was visited on her beach by Mark and Lexie. Lexie asked her if she was going to stay. Meredith wasn't sure. Mark thought it was too early for her since Zola was only Sofia's age. Meredith told them about Derek but Mark said it wasn't up to him. As she watched Lexie and Mark frolic on the beach, she reiterated that she liked the beach. Later, Mark told Meredith it was nice to talk her, since most of the time people he tried to talking to didn't seem to hear him. Lexie asked Meredith about her favorite thing about life. Meredith replied it felt shallow to talk about that in the middle of a pandemic. Lexie pointed out that didn't mean she wasn't allowed to enjoy her life, stating that the having of a life and body was cause for celebration. If not, there was no point in avoiding death and she may as well just join Derek now. Meredith then told a story of Bailey made everyone laugh by faceplanting into his birthday cake. Meanwhile, Meredith was extubated and remained stable. Back on the beach, Meredith concluded that life is pain, with which Mark and Lexie disagreed. She cited her losses and all the pain in her life. Mark pointed out she knew what caused all the pain. Since Meredith couldn't bring herself to say it, Lexie said the depth of grief came from the depth of love. They advised Meredith not to fight change and resist pain, deeming it a waste of life. Meredith told them she missed them so much. Lexie said they never left her. Together, they told Meredith not to waste a single more minute of life.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\nSince Meredith still didn't wake up despite no longer being sedated and off the vent, Richard ordered a CT to find a possible underlying cause. The CT came back negative. Jo then came in to tell Meredith that she was changing specialties to OB because she needed to find job and her home life wasn't bringing her joy anymore. She hoped Meredith would wake up soon so she could tell her all that again while she was awake. However, she finally woke up later that day and told Richard that she was sorry he had had to decide whether or not to put her on a vent. He told her he would do it again in a heartbeat. Meredith then told him they needed to talk about Jo and shared what Jo had told her before. Soon after, she fell asleep again for the rest of the day.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nMoved back to the ICU, Meredith continued to spend most of the time being asleep. Teddy and Bailey tasked Levi with taking her to the hyperbaric chamber, which they hoped would help. They ended up having to share the chamber with [[James Chee]] and his patient. James asked Levi if Meredith really was as mean as he'd heard. Levi replied that he heard her voice with every win that he booked. He called her his most influential teacher, tough when need be. When the other patient's abdominal wound opened up, Levi handled the situation perfectly with Meredith's guiding voice in his head from when they handled a similar complication together before.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith improved and she was moved back to a regular room, yet remained at all times unconscious or asleep. Her vitals remained stable and imaging showed improvement, confusing her doctors as to why she wasn't waking up. Meredith herself spent more time on her beach with Derek where they talked about his death. He says the worst part was knowing the doctors were getting it wrong and eventually, the desire to rest outweighed the desire to stay. Meredith recalled the moment of giving him her blessing to go. Derek appreciated that she gave him everything he needed until his last breath. Meredith wanted to get closer to Derek yet knew she might never leave the beach if she did. She brought up his handling his father's death and said their children would be okay, too. As they brought up Amelia, Derek told Meredith that people love and need her. Derek knew Meredith was still fighting to live despite feeling tired, since her soul wouldn't let him come close. She inquired if it was hard for him to see her dating other men. He replied it was harder to see her lonely. He commented on her beauty yet acknowledged it felt shallow; she said she taught their children to say \"pretty on the inside.\" Meanwhile, Winston chatted to Meredith, wishing she would wake up to meet him and congratulate him on getting engaged to her sister. Her labs eventually showed elevated liver enzymes. A CT revealed a blood clot in her liver so Teddy and Winston carefully performed a TIPS procedure to remove the clot. \n\nMeanwhile, Meredith told Derek that Ellis draws about the two of them in traditional wedding clothes. As she told that story, they suddenly found themselves wearing exactly that. They held a little impromptu wedding ceremony. Meredith asked Derek what he wanted her to promise. He wanted her to torture herself less. They then leaned into a near-kiss while Meredith said she didn't want to leave the kids. After the procedure, Meredith's labs improved yet she still didn't wake up for hours. Winston then orchestrated a visit from Zola with Maggie and Richard's help. As Zola talked to her mother, all of her close colleagues gathered outside the room. Back on the beach, Derek told Meredith it wasn't her time yet. While she stated she enjoyed the beach where pain didn't exist, he told her he even missed the pain of being alive. He said she needed to go back to their kids. Meredith finally woke up as Zola was talking about allowing Ellis and Bailey into her room. Meredith faintly told her daughter that that was nice of her. Zola hugged her mother and said she loved her. Meredith then told her that \"they\" loved her, too. As the doctors celebrated, Derek walked away from Meredith as she finally chose to live.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith aced her respiratory exams and was prepared to be discharged while Bailey and Richard struggled to tell her about DeLuca's death. As they awaited her final lab results, Maggie and Richard took Meredith for walks down the hallways. Meredith was eager to finally meet her soon-to-be brother-in-law, whose dance moves Zola couldn't shut up about. As Meredith asked for more updates, Richard decides not to tell her about Andrew and told her that Jackson was leaving for Boston to take on a leadership role within the Fox Foundation. When the physical therapist cleared Meredith to go home, she started clearing out her room as Jackson joined her to say goodbye. Meredith said his departure officially made her the last man standing of their residency class. She recalled thinking he had a big name to live up to. Jackson said that name was ruined now but Meredith was confident he could make it his own and re-invent it. She then expressed desire not to face the traditional clap-out, where he planned for their final goodbye to take place. He encouraged her to let people celebrate the win. She told him to \"go give 'em hell\" in Boston and he thanked her for showing him how. Soon after, Richard and Bailey finally gathered the courage to tell her about Andrew. As soon as they brought up his name, Meredith had her experiences echo in her mind and told them that Andrew was with his mother. Meredith decided not to sit through the clap-out and had Jackson sneak her out through the back exit. They laughed as they got in his car and he drove her home. She surprised Amelia and her kids as they were preparing for her arrival. The kids finished their \"welcome home\" sign as they sat with their mother on the couch. Amelia swore they didn't spent months living a chaotic life like this. Meredith enjoyed the chaos and complimented Amelia on keeping her household running. She showed her profound gratitude as Link came rushing in to warn everyone about Meredith's arrival. Much to his surprise, she was already there. He fetched the donuts and Meredith had her kids fill her in on their lives.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref>\n\nDuring her first week of recovery, Meredith found Amelia hovering over her. She urged Amelia to go be of use to the world at work. The next week, Meredith started to be come more active. She was throwing a ball around with her son when Bailey visited. Meredith was exhausted from the activity and asked Bailey to talk about her life to distract her. After a month, Bailey dropped by to give Meredith a suture kit so she could get her dexterity back. Meredith had been reading up on the effects of long-COVID, which terrified her. Bailey tried to encourage her to talk a walk with her but Meredith wasn't feeling up for it. She said she'd never operate again if she couldn't stand on her feet long enough. Picking up her kids felt like running a marathon. Meredith was growing tired of people hovering over her and just wanted her old life back. Two weeks later, Bailey visited again and Meredith said Jackson and Tom had the right idea. She spent weeks fighting to get back to normal but she now realized that normal entailed sexism, racism, inequality, and substandard care. Bailey then proposed Meredith take over the residency program from Richard, who had too many jobs and would step back one day. She asked Meredith to put together a team that reflected their world and take over all the classes and shape them to sandblast bias out of the curriculum for future surgeons. Meredith accepted the job.<ref>[[I'm Still Standing]], x</ref>\n\nIn August , Meredith returned to work as residency director. She decided not to use Richard's infamous speech and instead jumped right in by asking the residents about the status of the newly admitted COVID patients. She later met Cormac in front of the OR board. He assured her she would be operating again soon, which she doubted. He then joked she could have just turned him down when he asked her for that drink rather than getting COVID. She commented that seemed like a lifetime ago and recalled him coming into her room to tell her to fight for her kids. Meredith left work early to attend Maggie's wedding in the backyard, which was postponed indefinitely mid-ceremony. \n\nA month later, Meredith met [[Gerlie Bernardo]], who was being discharged after having spent a month in the hospital with COVID. Having struggled with her own recovery, Gerlie found it reassuring to see Meredith back at work. Meredith sympathized with the residual symptoms Gerlie was experiencing, survivor's guilt being one of them. Meredith confided that that would never go away. Gerlie then collapsed and was re-admitted. Meredith took on her case and used it as a hands-on approach to teach the residents in a more practical manner, substituting the traditional grand rounds. Bailey was surprised with her approach to teaching but Meredith reminded her she was hired to change things around. However, during Gerlie's bronchoscopy, Meredith became dizzy and had to have Maggie take over.\n\nBy Christmas Eve, Gerlie had further deteriorated and had to put on ECMO on Christmas Eve. Meredith took to researching lung transplants in COVID patients. Cormac met her in the attendings' lounge and presented her with a half-empty bottle of whiskey. They finally shared their first drink. The next morning, Amelia, Link, Owen, Teddy, and their kids came over to Meredith's house for Christmas. During the celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy. As the new year began, the hospital received vaccines for the staff. Meredith began advocating for Gerlie to be put on the transplant list but Bailey shut her down, believing Gerlie would recover without the transplant. Meredith then had the residents continually press for the transplant whenever Bailey rounded with them. Bailey confronted Meredith about her tactics but Meredith stated that people suffering from the aftereffects of COVID needed advocates, too. Since she had learned that life could be short, she wanted to teach the residents what mattered most. Bailey then agreed to put Gerlie on the transplant list only if Meredith agreed to re-implement grand rounds.\n\nBy April , Meredith and her kids attended Winston and Maggie's beach wedding. Shortly after the ceremony, Meredith received words that UNOS had found lungs for Gerlie. Teddy and Meredith left the wedding to perform the surgery. As they got started, Meredith said it had helped for her to have a village of people pulling for her with every complication. Since Gerlie had no one, they had to be her village. Meredith rallied and finished the procedure without a problem. Post-procedure, they were met with a round of applause from the surgical staff for Meredith's recovery. As she sat by Gerlie's bedside, Meredith let Cristina know that she successfully performed a double lung transplant. Gerlie woke up surprised to see Meredith by her side; Meredith replied she wasn't going anywhere.<ref>[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter having fully recovered, Meredith and Cormac started seeing each other but their romance was short-lived since it caused his so Austin to suffer from panic attacks. Putting his children first, they quickly ended things.\n\nMeredith was invited to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota by [[David Hamilton]], a former colleague of her mother's, to attend the opening of a research library named after Ellis. While in Minnesota, Meredith was plagued by nightmares in which her mother challenged her to do more with her life than being a regular general surgery attending after having miraculously survived COVID. During her visit to the Clinic, Richard, Bailey, and Cormac called her to remind her of her ties to Grey Sloan and she swore she wasn't there for a job interview. Upon meeting David, he commented she was the spitting image of her mother and guided her to The Grey Center for Medical Research, a research lab he had begun to put together for Meredith if she were interested. He showed her around the lab and its extensive state-of-the-art equipment and explained he was developing cellular therapy for experimental surgery to cure Parkinson's disease. He had everything except a famous surgeon to convince the FDA to grant approval for a clinical trial, revealing that he intended for himself to be the first patient. David invited Meredith to dinner, where she noticed his tremor. David explained her name had become synonymous to cutting-edge and seeing things through to the end. She had him explain the idea behind the project and he stressed the opportunity to become the public face of a possible cure for Parkinson's disease. As she pondered his proposal, she saw [[Nick Marsh]] leaving the restaurant with his date. She told David she wasn't a neurosurgeon but he was confident she would attract the best talent for the project.\n\nUpon returning to the hotel, an employee escorted her to the bar where she found Nick waiting for her. He took a chance and guessed she would be staying at the five-star hotel near the hospital. Over drinks, he said he had spotted her back at the restaurant. His date was horrible. She shared she had just ended things with someone though that didn't mean the two of them would be sleeping together, which he was fine with. He updated her on Charlotte leaving for college and she told him she had survived COVID. He understood being a miracle was a lot of pressure, bearing the question of what you'll be doing with it. Nick walked her back to her room and she explained she would be staying a few more days to look at research. They wished each other good night and shared looks as he walked off. Meredith couldn't help but smile as she closed the door.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\nWhile up to get some water, Meredith heard something and found a note had been slid under her door. She quickly opened her door and called for Nick, who came back from around the corner. He had forgotten to ask for her number and wanted to ask her out on a date without waking her. She happily agreed to a date at a place by the lake. The next morning, Meredith had Amelia flown in from Seattle and informed her about the proposal as she showed her around the lab, stating she wanted Amelia to be part of the project if she were to accept it. After Amelia examined David, they went back to the lab where they met [[Kai Bartley]], a neuroscientist who had already boarded the project. Their work completely convinced Amelia, yet Meredith remained hesitant. Meredith questioned the influence the project would have on their kids' lives. Amelia said revolutionizing medicine would be a great example. Meredith remained on the fence about the consequences of a possible failure. Afterward, Meredith walked Amelia back to her car and thanked her for her input. Meredith locked eyes with Nick while Amelia kept talking about how on board she was with the project.\n\nAt the end of the day, Meredith found Nick waiting for her in the lobby in casual clothes while she had dressed herself up. She changed into something more comfortable. He took her to a favorite spot of his by the lake where he shared that he had cut back on his hours because he was starting to ignore the beautiful world around him. Meredith admitted she was, too. He asked her about the top-secret project she was in town for her. She admitted she was scared to say yes since it was risky, cost millions of dollar, and had the possibility of turning her into a public failure, while she had a safe and comfortable situation in Seattle. Thinking they were of similar nature, Nick knew she would trade all of that in for this project. No matter the outcome, it would be one hell of a ride. Meredith met up with David at the lab and set rules first. She demanded autonomy to pick her team and made sure any progress would be public and accessible to everyone. He agreed to all of those but refused to move the project to Seattle since it would cost them time he didn't have and even more money. Meredith then agreed to travel back and forth once a week. They shook hands as she finally accepted the proposal.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\n\nShe is intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, has good medical instincts, and a natural flair for medicine.\n\nMeredith and Derek have been described as polar opposites. She described herself as \"dark and twisty\" due to her negativity, in contrast to Derek's charismatic optimism. And unlike Derek, who viewed the world in distinct shades of black and white, Meredith tends to see things in shades of gray, which [[Carolyn Shepherd]] remarked to her son that was what he needed, while she was visiting Seattle.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Devil]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, this difference in viewpoints culminated in what was a breach of their marriage, when she messed up Derek's Alzheimer drug trial. She secretly accessed the pharmacy, where the trial drugs were stored, and subsequently swapped the placebo for the actual drug, for Patient #, aka Adele. And when busted by a drunk Alex, who had seen her behaving suspiciously, she much later confided in Cristina that she felt that her actions were justified, as Adele was Richard's wife, and she should do something since Adele was about to have saline injected into her brain, and the trial drug sample could help her from becoming a 'gorked out lump', in her own words. The couple subsequently got into an argument in the changing room, where Derek argued that it was Alzheimer's, a disease that she could potentially have, and one whose progression he was trying to stop or cure, while at the same time espousing that everything was black and white, a right and a wrong. Meredith responded that the situation was much more complicated than that, as it was Richard and Adele.\n\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\n[[Image:der-mer-sex.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Derek wake up after their first encounter.]]\nMeredith and Derek first met at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's Bar]] the night before her first day at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Derek approached her, they got drunk, before ending up at her place, sleeping with each other. When she went to work, she discovered, much to her shock, that Derek too worked at Seattle Grace, as an attending, so she staunchly refused to date him, although they did manage to sneak by a few stolen sexually charged moments. However, it was eventually at the unexpected house party that went out of control that she finally gave in and the two got intimate in the car. Despite Miranda Bailey, who felt that Derek was beginning to show signs of favoritism towards Meredith the following day, catching them in the act, the pair began to date secretly, something which her roommates would eventually discover, and thus were mostly not too pleased about as they thought she was trying to win favors and felt uncomfortable sharing living space with their \"boss's boss.\" They became public quickly, although [[Richard Webber]] discovered and disapproved of the relationship, knowing that Derek was still married to Addison. Their relationship temporarily ended when [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Shepherd]] arrived at the hospital for a medical case and claimed to be Derek's wife, thereby surprising her.\n\n[[File:Candles.jpg|thumb|px| Meredith and Derek's future house (made of candles).]]\nMeredith stayed away from Derek but later asked him to make a choice between her or Addison. Derek tried to make a decision, but it was a hard one, as he had been married to Addison for eleven years. He eventually chose Addison and Meredith was left heartbroken. Addison stayed at Seattle Grace and Meredith was left alone and when news of the scandal leaked out, she became much of the hospital's talking points and gossip. After avoiding each other, they attempted friendship, but on the night of the Seattle Grace prom, they had sex in an exam room despite the fact that Meredith was dating [[Finn Dandridge]] and Derek was married to Addison. An unexpected event of the secret rendezvous was Meredith losing her panties when Derek had pocketed them. The next day, Addison found Meredith's panties in Derek's pocket and realized her marriage was over. After Derek caught Addison and [[Mark Sloan]] together again, they both admitted their relationship was finished. He told Meredith that if she wanted, they could date and that he loved her. Meredith tried to choose between Derek and Finn, but when she was unable to decide between the two men, she decided to date both of them until she decided. After Derek decided to be a better person and let her go and be with Finn, she realized she wanted Derek and broke up with Finn. She didn't tell Derek immediately because he was going through his divorce with Addison but when she finally did, he no longer cared, as he was suffering from Addison's secret about her and Mark living together for months, after he had left her.\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek and Meredith get engaged.]]\n\nThey started dating again, but Derek later complained that she was constantly leaving him and that she should be worried that the highlight of his week was meeting another girl at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]]. When [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] and [[Preston Burke|Burke]] called off their wedding, she broke up with Derek, not convinced that relationships could work. They tried to stay apart but began having break-up sex, and mockery. Later, Derek kissed a nurse named [[Rose]] in the scrub room; when Meredith found out, she severed all ties with him. Derek and Meredith started a clinical trial but Derek began dating [[Rose]] and her feelings for him started to come back as the clinical trial continued. After their last clinical trial patient survived the surgery, Meredith and Derek celebrated and she showed him a house of candles she had made. He kissed her and they got back together. Trying to take steps forward, Meredith asked him to move in and he accepted. They stayed together and after his mother's visit, Derek decided to propose with his mother's engagement ring. Meredith originally thought he was avoiding her because of a conversation they had about babies, but he insisted that he wanted to have all her babies. Derek planned to propose to her, with a ring from his mother but remarked to Mark that the timing had to be right, otherwise she would bolt. Derek's plans to propose left his mind after he accidentally killed a patient. [[Richard Webber|Richard]] told Meredith about the ring, but the despondent Derek hit the ring into the woods, with a baseball bat. He apologized and she forgave him and he proposed properly to her later. They planned a wedding, but when they realized that Izzie had stage  cancer, they eventually gave their wedding to Izzie and Alex. With very little time to get married themselves, they went to the locker room, wrote down their vows on a Post-it note, and married each other.\n[[File:Postit.jpg|thumb|xpx|The post-it note that married Derek and Meredith.]]\nAfter their Post-it marriage, they referred to each other as husband and wife and in the days immediately after their wedding, they had sex frequently, while often getting caught in the act, in different places in the house, by those living there. Later, she found out she was pregnant. The shooting that happened after the death of a patient of Derek's, when the patient's husband shot numerous people, also shooting Derek was traumatizing for both of them, especially as Meredith miscarried because of the events of that day. She waited to tell him about this long after his recovery wondering how he would react. Then they proceeded to try to conceive, but they learned Meredith had a hostile uterus, which made it unlikely she would conceive naturally.\n\nEventually, the two did formally marry, as it would make it easier for them to legally adopt Zola, an African girl Derek got to know while treating her spina bifida. Derek engaged Meredith in his Alzheimer's clinical trial, trying to find a cure for her mother's disease. When Adele Webber became part of their trial, however, Meredith's emotions started to cloud her judgment, and as a result, she switched the placebo with the active medication, so Adele would get better. This caused Alex to become suspicious when he saw her acting weird. When Alex was drunk, he told Owen Hunt about this incident, who continued to alarm Derek and Richard. Derek then continued to become really angry at Meredith, accusing her of not knowing the difference between right or wrong and saying it wasn't any way to raise a child. It took them a long time to resolve these differences in their marriage and their separation caused trouble with Zola's adoption, for which each blamed the other. However, in times of crisis, they made up and all of them lived happily as a family after Alex, feeling guilty, managed to get them Zola back. Even after enduring the horrible plane crash, in which both her sister and his best friend died, and Derek's hand was severely injured, their bond only grew stronger and they helped each other. Meredith discovered she was pregnant with Derek's child. Though both of them were really happy, Meredith was very concerned due to her hostile uterus, but Derek remained optimistic, and she was still pregnant. During the \"superstorm,\" Meredith gave birth, via c-section, to a baby boy whom she named [[Derek Bailey Shepherd]] after both Derek and [[Miranda Bailey]].<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the birth of Bailey, Meredith and Derek enjoyed their time with their children. Eventually, Derek was offered a job with the president. At first, Meredith was upset as Derek promised her that she could kickstart her career but eventually grew not to mind. They were going to move to DC. but Meredith decided she wanted to stay, so Derek resigned from Grey Sloan.\n\nThe couple argued on and off over his new job and he moved to DC in the heat of the moment. He flew back and forth between Seattle and DC, putting a strain on their marriage. He eventually grew to realize that he was miserable without his family and wanted to be with them more than \"saving the world.\" Meredith also realized that she could live without him, but she didn't want to. They both became very happy once Derek moved back to Seattle. Meredith even told her friends that she had never been happier with her husband and kids. The two were lying in bed together the day before his death and Derek said that she was the one that saved him. On his way back to DC to resign, he got into a car accident and died.<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref> When Derek died, Meredith was pregnant with their third child, Ellis.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nAfter losing  patients to COVID-, Meredith had been more stressed out than ever, causing a breakdown and a trashed supply closet. Soon after, she was found in the middle of the hospital's parking lot, having collapsed. Suddenly waking up on a beach, Meredith tried to recollect what had just happened, but then a faint voice calls out to her in the distance. After staring long enough at the figure far away, she realizes that it's Derek, waving his arms and smiling. A shocked Meredith catches her breath in realization.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n[[Finn Dandridge]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith and Finn at \"prom\"]]\nFinn Dandridge was a veterinarian to [[Doc]], Meredith and Derek's dog. He met Meredith when Doc got sick and Meredith brought him in. He asked her out and she agreed, despite her and Izzie being celibate. They started a serious relationship and often had sleepovers. At the Seattle Grace prom, Finn said he had plans for his and Meredith's future. Meredith was happy and tried to make the relationship work. However, after an argument with Derek, Meredith ended up cheating on Finn with Derek. Finn found out, and albeit annoyed, he wanted to work past it. Meredith was glad, but she realized she couldn't choose between Finn and Derek, so she started dating them both at the same time until she chose. After a fierce competition, Derek decided to let Meredith go, but as soon as he let her go, Meredith realized she wanted to be with him. She broke up with Finn, who told her Derek was no good for her before he walked out for the last time. His nickname was \"McVet,\" as opposed to Derek's \"McDreamy.\"\n\n[[William Thorpe]]\nWhen William Thorpe and Meredith worked together on a patient, [[Brian Carson]], he flirted with her and asked to follow up with her. She initially didn't realize he was flirting, but once she figured it out, she went back and gave him her personal number.<ref>[[All Eyez on Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Will asks for Meredith's phone number]]\nHe then called her several times, but she didn't answer the phone. Still wanting to pursue her, Will came to the hospital and asked Meredith on a date in person.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith agreed to go get drinks, but panicked and canceled. However, he showed up at the hospital after she got out of surgery and offered to take her home. They got food and ate in the car, talking.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nOn their third date, Will and Meredith had sex. However, the morning after, Meredith yelled at Will, asking him to leave immediately. He later came to the house and she told him about Derek and said she thought she was ready, but she wasn't. He said he'd back off for a while and wait, but he'd call and then come back. He believed she was worth waiting for.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nNathan and Meredith were initially at odds, with her disliking him out of loyalty for Owen.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref> Due to Owen's stories, she began to notice he was prone to making rash medical decisions, and their opinions quite often differed. However, she has shown to be able to put her dislike aside so it wouldn't affect patients, or when Nathan told her his side of the story. When Meredith had a bad day, he confronted her about it in the parking lot. They started arguing and ended up having sex in her car.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> It happened four times, but Meredith didn't want him to get too attached to her. He claimed he knew they were just friends who had sex, but during Owen and Amelia's wedding, he smilingly looked at her, indicating he had started to feel more for her.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> Later at the wedding, Nathan and Meredith flirted and he asked her to dance, only for Maggie to interrupt and dance with him, leaving Meredith to watch the two.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref> Nathan continued to try to get closer to Meredith, and although she liked him, she kept brushing him off as she knew Maggie liked him too. Finally, Nathan showed up at Meredith's house, verbally confirming his feelings for her. Meredith lied to him, saying she didn't return the feelings, out of consideration for Maggie. Meredith also warned Nathan that Maggie was going to ask him out, which Nathan believed to be the reason Meredith rejected his pursuits.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex later noticed the way Meredith looked at Nathan, he encouraged her to go after him, but soon changed his mind when he and Nathan disagreed over a case. Meredith told Nathan that butting heads with Alex was not the way to pursue her. Later that day, Nathan told Meredith to stop listening to what people were telling her about him and listen to her own feelings for a change. He admitted he kept thinking about her and that he'd be all in if she wanted it to happen. He left her to think about it, and she decided that she wanted him to give her a reason to go for it. He spent an entire day trying to come up with her but instead told her about how he fell for her the first time he saw her. Meredith then told him to ask her out to dinner, which he did, and she said yes.\n\nHowever, their dinner plans were canceled when Maggie's mother's health took a turn for the worst and Meredith had to support Maggie throughout her mother's treatment. After Diane eventually passed away, Nathan and Meredith agreed that their timing wasn't right to start something between them and indefinitely postponed their dinner plans, since Maggie would heavily rely on Meredith in the near future.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Nathan and Meredith flirt at a dinner party]]\nMeredith and Nathan found themselves sitting next to each other on a plane, both heading to a conference. Meredith went to the bathroom, but Nathan followed her, intent on talking to her about their situation. They ended up having sex. After the plane landed and passengers were tended to, Nathan proposed that they get a hotel room and Meredith accepted.<ref>[[In the Air Tonight]], x</ref>\n\nNathan and Meredith began a relationship, which involved them telling Maggie that they were a couple, and Meredith began to open herself up more to Nathan. He slept over frequently, and Meredith even considered introducing Nathan to her kids over dinner. However, upon the discovery of Nathan's long-lost fianc\uee, Megan, who had been abducted  years ago when they were both in Iraq, Nathan and Meredith abruptly ended their relationship. Although Nathan tried to convince Meredith that he was still in love with her and that Megan didn't want to be with him, Meredith continued to send Nathan back to Megan because she didn't want Nathan to blow his opportunity to rekindle his romance with Megan. Eventually, Nathan moved to Los Angeles to start a new life with Megan. They ended on friendly terms with both of them thanking the other one for what they had meant in each other's lives.\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew drunkenly kissed Meredith, and she rejected his advances, though she told him she was flattered. The next morning, Meredith found herself dreaming about Andrew and was reminded of her thoughts when he apologized at the hospital for kissing her. Meredith continued to dream about Andrew as she began going on dates with the help of her matchmaker patient, [[Cece Colvin|Cece]]. Most of Meredith's dates did not end well while, unbeknownst to her, Andrew realized his feelings for her.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Andrew at Catherine's party]]\n\nWith the encouragement of Jo, Meredith asked out [[Atticus Lincoln]] for drinks, prompting Andrew to finally confess his feelings for Meredith. She told him she had to think about it, but that same day, they got trapped in an elevator during the wind storm. In the elevator, Andrew opened up to Meredith about his difficult childhood back in Italy under his famous surgeon father. Meredith revealed to Andrew that she speaks some Italian, and they grew closer, almost sharing a kiss before the elevator started working again. After working on a surgery together, Andrew proposed that he and Meredith go out on a date before they got interrupted by Link, who reminded Meredith that she had asked him out for drinks. Meredith realized that she was in another love triangle between Andrew and Link.\n\nSometime later, Meredith still hadn't made a decision, but she made a date with Andrew for Alex and Jo's New Year's Eve party. When she stood him up to monitor a patient, he began getting impatient over her indecisiveness. On Valentine's Day, Meredith asked Link out to dinner, but that night, Andrew took her up to the hospital roof for a drink, and the two shared their first kiss.\n\nBecause Maggie had dated Andrew years ago, Meredith wanted to get her approval before starting to date Andrew. When Maggie said she was fine with the relationship, Meredith allowed Andrew to take her out on a date, officially beginning their relationship. At Catherine Avery's party, Meredith and Andrew went off to make out in Jackson's guest room and were caught by Richard, exposing their relationship. Meredith also told Alex that she was dating Andrew, and Alex said that she should report their relationship to HR and that he hoped Andrew makes her happy. After Zola caught Andrew trying to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night, Meredith decided to tell her kids about her relationship with Andrew, which was received well. \n\nWhile working on a case together that involved Meredith committing insurance fraud so that a young immigrant girl could get a surgery she needed, Meredith spent the whole day thinking Andrew disapproved of her breaking the rules. However, he revealed that he was actually in awe of her bravery and that he was afraid of accidentally blurting out that he loves her. With this declaration, Meredith walked out without returning the sentiment and spent some time avoiding Andrew. She told Jo that the 'I love you' scared her because the last person she said it to was Derek. However, after Andrew took the fall for Meredith's insurance fraud and was put in prison, Meredith told him that, as much as it terrified her, she loves him too.\n\nDuring Meredith's trial, she lost her temper at one of the doctors on the panel, the one who'd killed Derek. This led Andrew to realize how much she had respected Derek, and although Meredith warned him not to compare, he didn't feel equal to her. He told her to take some time.\n\nCarina was concerned that Andrew might have the mania that their father had, explaining that that was why he went to jail for Meredith and why he was obsessing over Suzanne Britland's case. Meredith listened, as she already had concerns about Andrew's health, since he wasn't sleeping or eating. She went to Bailey who handed Suzanne's case to her. Meredith completely changed the treatment, which upset Andrew, but after receiving bone marrow test results, he and Lauren realized that Suzanne might have Still's disease. He administered steroids to her, which angered Meredith because if he was wrong, Suzanne would be killed. In the end, Andrew was right. Meredith confronted him about his reckless actions, which Andrew defended, and she brought up the point that he was acting like his father. He told her that he didn't need \"this\" and he didn't need her, breaking up with her for good.\n\n[[Cormac Hayes]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Hayes and Meredith getting coffee]]\nThey dated briefly after a long period of flirting until his son started having panic attacks due to his dating.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nick Marsh]]\nNick performed a kidney transplant at Grey Sloan as a visiting surgeon. When he was about to leave, he collapsed from his own recent kidney transplant and was admitted as a patient. Meredith treated him, and while they waited for his test results, they got to know each other. Later Nick thanked Meredith for saving his life. After work, Meredith told Alex that Nick made her feel something she hadn't felt since Derek, though it didn't matter because Nick lived in Minnesota.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\nYears later, Meredith saw Nick in passing at a restaurant in Minnesota when she was there to consult on another case. Later that night, he found her hotel, and they talked over drinks. He walked her back to her hotel room, and she didn't invite him in.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref> The next morning, he asked her out on a date. They went for dinner overlooking the river, where they talked about Meredith's new project.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith started officially working on the new project in Minnesota, she and Nick started dating. Meredith had trouble with the project's patient, Dr. David Hamilton, who is also on staff at Nick's hospital. Nick gave her advice on how to deal with Hamilton, and later that night, Meredith thanked Nick at dinner.<ref>[[Bottle Up and Explode!]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Nick and Meredith on a weekend getaway]]\nWhen Thanksgiving rolled around, Meredith was stuck in a hotel due to a snow storm. Nick was supposed to stay at his cabin, but when he heard that Meredith couldn't go home for the holidays, he turned around and joined her at her hotel. They ordered room service and spent the night before heading to his cabin the next day.<ref>[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]], x</ref>\n\nDuring one of her trips to Minnesota, Nick asked Meredith to help remove a tumor on one of his patients, but when things started to go wrong, Meredith found out that the patient was actually one of Nick's old friends, the one who had donated a kidney to Nick. She asked Nick to leave the OR because of the conflict of interest. They talked and made up after the surgery.<ref>[[Today Was a Fairytale]], x</ref> They kept dating, flying back and forth between Minnesota and Seattle to see each other. During one trip, Nick operated on a patient at Grey Sloan at Meredith's request, and afterwards, she introduced him to Maggie and Amelia.<ref>[[Living In a House Divided]], x</ref> After Meredith was offered a job in Minnesota, Nick offered that she stay and he move to Seattle to be with her. She started to get angry with him, claiming that she should be able to move and not be stuck at Grey Sloan. Because of the troubles with the teaching program at Grey Sloan, the two decided to stay for a couple weeks until the program was saved and then move to Minnesota.<ref>[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]], x</ref> \n\n\n[[Zola Grey Shepherd]]\n[[File:x-.png|thumb|xpx|Meredith bonds with Zola.]]\nMeredith and Derek met Zola when she was brought to the hospital for an operation as part of Alex's program. The couple had recently been told that Meredith had a hostile uterus and conceiving a child would be hard. Derek immediately bonded with Zola and suggested adoption. Meredith took a little longer to bond but eventually couldn't help falling in love with the child. However, Derek found out that Meredith tampered with his Alzheimer's trial just as the couple was granted temporary custody of Zola. When the social worker on their case, Janet, discovered that Meredith and Derek weren't living together, Zola was taken away from them for a time, during which Meredith and Derek rekindled their relationship. They were given a date to see a judge about the adoption after Alex went to the judge directly. That date was subsequently canceled and Janet told them that it was unlikely that it would end in their favor and suggested that they move on. Then, one night after a long day of work, Janet showed up at their door with Zola and told the couple that she was theirs.\n\n[[Derek Bailey Shepherd]]\nMeredith and Derek's son was a surprise to both because an OB/GYN had described Meredith's uterus as hostile. Meredith surprised Derek with a 'the world's best big sister' t-shirt for Zola to tell him she was pregnant. Meredith went into labor during the superstorm and had to have a C-section after injuring herself earlier from a fall on the stairs. With the lights out, Bailey performed the surgery, and to thank her, Derek and Meredith decided to name their son after her.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref> When Meredith visited her dad as he was dying, she told him Bailey said \"funny\" before saying something.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ellis Shepherd]]\nEllis was conceived before Derek's death. During her birth, Meredith was bleeding heavily. Zola called an ambulance, saving her. When Meredith visited her father before his death, she told him Ellis was really into hip-hop.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\n[[File:.Breakfeast.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith makes Lexie some breakfast.]]\nAlthough Meredith originally hated Lexie, she quickly realized that although she had reason to hate the idea of her, she had no reason to hate Lexie herself. Initially, she didn't like the way Lexie followed her around and seemed envious of her rapport with Derek. She claimed that Lexie was someone she never wanted to know, even denying that Lexie was her sister. However, after Bailey explained that Lexie probably thought she hated her, because of their family links, and after a traumatic day when Cristina brought Lexie home with her, Meredith made an effort to bond with her so they danced and drank tequila. The next morning, Meredith even tried to make breakfast for her and Lexie was so enthusiastic that she ate it, despite knowing she would have an allergic reaction. Lexie and Meredith didn't get too close, both having two different sets of friends, but they did eventually become friends which was made easier with the presence of [[George O'Malley]] who was good friends with both of them. Lexie gave up the apartment that she and George had rented, and moved into the attic of Meredith's house, where she occasionally bemoaned the fact that she didn\ut have a proper room instead. They later become so close, that Meredith gave Thatcher a piece of her liver because Lexie asked her to and she doesn\ut want her sister to feel the loss of her father, something of which she had experienced herself. She also sat with Lexie for  hours, after she has a PTSD breakdown and had to be committed to the psychiatric ward, against her will. And when Lexie got jealous over how April was all chummy with Meredith, she told her the reasons for that, and the fact that \"you're not crazy, you're a Grey and you're my sister, Lexie.\" At the end of Meredith's residency, Lexie died after the plane crash because she was stuck under the debris. Upon hearing of her death, Meredith cried hysterically.\n\nLater, Meredith obsessed over saving a patient's life when she had the same injuries as Lexie after being crushed by a car. At the end of the day, Meredith was talking to Cristina and simply said that \"Lexie's dead.\" From that, it appeared that Meredith had accepted the fact that Lexie was gone and was at peace.\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\n[[File:Ellissaysgoodbye.jpg|thumb|left|px|Ellis tells Meredith to be extraordinary.]]\n\nEllis Grey was the mother of Meredith Grey. Their relationship was strained due to Ellis's devotion to Richard Webber and her work, often forgetting about Meredith. Meredith was a rebellious teenager and she drank excessively and partied during college. However, while traveling in Europe, she received a call and was told that her mother had Alzheimer's. Meredith was made to look after Ellis and keep her secret from the rest who knew her. Ellis would rarely recognize Meredith but one day she woke up and was lucid, but it wouldn't last long, she found herself very disappointed in her daughter who was no longer driven, just \"happy.\" However, before she died, Meredith saw Ellis in a vision and Ellis hugged her and told her she was extraordinary and to continue being extraordinary. Later, Meredith found her mother's old diaries and used them to get to know who her mother was and she realized that she liked her and her mother was quite similar to her best friend, Cristina Yang.\n\n[[Thatcher Grey]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Thatcher apologizes to Lexie and Meredith.]]\nDue to Ellis and Richard's affair, Thatcher left Ellis and Meredith when Meredith was very young. Ellis asked him not to visit and Meredith did not see him again until she was in her thirties and she discovered he had another family. His wife Susan persisted in trying to get them to bond and they began to but when Susan died in surgery, Thatcher blamed Meredith, even going so far as to slap her across the face and asked her not to attend the funeral. Weeks later he arrived back at Seattle Grace and told her he was sorry and so proud of her but Lexie later informed her that he only said it because he was drunk and he did it all the time. Thatcher went into a program and he started making amends. He asked Meredith and Lexie to forgive him, Lexie hugged him and Meredith congratulated him and said good luck and then left the office they were in. Several months later, Thatcher came into Seattle Grace vomiting blood. He was found to have cirrhosis of the liver. He was told that to be put on the transplant list, he had to be sober for at least a year, but he had only been sober for  days. Lexie was not a match for her father's liver, but Meredith was. Willingly, she offers up her liver, not for Thatcher, but for Lexie's sake. Meredith then spent several weeks at home in bed, recovering from the transplant operation. When Thatcher quietly returned to the hospital, with bouts of pain, neither Grey knew, until Miranda Bailey informed them of his check-in. When he revealed that he had a young girlfriend, Meredith was actually happy for him and had to talk to Lexie, who was not too pleased with that discovery. Meredith later visited him in his house upon finding out he had less than a few days to live, and they talked until he passed away.\n\n[[Susan Grey]]\nSusan Grey was the second wife of Meredith's father, Thatcher. After Ellis Grey died, Susan reached out to Meredith and after a rough start, Susan and Meredith bonded. Susan would wash her clothes and make dinner for her and was like a surrogate mother to her. However, she came to Seattle Grace with the hiccups and she died during a relatively easy procedure, due to complications.\n\n[[Doc]]\n[[File:IzGeorgeMerDoc.jpg|thumb|right|px|Meredith and Izzie play with Doc.]]\nDoc was Derek, Addison, and Meredith's dog. She and Izzie rescued him from a shelter and brought him back to their home. Doc was very playful, but he became too much for Izzie and George who quickly demanded that he leave. Due to Meredith's friendship with Derek, Derek and Addison agreed to take him in. After taken to a vet, Doc was diagnosed with bone cancer. When his cancer spread, he was put down and Meredith and Derek agreed to bury him in his favorite spot on Derek's land. During her near-death experience, the very first being she wanted to meet was Doc.\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nMaggie is Meredith's half-sister, daughter of Ellis Grey and Richard Webber. She was adopted as a newborn and moved to Seattle and got a job at GSMH to know more about her biological mother, whom she only knew by name. Meredith and Maggie were immediately in conflict at work. Eventually, it came out that Maggie was Ellis' daughter. Initially, Meredith didn't believe it. The next day, Meredith, helped by Alex, matched the information about Maggie's birth with what she remembered and was able to access about Ellis' hospitalization, and she had to admit that Ellis Grey was actually Maggie's birth mother. After that, Meredith and Maggie ignored each other, but Derek pushed Meredith to make the first move with Maggie (like he had done for Lexie), so Meredith showed Maggie the old diaries of her mother that correspond to the period in which Maggie was conceived.  As time went on, Meredith and Maggie grew closer and now they have a good relationship.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAmelia is Meredith's sister-in-law through her marriage with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]. Their relationship has been rocky since Derek's death. Meredith finds Amelia annoying and doesn't really like her, but they both care for each other as a real family does. Amelia moved with Meredith to her old house after Meredith sold her and Derek's house. Despite a fall-out that resulted in Meredith kicking Amelia out of the house, Amelia continued to watch over her when Meredith was attacked. Meredith, in turn, was there for her wedding and supported her running away before the ceremony. When Amelia was diagnosed with a tumor, Meredith supported her and sat by her side in recovery, as Amelia had refused to call any of her family members. At the start of the pandemic, Amelia was on maternity leave with her son, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] and she and Link cared for Meredith's kids while Meredith worked and continued when Meredith contracted COVID.\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\n[[File:Persons.jpg|thumb|right|px|Cristina calls Meredith her person.]]\n\nCristina bonded with Meredith instantly and their relationship grew, resulting in Cristina and Meredith becoming best friends and each other's [[Person(s)|person]]. They were known around the hospital as the 'Twisted Sisters.' As such, there is very little that the two of them do not know, about the other, since day one of their internships. Meredith frequently talks about her problems with Derek, to her, and all the talk about her and Derek, have been a sore point with Cristina, at least a couple of times. She became Cristina's maid of honor during both weddings to Preston Burke and Owen Hunt. Meredith and Cristina also have several sleepovers at each other's houses, sometimes in Meredith's bed with Derek in it. As well as being one of Cristina's pillars of support, during when she suffered from PTSD, as a result of the shooting.\n\nThey bonded over a complex case on their first day, but the relationship was put to the test after Meredith was chosen for a surgery, instead of Cristina. However, they overcame the obstacle and their friendship grew. After Meredith and Derek's break-up, Cristina protected Meredith by asking Derek to stay away. Outside the hospital, they would hang out at Joe's bar, and in the hospital, they would help each other, wherever possible. Cristina was often there for Meredith during her worst times and vice versa. Meredith was the only person who knew about Cristina's pregnancy, and Cristina about Meredith's. When Addison came to Seattle Grace, Izzie and Cristina stole a patient from psych to make her feel better and when Meredith was put on Erica Hahn's service, Cristina selflessly gave Meredith lots of advice on how to impress Hahn.\n\n[[File:Old, new, borrowed, blue.jpg|thumb|px|left|Cristina gives Meredith something old, new, borrowed and blue for her wedding.]]\n\nThey had their first big fight after Richard Webber blamed Cristina for knowing of the interns' secret meetings and Meredith did not defend her. Although Meredith at first refused to believe Cristina was ignoring her, she eventually accepted it. The two spoke to each other as little as possible, and when they did, they would argue with each other, Meredith even insulted Cristina by saying that to some people things came naturally, but Cristina was one of the people that had to practice. However, after Meredith broke down after attending the execution of a murderer, Derek brought her to Cristina and they made up. They began to bond over [[Ellis Grey's Journals|Meredith's mother's old diaries]] and Meredith found herself comparing Cristina to her mother. When Meredith announced her own wedding, she chose Cristina as her maid of honor.\n\nAfter a fight with Owen, Cristina showed up at Meredith's house. They laid on the floor and talked about her problems. When Owen came to Meredith's house looking for Cristina, Meredith said, \"I already fixed her.\" And Cristina went home with Owen. Also, when both of their husbands were angry with them, Derek at Meredith for tampering with his clinical trial and Owen at Cristina for wanting an abortion, they leaned on each other. Cristina stayed at Meredith's house, both of the men away, and helped take care of baby Zola. They would sleep in the same bed and have routines in the morning.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\n[[File:GeorgeMerSTimeOut.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Meredith apologize during a time-out.]]\n\nFrom the moment [[George O'Malley]] met Meredith, he fell in love with her. Meredith however, was in love with Derek Shepherd so she never really thought about George as more than a friend. Only a patient and George's best friend [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] knew how he felt about Meredith. After a small push from Izzie, George decided to tell Meredith how he felt. Meredith had had a very bad day at work so when George confessed his feelings for her, she thought that maybe George was her guy and she had just overlooked him. They proceeded to kiss but during sex, knowing it wasn't right, Meredith burst into tears. George was humiliated and furious and for weeks, he refused to speak to her. Eventually, he accepted her apology, but admitted that he was partly to blame too, he had known how she felt about Derek and knew that she didn't love George. Their friendship continued and he moved back to her house. When George discovered that he had to repeat his intern year, he drew away from his group of friends, but things soon went back to normal. Meredith and George's friendship continued and was strengthened, as she was his resident. On George's last day at Seattle Grace, he was hit by a bus after pushing [[Amanda]] out of its path. When he was admitted, nobody could recognize him. Meredith was his doctor and she defended him in front of some of the other doctors. After he traced \"[[]]\" on her hand, she realized it was him and had him rushed into the [[Operating Room|O.R.]] George later died, and she and the other doctors at Seattle Grace attended his funeral. As the janitor cleaned out George's cubby, as they \"need(ed) space,\" Meredith realized that what had happened was real and broke down in Derek's arms.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\n[[File:MerIzCristinax.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith gives Izzie her wedding.]]\nMeredith formed a close bond with Izzie on their first day and her relationship with Izzie grew more so when Izzie and George moved in with her. Initially, Izzie was not pleased to know that Meredith was in a relationship with Derek, as she felt that Derek would be favoring her over the other interns, and thus giving her a much better career prospect. She finally learned that Meredith actually loved Derek, and it was not a fling. When George and Meredith were fighting, Izzie told Meredith she would be siding with George if they had to choose sides but fortunately, Meredith and George's issues were soon resolved. Izzie felt close enough to talk to Meredith about her relationship with George and how he pecked her like a chicken and when she discovered that Izzie and George were dating, she supported them. After Izzie was diagnosed with cancer, and when the condition relapsed and Meredith was informed, she and Derek gave their wedding to Alex and Izzie. However, after Izzie left Seattle Grace when she was fired prior to the merger with Mercy West, Izzie refused to answer calls from any of her friends and only returned when a former teacher of hers was sick and sought Derek's help at Seattle Grace. She returned later on after Meredith called her and told her Alex might be moving on, the same night that Alex slept with Lexie. Meredith decided that they should keep it between the three of them. Later that night, Meredith found Izzie cleaning out her old room, ready to leave for good after Alex dumped her. Meredith begged her to stay because this was her home, but Izzie told her that it wasn't. It was just a place she worked at and she could find a new workplace. Meredith was left speechless and walked away.\n\n[[Alex Karev]] \n[[File:AlexMeredithThanksfortheMemories.jpg|thumb|right|px|Alex and Meredith talk.]]\nInitially, Meredith disliked Alex, after he insulted her on the first day of her internship, by calling her a nurse. But when he became Bailey's intern and Izzie made friends with him, Meredith gradually lessened her dislike of Alex. After discovering that Alex failed his board exams, Meredith helped him to study and they occasionally have heartfelt and meaningful conversations. When Izzie was revealed to be quite sick, Meredith offered her wedding to Izzie and Alex and Alex made her his best man for the wedding. When Izzie left the hospital after being fired, Meredith became a source of support. She rang Izzie to tell her to come back because Alex might be moving on, after witnessing Alex and Reed flirting and the next morning she found Lexie and Alex in bed together but advised them to keep it secret. There is no sexual attraction between the two, as shown when Meredith sits in the bathroom and has a girl talk with Alex. while he is in the shower. When Derek walks in and looks at the two of them, she explains by saying he's being a girl for her right now.\n\nHowever, that friendship may have run its course, seeing as how he had sold her out, while in a drunken stupor, to Owen Hunt, while the residents were all in the race for Chief Resident. Meredith subsequently confronted him, in a fit of anger, telling him that she probably will get fired and that she wanted him out of the house by the end of the day. And while he was actually updating the adoption agent, on the medical status of Zola, Meredith had the misconception that Alex was trying to ruin her chances of adopting the child.\n\nHowever, it appeared that with Alex's apology, they mended their fences and went back to their former relationship, as he was there to provide some physical support after Meredith learned that Zola had to be surrendered to Social Services for the time being. Cristina told Alex to help Meredith with trying to keep Zola from being taken from her because Meredith was the only one who \"gave a rat's ass\" about Alex. Alex also spilled to Cristina that she and Meredith were all he had and that they were his family, and that realization made him help Meredith and attempt to get Social Services to let Meredith keep Zola. With the departure of Cristina, Alex became Meredith's new \"person\" and the closest thing to a brother she had.\n\nAfter the death of Derek, Meredith left Seattle without telling anyone where she was going. Despite numerous calls from Alex, she refused to answer. She eventually FaceTimed him, saying that she and the kids were fine and she wished he would stop calling. When she later gave birth to [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], there was a problem and he was her emergency contact person, so the hospital called him and he came to San Diego to see her.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMeredith and Mark first met when Mark came to Seattle Grace to work on a patient. Mark didn't know that Meredith ''was'' Meredith and flirted with her and and soon as Derek saw, he punched him in the face. Mark and Meredith started talking about their problems as their common factors were that they were the Dirty Mistresses of Derek and Addison.\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Sadie returns to Seattle to Meredith.]]\nSadie Harris was Meredith's best friend and she too hated Ellis. Following her graduation from college, when Meredith was in her twenties, she left to go traveling around Europe for two months with Sadie where they partied and drank frequently and experienced some of the adventures of \"Death and Die.\" They had a big fight in Amsterdam, and though they made up and stayed friends, their friendship never truly recovered and they were never as close again. When Meredith received a call about her mother, she left Europe and went back to Seattle. Years later, Sadie made a surprise visit to Meredith's house and became an intern at Seattle Grace. Sadie and Meredith picked up their friendship as though no time had passed, causing Cristina to be extremely jealous. However, when George alerted the chief that Sadie did not seem to have much medical knowledge, she quit and asked Meredith to leave with her. But Meredith said she had a life now and could no longer be sleeping her way through Europe. Sadie told Meredith that the hospital had changed her, but the latter replies that wasn't true: it simply changed what she wanted, and now she wanted to stay in Seattle Grace. Then Sadie left.\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nJackson moved to Seattle Grace through the merger with Mercy West. At first, Meredith did not like Jackson very much. Later, when she found out he was related to Harper Avery, she felt empathy for him. They became friends because she knows what it feels like to have a famous relative. Jackson and Meredith have developed a nice friendship and they are usually nice and happy around each other.\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nWhen April first came to Seattle Grace, Meredith did not approve of her. When April came back after being fired, Meredith liked her even less, because she was way too friendly to Derek. Later, when Derek got shot, Meredith said that April didn't have the right to cry because of Derek, but she told Meredith that Reed, her best friend died. Meredith ended up comforting April, creating a bond. Later, Meredith let April and Jackson move into her house, and she admitted to liking April more and more, after she went off on a tirade, after being continually teased for being a virgin the whole day. Meredith and April appeared to have a relatively friendly relationship, with April often turning to Meredith for advice, and Meredith genuinely being kind to her.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n[[File:CallieClaimsMeredith'sPanties.jpg|thumb|right|px|Callie claims Meredith's panties to protect her.]]\nAlthough Callie and Meredith were friends, they were never great friends. Meredith allowed Callie to move into her house for a while and Callie saved her from embarrassment at work and gave her advice about her dog, but Meredith was better friends with Izzie, who disliked Callie, so she often sided with Izzie in arguments. After George and Callie divorced, Callie moved in with Meredith's best friend, Cristina, so she and Callie bonded a bit more and both of them protected her from Owen Hunt when they thought he might hurt Cristina, after he choked her, while he was asleep. Callie played a big part of Meredith's career at the end of her residency, helping her study for the surgical boards that all th years take, helping Meredith pass. Callie and Meredith also have the common bond of being mothers, which has helped their friendship a great deal. Meredith also helped Callie with her separation from Arizona, the custody hearing, and even comforted her after she lost sole custody of Sofia to Arizona.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\n[[File:RichardandMeredithForgiveEachOther.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Richard forgive each other.]]\nMeredith Grey and [[Richard Webber]] had a very strained relationship for a very long time. He was the main cause of her parents' divorce and because of him, she was always cast aside. Upon coming to Seattle Grace, they acted civilly, but there were issues under the surface. Because he had been so close to Ellis, he felt close to Meredith, and he was close to her as a child and she thought that he thought he was her father. After she started disregarding his authority, Richard realized that although he was not a bad man, he was the bad man in her story. Richard started becoming frustrated with Meredith and even more so when he looked at her and was frustrated to see [[Ellis Grey]] inside her, the woman whom he loved but had almost ruined his marriage. He never looked Meredith in the eye and eventually, Derek Shepherd spoke to them both. He told Richard that he was the most professional man except for when it came to Meredith Grey, who he didn't always treat as a colleague. Richard apologized to Meredith for his actions in the past, he had been aware that she had grown up alone but never tried to stop it. The two forgave each other and it was proven by his fatherly behavior towards her during her solo surgery and her offering him the diaries of her mother. Meredith later tells a shooter that he should kill her because she is the closest thing Richard has to a daughter. Most of the doctors in the hospital acknowledge Richard and Meredith's relationship, often getting her to use her dead mommy connections to get something.\n\nMeredith also helped get Richard and Catherine back together after their fight.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nMeredith and Owen have had a turbulent relationship, as they have often clashed over Cristina, whom they both care about very much. In the beginning, Meredith was supportive of Owen and Cristina's relationship, but after he strangled Cristina during a PTSD nightmare, she gave him the cold shoulder and kept him away from Cristina. After they got back together, she was civil to Owen for Cristina's sake, although the two shared a few arguments over how to handle Cristina, as Meredith claimed to know her better than Owen did. The cold peace between them finally came to a stop when Meredith learned that he had cheated on Cristina, which resulted in her despising him for a long time. However, Cristina made her accept that she would decide her fate with Owen herself, and Meredith would just have to deal with it. Afterward, her relationship with Owen got better, and upon Cristina's departure, she considered Owen as her friend and promised to be his person for Cristina. That promise soon came to use, as Nathan Riggs' arrival to the hospital caused Owen to become moody and isolated, prompting a worried Meredith to turn to his mother, who revealed her the truth behind Owen's mood.\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nWhen Meredith was publishing her abdominal wall transplant, she wanted to put Jo's name on the paper, but she also needed a picture, and Jo couldn't give a picture because then [[Paul Stadler|Paul]] would find her, so she asked Meredith to take her name off of the article. From that point on, Meredith was very protective of Jo and was even nice to her when [[Alex Karev|Alex]] asked. Then when Paul surprised Jo at the hospital, Meredith was there to comfort her and to keep her safe from Paul. She comforted her by saying \"You're Jo Wilson. I know exactly who you are.\" Meredith kept Alex from Paul, so Alex didn't kill him, and Meredith sat with Jo while she was signing the divorce papers. She also protected her when Paul came back and was threatening Jo for talking to Jenny, Meredith \"called security\" even though the phones weren't working. After that, when Meredith was dealing with the mini spleens in [[Judy Kemp]], Jo wished that a mini-spleen situation would happen for a useful organ, which gave Meredith the idea for her contest entry: mini livers. Since Jo helped find an important piece, she put Jo as her partner for the contest, and they created their mini livers together. After Jo's return to the hospital, Meredith has taken on a sisterly role to Jo, helping her out whenever she needs help.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\n[[File:IntoYouLikeATrainMerBailey.jpg|thumb|left|px|Bailey addresses a drunken Meredith.]]\nBailey was Meredith's resident and had earned the nicknamed \"The Nazi\" before Meredith had started at Seattle Grace. She rarely got involved with people and their problems, unless it affected their work. When [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] found out about Derek and Meredith's relationship, she didn't speak to Meredith and would punish her, by sending her nonsurgical tasks, to even up the playing field when she felt that Derek was favoring her. However, after their break-up, when Derek tried to talk to Meredith, Bailey grew protective and told him not to, that Meredith was hurt and he would just make it worse. Bailey taught Meredith and the interns with a tough-love method. And as the interns became residents, Bailey became friendlier to them, often dispensing advice and chastisement when needed, while still managing to maintain her fearsome professional reputation as a doctor and general surgeon. She attends Derek and Meredith's Christmas dinner to impress her father, and shows a motherly protection over Meredith.\n\nHowever, upon learning of Meredith's tampering with Derek's trial, she voices her strong disapproval of her, as evidenced from her interactions with Meredith, when she got fired, and the Chief, when asked to write a recommendation letter for her.\n\nWhen a storm hit the city, Meredith went into labor and had started bleeding internally after giving birth. All of the surgeons were busy except for Bailey, who at the time was not operating because of her recent MRSA scare, but ultimately decided to save Meredith. Meredith's baby was named after Bailey.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\n[[File:AddisonhugsMeredithx.jpg|thumb|right|px|Addison hugs Meredith.]]\nWhen Addison came to Seattle Grace although she wanted Derek back, she was civil to Meredith and even defended her in front of a mislead patient. In a scrub room, Addison told Meredith that if there was even a chance that Derek still loved her then she wasn't leaving Seattle but she would if he didn't. Derek chose Addison over Meredith, but when Derek and Meredith decided to be friends, Addison tried to be friends with her, too. The three stayed friends, even taking in Meredith's dog, but Addison sometimes felt a tension between the two and realized that everybody knew Derek loved Meredith, except for Derek and Meredith. She and Derek eventually divorced but after a short while, she managed to have a friendship with both of them. The relationship was proven when she came back to Seattle for a visit and hugged Meredith, although she was quite annoyed, and quite tempted to kick her ass physically, after learning that Meredith was letting Derek go off with Rose.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhen Mark first met Meredith, he flirted with her and was punched in the face by Derek. Privately, she labeled him as \ucMcSteamy\ud, and Mark called her \"My Favorite Dirty Mistress,\" while she was high on morphine for pain management. But when he asked her out, she said no because she loved Derek. When Derek forgave Mark for breaking up his marriage and they resumed their friendship with him, Meredith too became friendly towards him, although Mark still threatened her, only half-jokingly, on her wedding day. He later dated her little sister against her wishes, which caused a fight between him and Derek. When the plane crashed and killed Lexie, both she and Mark were left shocked and distraught with Meredith crying hysterically and a depressed Mark had a heart complication.\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\nBecause Burke was dating Cristina, Meredith and Derek were often invited over to their house for dinner and vice versa. She tried to mediate and fix things between Cristina and Burke, after Cristina went to Chief Webber about the tremor in Burke's hand, but to no avail. However, Burke left Cristina on the day of their wedding and there was never any contact between them again.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\nWhen Erica Hahn was hired at Seattle Grace, she almost immediately assigned Meredith to her service in order to see if Meredith had any of her mother's skill. She was impressed by Meredith but when Meredith lied and said she had performed a certain surgery when she hadn't, Hahn told her that if she did it again, she'd never let her operate in her OR again.\n\n\nAfter attending medical school, Meredith secured a spot at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] as a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] and moved from Boston to her mother's house in Seattle. She attended [[Dartmouth College]].\n\nBecause of her mother's reputation, Meredith was often treated differently from other doctors, sometimes favored and sometimes disliked. Meredith showed promise as an intern, she made a difficult diagnosis on her first day and during the rest of her internship, she assisted in several advanced procedures, particularly [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] cases.\n\nAfter correctly diagnosing a patient with a brain tumor, she approached Derek Shepherd with the idea of a clinical trial. On their thirteenth patient, they had a success and the clinical trial was published in a medical journal and named ''The Shepherd Method''. But she was not too pleased, to find that she was not mentioned in the article and was somewhat upset to hear from Derek that he was the one taking the risk, despite her doing all the work.\n\nSoon after, Meredith discovered numerous journals belonging to her mother, while she learned more about her and also picked up some surgical skills and even a doll from her past, Anatomy Jane, which helped her save a young girl.\n\nOn her wedding day, she was given a colon removal operation, from Derek, as her first solo surgery, as a wedding present. Without any intervention from other doctors, she successfully completed the surgery, despite Richard and Mark observing in the background. Richard Webber informed her that her mother would have been proud, while Meredith said that her mother was likely to have been glad that she didn't kill anyone instead.\n\nShe later also performed a solo neurological surgery by herself, as Derek, the attending doctor, was occupied by another patient in another OR. When Derek was setting up the Alzheimer's trial, Meredith was there to assist him. But she was not entirely pleased to find out that he chose Alex, over her, to help him. It was only later, that Alex explained that Meredith was more suited to be his assistant, as she had personal experience, in dealing with the patients and family. But when she tampered with the sample that Adele was supposed to get, Alex suspected that something was amiss. That culminated in him outing her, while he was drunk, and her being suspended, before being fired by the board. Richard took the fall for her, but she and Derek agreed that they shouldn't be close at work too, so Meredith decided to leave neurosurgery.\n\nElecting [[General Surgery|general surgery]] as her [[Surgery#Surgical Specialties|specialty]], Meredith passed the [[Board Certification|boards]] and is now the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[General Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. \n\nShe is also one of the Board Directors at Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\n\n*Meredith's Catch Phrases/Running Gags:\n**.
