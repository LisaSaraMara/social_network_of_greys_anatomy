Jackson consulted with Aamir, who asked Jackson to do what he needed to do to keep Rafi alive. They planned to remove his scapula in its entirety, which would leave him with limited function in his arms. However, while they were operating, Jackson had the idea to take the removed scapulae and perform extracorporeal irradiation to kill the cancer without killing Rafi.

They all agreed that Matthew was a dreamboat, but when Jackson came in, they started fawning over for him, questioning if he was, \"''the'' Jackson.\" April dodged their questions and asked Matthew to take her sisters back to her apartment while she answered a page from the hospital. Her sisters instead insisted that they wanted to go with her.\n\n\nThe three of them went to the hospital with April, where she gave them a quick tour. On the tour, they met [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], whom Kimmie said was very brave because of her amputation. Jackson and Matthew then came in with a patient, on whom Matthew had performed an incorrect tracheotomy. April sent him away with her sisters.\n\n\nAfter being sent away from the trauma, Kimmie, Libby, and Alice planned the rest of April's bridal shower. The next day, they brought the supplies to the hospital and were upset to learn that April was in surgery and might not make it to the shower. When she finally did show up at the party, April started opening gifts. One of the gifts was a thong, which April mistakenly opened in front of everyone. When they picked on her for her lack of experience, she confessed that she'd had sex before, which shocked them. She then fired them as her bridesmaids and hired Arizona, Meredith, and Cristina to replace them. ''(\"[[Man on the Moon]]\")''\n\n\nAlice and her sisters were angry that April \"fired\" them as her bridesmaids and chose\ua[[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]],\ua[[Meredith Grey|Meredith]],\uaand\ua[[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]\uato be her bridesmaids instead. Despite their anger, they did attend the wedding, where they angrily looked at their sister's bridesmaids.

After surviving a near-fatal accident, she resigned from Grey Sloan to help the unhoused who need medical care. She was married to [[Jackson Avery]], with whom she has a deceased son, [[Samuel Norbert Avery|Samuel]], and a daughter, [[Harriet Kepner-Avery]]. She later married her former fianc\ue [[Matthew Taylor]], though the marriage was short-lived. After their split, she ended up moving to Boston with Jackson and their daughter, where the two rekindled their relationship.\n\n\n\nMuch of April's personal life was revealed while she was being held at gunpoint by [[Gary Clark]]. She was forced to tell him personal details about herself in an attempt to prevent him from shooting her. She revealed that she was born on April rd in Columbus, Ohio and was raised on a corn farm in Moline, Ohio along with three sisters, a pet pony, and a pet duck. Her mother is a teacher, while her father stays home and tends to the farm.\n\nWhen April told her parents she wanted to become a doctor, they were \"over the moon\" about it. April has always been very focused on her studies, so other than medical school and various church-related events, she hasn't done much.\n\n\nApril was matched up with [[Lexie Grey]] on her first day at the newly-merged [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. Lexie at first was very mean to her but reconciled with her as she felt bad.<ref>[[Invasion]], x</ref> April was fired shortly after the merger after a mass hotel fire brought an overflow of patients into the ER. Her patient didn't need surgery, but because of a distraction in the ER, April forgot to check down her patient's airway, which was filled with soot. Her patient couldn't breathe and went into cardiac arrest after many hours thinking she was fine aside from some burns. The Chief interrogated all the doctors on duty and eventually fired April, as she was behind the death.<ref>[[I Saw What I Saw]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen [[Derek Shepherd]] became Chief of Surgery, he rehired April, because he thought she deserved a second chance. April admired his abilities and knowledge in his field of work. She had a small work crush on him but nothing developed between them because  Derek's invested in his relationship with Meredith. For a while, she tended to do more administrative work than medicine, in fear of killing someone again. A push from Derek got her to do surgery again.\n\n\nApril lost her best friend, [[Reed Adamson]], the first victim of the shooting. She ran to Derek Shepherd's office and told him what happened. April was right in front of the shooter when he shot Derek, and she told him her life story, stating she hasn't lived yet, nobody had loved her, and the shooter told her to run. She seemed to deal with Reed's loss alone after the shooting.\n\n\nApril is of Christian faith and always prays for her patients before going into surgery. Although elements of her Christianity are traditionally conservative, she is very open-minded \u as she is seen attending [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona's]] wedding, and even dancing and taking pictures of the newlyweds during the reception. She has an extremely close relationship with God and remained a virgin until she was  for this reason.\n\nApril kept her relationship with God a secret from her fellow doctors because she feared they would see her as less of a surgeon because of it. However, when she lost her virginity to [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] the night before her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical boards]], she re-evaluated her faith and stopped caring what others thought about it.\n\n\nShortly after they got back to the hospital after taking their boards, the residents all checked to see if they passed. They all passed except April.<ref>[[Let the Bad Times Roll]], x</ref> She shut down and all the hospitals that offered her a fellowship were now retracting their offers. Her last offer standing was Seattle Grace, but that was also rescinded, leaving her with no place left.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref> She ended up moving back to her parents' and working on their farm until Owen came to get her and take her back to the hospital.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n\nJackson once again said she was getting married. \"Unless I'm not,\" she replied, still asking him to give her a reason not to. When Stephanie came in and started comforting Jackson, April left. While operating on a firefighter who got hurt due to the mudslide caused by the storm, Owen asked April if she said yes to Matthew, whom he helped to prepare the proposal. April said she did, and Owen approved of this, as all first responders are good guys. While her patient's wife said goodbye to her deceased husband, April watched Jackson take his patient to surgery.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nJackson asked April to scrub in with him on a surgery as the interns weren't working due to [[Heather Brooks|Heather's]] death. Suddenly a crying Stephanie appeared and hugged Jackson. April's disappointed look was noticed by Matthew, who then went outside to head back out to the mudslide again. April joined him in the ambulance bay, where he told her that he understood that she wanted Jackson and that he didn't give her a chance to say no because he proposed in front of all these people. He said she wanted to say no. She didn't object to this, and he angrily got in his ambulance and drove off. She scrubbed in with Jackson and tried to talk to him during the surgery, but he snapped at her every time. When they told [[Sasha (Season )|the patient]] and [[Brian (Season )|her fianc\ue]] that her organs were failing and the powerful antibiotics may not work, the couple decided they wanted to get married immediately. As she and Jackson couldn't find any chaplain in the hospital, Jackson got certified online and officiated the wedding. His words touched April, and she tried to talk to him about the wedding afterward. He snapped again, and she asked why he did. She apologized for having asked the question and said there was no need to beat a dead horse. He said that she didn't want him when he wanted her, and she only wanted him now because she was scared by the real relationship she was in. He told her to make up her mind about whether or not she wanted to make a life with Matthew or not. \"None of this has to do with me. This is entirely about you,\" Jackson said, indicating he had no more interest in her. April did make up her mind and dragged Matthew to the hospital's chapel to accept his proposal in private, without pressure. She then proposed to him and clarified that she did have feelings for Jackson and that it got confusing sometimes. She said she never thought that anybody would ever want her with her difficult personality, but that she really wanted him. \"I want to marry you. So will you marry me?\" she asked, after which he took her in his arms and kissed her.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Matthew proposes to April]]\nA few days after having retaken her boards, April was still anxiously waiting to hear about the result. Jackson thought she would pass, and she joked that if she didn't, they'd know it wasn't his fault that she didn't pass the previous year. Callie made her even more nervous with some snappy comments. After surgery, she started thinking that she really didn't pass and they just didn't inform her because it was the second time she failed. Suddenly she got a message, and too nervous to read it herself, she gave her phone to Jackson. He read that she passed, and she delightedly cheered. They gave each other an awkward high five. \"Like you said, it's all you,\" Jackson said. This touched both of them, and they went their separate ways while thinking about what he said.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nAfter finishing up in the ER, April dressed up for the gala. When she got to the party, Jackson begged her to go back to the hospital and grab cooling blankets to cool the champagne, and she obeyed. In the supply closet, April found a crying Arizona, but she pretended to be fine. April returned to the gala, where she heard Callie was telling everyone Arizona had died in the plane crash. She then decided to be a good friend and returned to Arizona with two bottles of champagne. Arizona told April how she felt about everyone judging and staring at her for being a cheater and explained why she cheated. April said she could empathize with others, even though others seemed to think she couldn't because she goes to church. They continued talking about their problems while getting drunker, and April mentioned forgiveness is important and that both Jesus and Matthew see her for who she is and accept her even with what she's done. They ordered Leah to get more champagne and snacks. When they got totally drunk, April and Arizona agreed they had been in need of having fun. April then bluntly asked to try on Arizona's leg, which made them both laugh. At the end of the evening, Leah helped April and Arizona get in a cab to bring them home. April called shotgun to sit in the front as she gets carsick in the back, but she had been drinking so much that she got carsick in the front too.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nSome time after the gala, Arizona was offered coffee by Leah. She questioned what she did to deserve that, but they both don't remember anything about that night. Arizona was afraid she may have slept with Leah. April said she woke up the next morning in the bathtub with her Spanx still on, so they knew that nothing like that had happened to her. In surgery, Owen and Callie were discussing whether or not Emma was his girlfriend for having baked banana bread for. April said that Matthew brought her breakfast burritos and now they were getting married. \"Just saying,\" she said when Owen gave her a look. She defended Arizona when Callie started thinking about kicking Arizona out of their apartment, saying Arizona needed the elevator and that the apartment was handicap accessible. She explained that she and Arizona drunk three bottles of champagne and puked together, which made them bond.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, April and Jackson treated a man who believed he was bitten by a \"zombie\" and believed that he was becoming a zombie now too. In surgery, Jackson got texts from a panicking Stephanie and he told a nurse what to reply. April noticed how sweet his reply was and said he was never that nice to her when she would spin up. He replied he was trying to be a better boyfriend now, but April said that his behavior to her had helped her to get her act together. She said she was getting married, and Jackson joked that was all because of him. After surgery, April showed Jackson how she shuts down someone who's spinning out of control by calming down their patient. In the evening, Matthew organized a Halloween party and April went there dressed as a Velveteen bunny.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nAs a preparation for their wedding, Matthew and April took a compatibility test at their church, on which they scored %. While their reverend was getting their exercises for the next week, Matthew wanted to discuss an important area of their relationship where they are compatible, but not equal. They both wanted to take care of it before the wedding, but they didn't know they were talking about different things. Just as April said they should get a joint checking account, Matthew proposed to have sex. April later turned to Arizona for advice on the sex issue, but Arizona can only say that her sex with Leah is awesome, making April leave in frustration. She went to Matthew in the ambulance bay, and told him she wanted them to commit to one another before having sex, as she wanted their first time on their wedding night to be amazing. Matthew pointed out that he thought that God already knew that he would love her for the rest of his life, and April then remembered that their reverend told them to support one another, so she agreed to have sex if it was so important for him, which it was. However, in the evening, April remember how she lost herself after having lost her virginity, and she stated that she loved and respected him too much to see him stumble the way she did. She said their first time would be amazing, and if they would have their first time now, he only would have broken a promise, which she didn't want to do to him. They then agreed to wait until their wedding night and lean on each other for support until then, after which they started kissing and hugging.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\nA couple of days later, April started asking her colleagues' mail addresses to send them invitations to her wedding. All of the guests are allowed to bring a plus one. Stephanie found it out that she was getting an invitation and was allowed to bring a plus one, as she thought Jackson would get an invitation too. She talked to Jackson about this, who then went to April to ask her if she knew he and Stephanie were serious. She did, and then explained why Stephanie received an invitation too. Jackson wasn't getting an invitation, as Matthew didn't want to invite him, but April figured that he would come as Stephanie's plus one. Jackson questioned why he should come to the wedding if sending an invitation is already causing problems for Matthew. April replied he had to come because he was her friend and she wanted him there. He replied he wanted to come, and she then asked for their blessing. Without it, she wouldn't be able to go through with it. He gave her his blessing, but still wasn't sure he would be at the wedding.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref> Jackson went to the wedding as Stephanie's plus one. Near the end of the ceremony, Jackson stood up and declared his love for April.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref> Jackson and April ran out of the church, leaving Matthew at the alter and eloped themselves.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter treating a patient with deaf parents, Jackson and April realized that they had completely different ideas on how to raise their kids. April felt like Jackson wouldn't respect the religious traditions she wanted to teach her kids, and they got into a huge fight. April temporarily moved in with Callie and Arizona, feeling this fight would already end their marriage. When she went home to pick up her iPod, Jackson asked her to end their fight, as the children they were discussing were hypothetical after all. April then revealed they weren't hypothetical anymore, as she was pregnant accidentally.\n\nDuring their first ultrasound, things were awkward as they didn't know how to behave because of their fight. They were sure they didn't want to terminate the pregnancy, and both April and Jackson were happy about the pregnancy. Their discussion was resolved when Jackson decided he'd accompany his wife and children to church, as he felt that was really important for his wife. They planned on waiting to share the pregnancy with their families until after the first trimester, but when Callie and Stephanie accidentally found out, they decided it wasn't necessary to keep the pregnancy a secret and they shared it with their colleagues and family. A possible terrorist attack made April insecure about bringing a child into the evil world, but Catherine told her that there's only one way to change that world: good people raising their babies right. That calmed April down and gave her confidence that she would raise the baby right.\n\nWhen April's mother visited for the first time, April found that her mother meddled too much. Her mother and Jackson decorated the entire nursery, making her feel left out. April mother's told her that she didn't want to take anything from April at all. She was very proud of April when she saw her in her natural environment, the hospital, although she didn't understand a thing from what April does all day. However, she does know a lot about raising babies, so that's why she wanted to help. April then realized she had acted wrong and apologized to her mother, promising her to call her when she needed more help. She went home to Jackson. They agreed she was a jerk. She told Jackson he'd be a great dad, visibly looking forward to welcoming their baby in the new nursery.\n\nApril and Jackson decided to keep the sex of the baby a surprise as April wanted it to be. After losing a pregnant patient in the OR, April was a little shocked, but she was faithful that everything would turn out right for her, as it was all in God's hands. During a routine ultrasound, Stephanie accidentally revealed to April that the baby was a boy. Unbeknownst to April, she found out there was something wrong with the baby. Jackson found out when Herman and Stephanie were talking about this, so he was the one to deliver the news to April. Unable to deal with it just yet, April dove into work in the busy ER and avoided talking about it, although she lashed out at Stephanie for telling other people about the baby's diagnosis before telling her. After having treated every possible patient, April and Jackson talked. April researched the disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, and found out about the different types of the disease, although she didn't want to know what type their son had. April had difficulties understanding why God would do this to her, as she'd always done everything right for Him. When she finally informed Jackson that they were having a boy, she fell apart and cried in his arms.\n\nAs Jackson wanted to know everything they could get to know, they ran a test to find out what type their baby was suffering from. However the results would turn out, she wanted to keep the baby, loving and holding him as long as possible. Her mother came over and they spent the day at church. At home, Jackson and Karen started arguing over whether or not the test results were necessary. April stopped the fighting and yelled that their different opinions weren't helping her at all, actually only making her more sad, scared and feeling alone. After comforting each other all night, April and Jackson discussed the test results with Herman.\n\nTheir baby was diagnosed with type II, meaning he'd die minutes or hours after birth. His bones were breaking inside the womb, devastating April. Jackson and April worked out a plan with Catherine, inducing labor and cherishing and baptizing the baby before their son would pass away. They had a difficult moment when Herman pushed the paperwork onto them, including a death certificate. April didn't want to sign it yet, but she did want to continue with the plan. However, right before inducing, April decided she couldn't do it yet, because they hadn't figured out a name yet and mostly because she was still hoping for a miracle, and she returned to the ER to work. There, she helped a grieving woman work through her fianc\ue's death. While comforting the woman, April reconnected with God and found her faith again, assuring the woman she was strong enough to get through this, indirectly also talking to herself with God's words. This encounter made April feel ready and she and Jackson settled on naming their son Samuel Norbert Avery. Moments later, the labor was induced. Herman delivered the baby and April and Jackson cherished him in their arms. A priest came to baptize the baby and Samuel squeezed April's finger, letting go shortly after. Not long after, Samuel passed away. Jackson took his wife home while both remembering significant events from their lives as a couple.\n[[File:xSamuelbirth.png|thumb|xpx|April gives birth to Samuel Norbert Avery]]\nApril and Jackson asked everyone for privacy. April felt sad and angry about God and the baby and needed space and time to herself to deal with these feelings. She first returned to the hospital when Dr. Herman had her brain tumor removed, as April wanted to be with Herman on her worst day like Herman had done for her. She later returned to work in the ER.\n\nApril was still hurt about losing Samuel and made the decision to go work with Dr. Hunt in a war zone. She initially would be gone for three months but kept postponing her return, upsetting Jackson. She returned almost a year later, appearing more confident but also more distant. Jackson blamed Dr. Hunt for changing her.\n\nLater on, she was offered another chance to go to Jordan as a field surgeon. After an explosion in the tunnels, April realized that she needed to go back because it was what she loved. Jackson felt like she was abandoning him again when he needed her the most so he offered her an ultimatum. If she chooses to leave, he told her that he wasn't sure that he could be there when she came back. April knew it was her calling to go back to Jordan and she left. Regretful about his ultimatum, Jackson bought a ticket on the same flight as April but realized he was too late and missed the flight. \n\nWhen April returned for the second time, she was met with hostility by Jackson because he felt that she was never there when he needed her and only believed that she was hurting when he was suffering too. She had left him when what he needed to survive was her. She continued to push Jackson to rethink their marriage and they decided to try couples therapy after Jackson professed that he wanted her. But they recognized that they were divided beyond repair, agreed to divorce. \n\nOn the day of the divorce signing, April and Jackson look at their relationship over the last + years. April asks a tearful Jackson if he really wants this and eventually signs the papers and leaves immediately with tears streaming down her face. After the signing, Arizona offered alcohol to April and then joked around, asking if she was pregnant when she refused a drink. April responded saying that she was.<ref name=\":\">[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref>\n\nApril and Jackson went out for dinner and discussed plans for their baby. Jackson said he wanted to be in the room for the birth and April replied that she wanted him there. After, they discussed holiday plans. April would be with the child for Easter and Jackson would have the Super Bowl and Halloween. They decided to switch off every year for Christmas.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn the day of [[Owen and Amelia's Wedding]], April went back to Meredith's house with Ben to get the rings. While they were there, she went into labor. Ben had to perform a crash C-section on her with no anesthetic. She and the baby were then brought to Grey Sloan Memorial so she could have surgery.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nFollowing the surgery, April recovered in a room. Catherine came to Seattle to meet her granddaughter and she was told by April that she and Jackson had named the baby Harriet, after Harriet Tubman. Catherine assumed the baby's last name was to be Avery, but April told her they were hyphenating since the name Kepner means good things where she comes from.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref> Harriet was soon cleared to go home, but April needed to stay in the hospital for wound therapy. Before taking his daughter home, Jackson stopped by her room. April started crying as she feared she would be missing out on bonding moments, so she told Jackson to leave with Harriet so she could stop crying. Jackson then called her from home to check on her. They talked for a moment about how April would take care of Harriet once she could leave the hospital. Jackson suggested a baby nurse, but April made it clear she couldn't afford that and that she did not want his help since they were separated. Later that night, Jackson FaceTimed April because Harriet wouldn't go back to sleep, so April sang to her to lull her back to sleep. When he visited the next day, Jackson suggested to move in with him so they could take care of their daughter together until she was fully healed. She initially refused because she needed boundaries, but promised him she'd think about it.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\nHer incision healed well and she was allowed to go home. She got bored at home and visited the hospital to get some movement. She dropped Harriet with Jackson and went to check on the ER. Later, she fed Harriet and bonded with Alex over being out of the game for a while. At the end of the day, she admitted she was bored, so Jackson took their daughter so she could treat a patient in the ER.<ref>[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]], x</ref>\n\nApril started to annoy him by being determined to be a perfect guest, but after a talk with Jackson, she came to realize she was his roommate and didn't have to feel like a guest.\n\n\nCatherine manipulated the situation when Jackson and Meredith were supposed to treat a girl with laryngeal cancer in Montana. She knew Jackson took the case because the hospital was close to where his father lived, so she had Meredith switch with April, figuring she'd offer a better support system. April and a grumpy Jackson continuously butted heads until she found out the real reason behind the trip and confronted him about it. They continued to work together to find a solution and eventually when they did, they ended up having sex given their track record in hotels. \n\nAfter returning to Seattle, April let the situation linger for weeks and focused on work. When an explosion occurred, April found out through Maggie that Jackson stayed in the building to look for Stephanie. He later exited the hospital carrying a patient. Both Maggie and April yelled at him for his heroic behavior that worried them. April noticed the way Maggie handled his oxygen mask and the way she and Jackson looked at each other. After things had calmed down, Maggie came to apologize as she felt her scolding Jackson was out of line, since April was the one who should be yelling at him given their shared daughter. April then told Maggie that she could tell that Jackson liked her, and she felt like Maggie liked him, too. She advised Maggie to tell him how she felt, and headed out for incoming patient.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, April and Arizona had lunch where they talked about Eliza ghosting Arizona. April pointed out Eliza at least made her intentions clear, unlike Jackson after their Montana escapade.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref> Jackson found out what April had told Maggie and wanted to address this, but April dodged the question. Nathan's lingering love triangle with Megan and Meredith made her realize that she needed clarification from Jackson. That night at home, Jackson again asked to talk about Maggie, but April instead admitted that she had actually been wanting to talk about what had happened in Montana. Unlike him, she wasn't good at compartmentalizing, so the situation caused her pain. She told him that she had spent weeks wondering what it meant and if it was just casual sex, that was something she wasn't comfortable with. She then decided it was time for her to move out, since their situation was causing her pain.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref> Her moving out also meant that she had to adjust to nights without Harriet. She hung around the hospital as she had trouble going home without her daughter. Arizona recognized that from own life and assured her that it becomes a new normal.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nApril continued to use Tinder as she wanted to date someone from outside the hospital. April later attended the intern mixer to mingle with the newest group of interns. She witnessed Richard announcing Meredith's nomination for the Harper Avery Award.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref> On the day of the Harper Avery ceremony, April and Meredith operated together while Meredith actually had to leave for the ceremony. April thought she was taking her talent for granted while she had to work hard just to be average. Meredith assured her she wanted the Award badly and was sticking around because their patient reminded her of Cristina. She assured April she was not average.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\n\nApril was in charge of running the ER when the hospital computer system was hacked, rendering the monitors, bloodbank, and drugs unavailable. April learned new tricks from Richard, who was the only doctor with experience from before medicine was influenced by technology.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> After successfully running the ER until the crisis was resolved, Richard approached April and said he felt too old to run the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. April, unaware that he wanted to hand over the reigns in order to be able to participate himself, happily jumped at the chance to take over being the judge.\n\nThe next morning, April worked on [[Paul Stadler]] after a hit-a-run.<ref>[[---]], x</ref> Meredith urged her not to lose him. When briefing Owen, he questioned why she wasn't participating in the contest. She then realized Richard had played her and went to give the contest back to him, but he refused. Soon after, [[Karin Taylor]] ended up in the ER in labor. As April was delivering the baby, she was shocked to see that Karin's husband was [[Matthew Taylor]], her ex-fianc\ue. The baby was taken to the NICU. When April went to check on Karin, she told April that she had heard a lot about her and made it clear she did not want to hear April's side of the story. April had to treat another patient, [[David Roman]], who attempted to cut off his hand to keep himself from masturbating per the Bible's instructions. April helped him to understand metaphors. Meanwhile, April noticed the impact [[Eric Sterling|Eric Sterling's]] case had on her colleagues, as the boy was shot by the police while trying to enter his own house through the window.\n\nShe was paged back to Karin Taylor's bed since Karin was experiencing pain. Both admitting to an awkward situation, April examined and found a vulvar hematoma, which she drained. Afterwards, April joined her colleagues as they were waiting for Eric's scans. Upon returning to the ER, Matthew was arguing with [[Taryn Helm]] over Karin not being sent to a private room yet. April instructed Taryn to make that happen. She then had a talk with Matthew, who figured she was still with Jackson and a -year-old. April chose not to fill him in on the painful loss of Samuel and talked about Harriet instead. Later, Karin ended up in extreme pain, but April had to hand her over to Arizona as her help was necessary for Eric. However, her colleagues had it covered as soon as they arrived in the OR and sent her away. She was then shocked to see on the board that Arizona was operating on Karin. She went to check and was told that Karin had DIC and HELLP syndrome. Arizona had already removed her uterus and wondered why April hadn't called her sooner.\n\nGuilt-ridden, April went to the chapel, where she ran into Matthew. He ignored her and left. She then broke down in the chapel. After leaving, she came to find that Eric had died. She heard Jackson's speech about police bias and when asked for a statement by an officer, she said that she couldn't have faith in a system where an officer shot and killed a boy trying to enter his own house. Richard then paged her to David's room. While he had made a full recovery, he had come to question the meaning of the Bible and faith. He asked her for guidance, but, thoroughly shaken by the events of that day, she was unable to provide an answer. She was further shaken to find out that Paul Stadler had died while he only had a concussion, but the real shock came when she went to the ICU to check on Karin, only to arrive to see her being zipped into a body bag. Distraught and having lost God in the face of all the unfairness and inequity and cruelty she had been confronted with that day, she ended up watching a grieving Matthew with his daughter in the ICU, after which she went to the bar to drink. She was approached by [[Vikram Roy]] and ended up sleeping with him at her place. The next morning, he joined her in the shower.<ref name=\":\">[[Personal Jesus]], x</ref>\n\nShe continued to sleep with Vik as her downward spiral continued. She arrived to work late and hungover to post the rules to the contest, which the doctors were eagerly waiting for. They had three days to turn in an essay on their proposed projects. While running from Vik, who didn't seem to understand her no-daylight rule, she found Arizona delving into the US's maternal mortality statistics after the loss of Karin Taylor. After three days, April and the team of esteemed surgeons she had assembled read through all the proposals and chose  of them to receive seed money.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nApril continued to come to work hungover from the night before, even going as far as using banana bags to help her sober up. As she came to greet Harriet in daycare before starting her day, Jackson expressed some concern over her, but she brushed it off. April had earned herself the nickname The Party among the interns while Vik openly bragged about his sexual experiences with her, which further worried Jackson. At the end of the day, he confronted her, but she told him he wasn't her that and left as she had plans. While Arizona had brushed off Jackson's concerns at first, she came to see they were valid when she entered the bar and witnessed April standing on a table and pouring shots for the interns as they chanted.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nHer downward spiral also resulted in a no-nonsense attitude. When a group of rugby players ended up in the ER, they tossed around their ball and hit April as she was draining an outer ear bleed, resulting her accidentally cutting the ear off. Later, one of the rugby players requested another doctor based on the accident. April punished him for that by assigning him an intern. Owen then took her aside and told her to go home for the day, as Bailey had found out about the incident before April had reported it and requested an investigation. She lashed out as she thought it was unfair she was getting punished for someone else not following the rules. That night, April attended Maggie's game night with her own booze. She teamed up with [[Tom Koracick]]. All throughout the night, she made sure everybody follow the rules to the letter and speeched about their importance in making sure life wasn't meaningless. After Maggie's boyfriend's wife showed up, the night ended abruptly. An inebriated April seductively asked Tom for a ride, to which he eagerly agreed.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nHe stayed overnight. She wanted him to leave so she could vomit in private, but he stayed to look for breakfast. As she was mixing herself a Bloody Mary, he looked around her home and concluded that the warm-hearted woman who lived there and acted as Amelia's healthy proxy was currently nowhere to be found. He wondered how she became the April he had met the night before. He started guessing and eventually hit the crisis of faith. April then finally admitted out loud that she hated God so much that she wished He were dead. They stayed at her place all day for more sex. Over takeout, April expressed her anger at people who blatantly disregard His teachings and receive absolutely no punishment, while people who spend their lives trying to emulate and honor Him are brutally mistreated, like she felt she had been. Tom opened up about his own crisis of faith after losing his son and inquired about the reason behind her crisis of faith, but she avoided the question by initiating more sex. Due to their talks, she forgot she was supposed to have Harriet that night and was surprised when Jackson showed up to drop her off. He noticed her state of mind and offered to keep Harriet, but she took her daughter and closed the door on him right after he saw Tom in April's robe.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day at work, April insisted Owen let her join on trauma certification day for the interns. She severely worsened the fictional situation that injured the dummies and instructed the interns that there were no rules in this harsh, uncaring world. One by one, she declared the dummies dead with surprise twists and had Andrew pretend he was hurt by a piece of shrapnell from yet another plane. April then went on to use a hose to simulate rain to mimic her own trauma cert day until she was paged to the ICU. When she returned from a wild goose chase, Taryn told her that Casey had set that up to get her away. He defended himself and stated she was the biggest threat to their patients. She started laughing because he cheated the system like she had done herself, which resulted in the death of a car crash victim she was unable to save. Andrew offered a time-out, but April broke down and said God doesn't just stop handing out traumas. She then completely spun out of control and frantically started performing CPR on a dummy she had made up a life story for. Eventually, she came back to her senses and wandered inside.\n\nShe ran into Jackson, who took her into a supply closet and demanded to know what had been going on with her. He wondered when she decided they weren't friends anymore. He assured her he was there for her. She then hugged him and kissed him. He immediately broke it off and told her to face whatever was wrong with her. She then told him to take Harriet that night if he really wanted to help. Later, while putting the dummies back in storage, she broke down and cried by herself in the dark.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nShe continued to drink, at one time even falling asleep at the bar. She was woken up the bartender and went to work. She started treating rabbi [[Eli Rigler]], who came in for a rash. April examined him and diagnosed toxic epidermal necrolysis, a side effect from the antibiotics Bailey had prescribed him for the third time for diverticulitis. Eli was transported to the burn unit, where Jackson and April made him comfortable. While he didn't want to worry his wife, they told him his condition was worse enough to call her. Privately, April lashed out at Bailey for prescribing the antibiotics instead of performing surgery. Jackson defended Bailey, but April firmly said they all knew that Eli was dying and that his death was on Bailey.\n\nLater, April went to check on him and told him his wife was on her way. He refused to be given more medication before his wife's arrival. He saw a worried Bailey hovering outside and told April it was okay for her to come in, though April refused that. He noticed April disliked her for her decision while he himself didn't blame her. He figured out that April was in pain and offered to help to take it away, which he considered his job. For the first time in a long time, she opened up and shared that she was doubting her faith because of all the bad things that happened to her. She said she was taking care of herself for once rather than following His rules, because apparently that didn't make good things happen to her. He told her there are no guarantees for a life free of suffering or injustice in faith. He stated faith wouldn't be real faith if people only believe when things are good. Horrible things happen and nobody knows why. People can either believe in God or believe that to be pointless, whichever makes them happier. He asked her if she was happy, which made her cry. He saw her unimaginable pain, a feeling he knew well. He believed God wasn't indifferent to their pain. He said the world was full of brokenness and that it was their job to put it back together. She then asked to let her take some of his pain away, but he stated she already did by opening up to him about her pain. He told April to tell Bailey that he forgave her. She tried to get him to hang on to see his wife, but he believed her to be his wife as he started dying. She rolled with it and comforted him until he passed.\n\nAfter his death, April went to the chapel and found a guilt-ridden Bailey there, trying to light a candle. April assisted her and told her that some things just happen and people don't get to know why, like Eli had told her.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, April came to work with her faith restored. She started the day out in the chapel to gather strength. She then spent the entire day apologizing to people that she had treated badly during her crisis of faith. They all forgave her. While she had avoided Jackson throughout the day, she approached him at daycare to ask if she could have Harriet. She assured him she was good and finally told him that she lost God after losing her patients for no reason. That had never happened to her before and it scared and angered her. She explained that all throughout their marriage, she wanted Jackson to know God like she did, but he never. And then she lost God and it made her feel like Jackson somehow had won, which she hated and made her hate him. She realized that Jackson was there for her while God wasn't and she thanked him for that. April ran into Maggie on the way out and apologized to her, especially for game night. Maggie still hated that she slept with a married man. April then related her own poor choices to her, saying she slept with the douchey intern and Tom Koracick and also jumped her ex-husband in the closet.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Matthew came to the hospital with his daughter, April hovered outside the room while Arizona examined the girl. Matthew requested another doctor and Arizona suggested Owen. April then took over in the ER so he was free to do so. April continued to hover and told Owen that she had a feeling it was a gastrointestinal problem, which turned out to be correct. Owen gave her credit when he told Matthew the diagnosis. April later ran into Matthew in the chapel. He scooted over and allowed her to sit with him.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nOn [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest|Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest Prototypes Day]], April ate some cookies that contained peanut-butter cannabis and became high as a result. With the judge and several contestants high, the Prototypes Day was postponed. All the high doctors were placed in a room together, though all wandered around. April overheard the conversation where Catherine and Jackson talked about Harper Avery being a sexual predator. She told Bailey and also shared that she was secretly seeing someone. Together, they held a funeral for Harper and his reputation, which led to Meredith finding out.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the scandal about Harper Avery broke to the press, Maggie found out that Jackson had funded the Contest himself. April was shocked upon finding out and went to yell at Richard for setting her up to look like she was in cahoots with her ex-husband. Later that day, she overheard Jo and Alex failing at wedding planning and offered to do it for them, which they happily accepted. Maggie later came to apologize to April, who assured Maggie that Jackson had a reasonable explanation for what he did.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nJackson tried to deal with the scandal by paying the personal settlements with his money, since the new Catherine Fox Foundation had to use all of its money to keep the Avery hospitals afloat. Jackson paged April and told her that he had set aside a substantial amount of money for their daughter, so she would never have to worry. April deeply appreciated it and thanked him. She told him he was on the right path.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nAfter sending out the wedding invitations to Alex and Jo's wedding, April was picked up by Matthew for their volunteer work at a clinic. April warned Matthew for a curve, but they ended up in a car accident. Disoriented, April got out of the car and called , but she fell into a ravine by the road and ended up in partially submerged in a cold river. The first responders didn't know she was there and took Matthew to the hospital. Matthew uttered April's name and since they couldn't reach her, the doctors started to worry about April. Owen had the paramedics take him to the scene of the accident and found her several hours after the accident. She was ice cold and had no vitals. Refusing to declare her dead until she was warm and dead, the attendings and interns worked together to perform CPR and warm her up. Maggie put April on cardiopulmonary bypass in the OR while they continued to warm her up. Jackson found out three hours after the doctors started treatment. They all stood around and prayed for a heartbeat. Maggie noticed what she thought to be V-fib and defibrillated time and time again, which eventually resulted in a rhythm. They all cheered and April was moved to the ICU. She didn't wake up and they all started to fear for brain damage. All of April's friends gathered around her bed.\n\nArizona was one of the last people to find out and told the others that April and Matthew were seeing each other again. They had both been through so much since they separated and understood each other's pain, which made them fall in love again. They decided to keep it a secret because they didn't want judgment or opinions on Matthew not waiting long enough after his wife's death. They all continued to pray for April, but Amelia eventually deemed it time to call her family as April still hadn't woken up.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Jackson prays to God to bring April back.]]\nThe doctors left Jackson alone with April. He believed she was still there and even started praying to God to bring April back. She woke up moments later. All her loved ones were happy to have her back. She remembered calling  and falling and being unable to get up, and then she felt warmer and safer, and eventually woke up to a praying Jackson. She was convinced she didn't really die as she hadn't met Jesus, which she was sure she would if she actually died. They then all left to let her rest. Owen was the last to leave and April expressed her gratitude by saying he always comes to bring her back. Maggie later came to check on her and said Jackson was willing to bring Harriet by any time she wanted. April decided to wait till the next day as to not scare her. Bailey then brought Matthew by for a visit. Their beds were placed in the same room for the night and they slept holding hands.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the accident, April quit her job to do God's work, which meant devoting herself entirely to the clinic providing healthcare access for Seattle's unhoused community. She and Matthew continued to spend time together with their daughters.\n\nWeeks later, the time finally arrived for Jo and Alex's wedding. While she had perfectly organized everything to the last detail, she made a mistake on the GPS link, causing the majority of guests to be late. When they finally arrived, everyone complimented April's work on the location and Catherine invited April to Sunday dinner. April then went to check if Jo and Alex were ready, only to discover that they had disappeared. April encouraged everyone to set out to find them. She sat down with Arizona and convinced her that falling in love with Callie again after all the hurt she caused wasn't a catastrophe, giving her rekindled love with Matthew as an example that people change and that life changes them. The real wedding catastrophe arrived when [[Kirsten]] went into anaphylactic shock. The doctors worked together to crike her and had her taken to a local hospital. The entire experience and the fact that the minister still hadn't showed up ruined the wedding. While the rest of the guests and Jo and Alex took the ferry back to the city, a disappointed April stayed behind with Matthew, Arizona, Jackson, and Sofia to clean up the mess.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Matthew proposes to April.|xpx]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|April and Matthew get married.|xpx]]\nMatthew seized the opportunity to say that he wanted to give them a second chance at marriage. He loved who she was five years ago and he loved who she was today even more. He also loved how she trusted God and how she talked to Ruby and prayed with Harriet. He told her she saved him and his daughter. He knew it was crazy, but he didn't want to waste any more time. He proposed to her and she happily accepted. At that very moment, the minister finally arrived at the right location and the newly engaged couple decided to get married right then and there. April asked Jackson to stay because of how special he was in her life. Arizona compiled a bridal bouquet and Sofia served as the flower girl. Arizona walked April down the aisle. April and Matthew were then married by the minister in an intimate and Christian ceremony, marking the start of their new life together.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Jackson wants to move to Boston and Needs April to come]]\nYears later, Jackson approached April about moving to Boston because he wanted to run the Catherine Fox Foundation but didn't want to leave their daughter. He said that if April didn't agree, he wouldn't go even though he felt like it was his calling. After a night of talking and fighting about it, the next morning, April, though hesitant at first, ultimately agreed to move to Boston with Jackson and their daughter. Jackson, while happy and excited about April agreeing to move, thought it wouldn't be so simple and that she would have had to talk to Matthew first, to which April revealed that her and Matthew had split, explaining how at first, the two thought that it was God's plan to bring them back together after all their pain, but Matthew still resented her for leaving him at the altar. When Matthew's sister got sick, he and his daughter, Ruby, went to Philadelphia to care for her and never returned. She also explained how it was her way of dealing with her guilt of leaving Matthew at the altar. All in all, she explained that it was essentially a trauma marriage. She explained that she didn't want to tell Jackson they split up because there were so many casualties in the world and she didn't think her marriage counted as one. Jackson also teased her, saying she had too much pride and she jokingly agreed.<ref>[[Look Up Child]], x</ref>\n\nWhile in Boston, she and Jackson grew closer to one another again and rekindled their relationship.<ref>[[You Are the Blood]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen April first arrived at the hospital, she was extremely insecure and wrote notes to herself in a personal diary to help cope with her insecurities. She wrote notes telling herself nobody could tell she has had plastic surgery on [[File:x-.png|thumb|left|April cheering on her fellow teammates.]]her nose, and that she could one day be the future of medicine. Although April seems to be a little bit fragile, the shooting at the hospital proved that she is much stronger than she seems.\n\nSince making some new friends at the hospital, April seems to have become much more confident in herself and her abilities, and little by little showed more of her personality. It's been noted by [[Owen Hunt]] that although April panics under pressure, she shows promise as a trauma surgeon due to her tenaciousness. Along with being extremely organized, April is also very competitive - refusing to give up until she wins. April's most noticeable quality is her ability to read people. She's extremely receptive and notices things that most people would overlook. Also, unlike most of her peers, April is a morning person. She is also compassionate and understanding. April also cares deeply about her friends and patients. Along with those qualities, she also has some flaws - such as her inability to filter what she says and the extreme anxiety that causes her to come off as annoying. April also has a tendency to push people away and shut them out when she is hurt. April can also become very emotional over little things.  \n\nAfter losing her child, she seems to be much stronger and more serious about everything.\n\n\n\nJoseph\nShe went to the homecoming dance with a boy named Joseph.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nShe had a big crush on the married [[Derek Shepherd]] following the merger. Jackson said of the crush, \"she thinks he walks on water\" to Meredith.\n\n[[Robert Stark]]\nDuring a time in pediatrics, [[Robert Stark]] flirted with her. April didn't want to pursue a relationship with him and declined an invitation to Robert's apartment for dinner. They remained friendly after that.\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Jackson protecting April.]]\nAfter the shooting at the hospital, Jackson and April became close when she noticed he'd been having nightmares about the tragedy. He then grew very protective of her - claiming she was the only friend he had left.\nApril has always been very close to God, and she says she remained a virgin so long due to her religion - which Jackson respected. However, she decided to sleep with him the night before their [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical boards]], giving up her virginity and putting somewhat of a strain on their friendship.\n\nWhen April returned to Seattle Grace Mercy West, she informed Jackson she was \"revirginizing\". He didn't support this action because he felt she was trying to pretend they never happened, but he promised to help her in any way that he could. However, in the end, no matter how hard they tried to stay away, they couldn't resist each other.\n\nAt the point of their relationship in which Jackson established that he had feelings for April and he was hurt that she referred to their relationship as a ''dessert'' or a ''car crash'', April noticed that her period was  days late. Because she'd never been so late before, she thought she was pregnant. While waiting for the results of the pregnancy test, Jackson told her that he was all in and that they would have a wonderful wedding with butterflies and that they would raise the kid together. However, the test came back negative, to which April responded with relief and delight. She said to Jackson that they dodged a big bullet and that they wouldn't have to get married anymore. This hurt Jackson's feelings and he broke up with her - stating that perhaps this was a sign they shouldn't be together.\n\nSoon after, Jackson began seeing intern Stephanie, which first started out as only a sexual relationship. Jackson told April himself, thinking it would hurt her even more if she heard from anyone else. April was glad that he did and thanked him, but confessed she still had some feelings for him and wasn't ready yet to be friends again. However, she soon met Matthew and they both concentrated on their own relationships. Jackson and April did become friends again, however, when April asked Jackson for advice on whether or not she should tell Matthew the truth about her virginity.\n\nDuring a massive storm near the hospital, a bus flipped and the doctors had to rush in and evacuate as many people as possible. The doctors believed they got to everyone, but Jackson stayed behind because he noticed a small pink shoe. When April noticed Jackson wasn't with them, she began to panic and rushed back towards the bus as it lay there ablaze, but was stopped by [[Matthew Taylor|Matthew]]. Suddenly, the bus exploded. Thinking Jackson was in the explosion, April became hysterical. When he emerged from the fire with a small child, she ran to hug him but was stopped by Matthew - who was trying to comfort her.\n\nWhen Jackson was being treated by Callie for his injuries, April walked in furious, screaming at him for almost dying, but was quickly removed by Callie and Matthew. Thinking she had lost Jackson made her realize her true feelings for him. When everyone calmed down, she went back in to see him. She told him that she wanted him and not Matthew - which Jackson quickly rebuffed by telling her she was marrying Matthew soon. April then told Jackson to give her a reason not to. Jackson said her reaction had nothing to do with him and that she should leave him out of it; he stayed with Stephanie, she with Matthew.\n\nAlthough Jackson and April were seeing different people, they remained friends.\n\nOn the day of April's wedding, she ran into Jackson at the hospital while searching for [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] and [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]. Jackson had previously told April he wouldn't be attending her wedding, but she asked him one more time if he would be there. He asked if she really wanted him there and she said yes. During the ceremony, however, Jackson broke up with [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] and told April he loved her and that he always has loved her in front of the entire crowd. It was later revealed that April and Jackson got married.\n\nAfter working on [[Jill Kasliner]], Jackson and April fought about how they would raise their children. April walked out and ended up staying with Arizona and Callie for a few days. She came back to retrieve her iPod and told Jackson that they couldn't table the discussion about how they'll raise their children any longer because she's pregnant. During her second trimester, April and Jackson discovered that their unborn son had Osteogenesis Imperfecta. After a series of tests, they soon learned that their son, whom they decided to name Samuel, suffered from type , the most fatal type. Their son died shortly after his induced birth.\n\nShe later left to serve as a trauma surgeon in the Army, causing stress on her marriage with Jackson. When she returned from her first tour, she and Jackson seemed to be in a good place; however, when April revealed that she would be returning to Jordan, Jackson told her that he would not be there when she got back. When April returned from the Middle East, she was eager to rekindle and fix her relationship with Jackson. However, Jackson was deeply hurt as he felt that she abandoned him and he did not wish to get back together. April declared that she would fight for their relationship until her death. Jackson suggested that they get a divorce and he moved into Ben and Bailey's house to stay separated from April as she would not leave on her own. Jackson and April had a nice dinner in hopes of talking about their relationship, but unfortunately, she was paged and they never got to the real conversation. April and Jackson later slept together. Afterward, April was avoiding a conversation with Jackson while he was eager to talk to her. April told Jackson that she knew what he was going to say about the fact that they had sex. He exclaimed that she had no idea. While Meredith was in the hospital, April and Jackson had an argument because Jackson served her divorce papers.\n\nThey later signed the papers shortly after April found out that she was pregnant with Jackson's baby.<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref> April refused to tell Jackson about the pregnancy. However, Arizona and Alex were worried about her, so Arizona ended up telling Jackson, shocking April.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref> Jackson was furious with April for not telling him herself. He went to her, asking to be involved and suggesting that she was waiting until it was too late for an early abortion. She said it was her body and therefore her decision.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nYears later, Jackson approached April about moving to Boston because he wanted to run the Catherine Fox Foundation but didn't want to leave their daughter. Though hesitant at first, April ultimately agreed to move to Boston with Jackson and their daughter. Jackson, while ecstatic about April agreeing to move, thought it wouldn't be so simple and that she would have had to talk to Matthew first. April then informed Jackson that she and Matthew had split up.<ref>[[Look Up Child]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and April eventually rekindled their relationship in Boston.\n\n[[Matthew Taylor]]\nA new paramedic at the hospital, Matthew has recently caught the attention of April, as he awkwardly asked her on a date after confessing to watching her for some time but he assured her he was not a stalker.\n\nThey were later seen bonding in an ambulance when Matthew receives a call about a nearby trauma. April rides along with him and they come across a hit and run accident involving a ten-year-old boy. April saves his life by assembling her fellow doctors to operate although [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] was no longer a trauma center at the time. When the doctors were eventually caught operating on the boy, [[Meredith Grey]] protected April by claiming him as her patient and \"accidentally\" deleting incriminating evidence from the new system. [[Alex Karev]] and [[Jackson Avery]] also defended April during a meeting with [[Owen Hunt]] about the situation.\n\nWhen all is said and done and the young boy is stable, April runs into Matthew on her way home from the hospital. He tells her she is the bravest, strongest, and most beautiful woman he has ever met. He tells her whenever he's around her, he loses all thoughts. April, flattered and somewhat shocked, kisses Matthew - much to the dismay of a jealous Jackson as he passes by with Stephanie.\n\nWhen April turns to Jackson for advice before a date with Matthew, Jackson reveals to April that his relationship with Stephanie is purely sexual and they're not romantically involved with each other. April then confesses to Jackson that she is unsure how to explain to Matthew that she is no longer a virgin, but still wishes to wait until marriage before having sex again. Jackson jokingly responds by saying he's going to think she's mentally ill, but April takes him seriously and her feelings are hurt. He later apologizes, however, and tells April to be honest with Matthew, stating that once he gets to know her, he will want to follow her anywhere.\n\nWhen April found out Matthew was saving himself for marriage - like she intended to do before sleeping with Jackson, she told him she was saving herself for marriage, as well - leaving out the fact that she was no longer a virgin. When she finally confessed to Matthew that she had lied, he was hurt, but accepted her for who she was.\n\nApril and Matthew were engaged to be married. He proposed to her via flashmob and she said yes, smiling from ear to ear and crying tears of joy.\n\nThey had a few bumps before the wedding, but they made it through. At the wedding ceremony, Jackson stood up in front of everyone and told her he loved her and he always loved her. April didn't respond. Matthew looked angry. Then she decided to run away with Jackson, leaving Matthew at the altar.\n\nFive years later, after divorcing Jackson, April was reunited with Matthew after helping his wife Karin deliver their baby. After Karin's death, they started seeing each other again, having matured from their first relationship and were married in a private ceremony witnessed by Arizona, Jackson, and Arizona's daughter Sofia.\n\nLater, April revealed to Jackson that she and Matthew had separated. At first, the two thought that it was God's plan to bring them back together after all their pain, but Matthew still resented her for leaving him at the altar. When Matthew's sister got sick, he and his daughter, Ruby, went to Philadelphia to care for her and never returned.<ref>[[Look Up Child]], x</ref>\n\n[[Vikram Roy]]\nAfter April had a day with several cases that made her question God and her faith, she went to the bar, where Vik came to sit next to her. The two ended up leaving together. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\nThey continued to sleep together, but with no contact during daylight. Despite this, he fell asleep at her place more than once. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nRoy took advantage of their relationship to get better opportunities at work. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\n[[Tom Koracick]]\nTom had sex with April after they met at [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie's]] game night. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")''\n\n \nShe is the second of four daughters. Her sisters are named Libby, Kimmie, and Alice.\n\n\n[[Reed Adamson]]\nBefore the shooting at Seattle Grace Mercy West, April and [[Reed Adamson]] were best friends and roommates, as well. When Reed was tragically murdered during the shooting, April was the first to find her. Finding her best friend shot to death at the hands of [[Gary Clark]] sent April into shock, but she quickly recovered and reported what she found to [[Derek Shepherd]]. April often still mentions Reed, indicating that they were very close friends.\n\n[[Charles Percy]]\nIt's unknown just how close April and Charles really were, but they were seen on several occasions laughing and joking around. April often disapproved of his crude humor, but overall seemed to get along with him.\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nWhen Lexie and April first met, Lexie found April annoying because [[Derek Shepherd]] seemed to take shine to her. Her jealousy caused her to steal April's diary and then read it. While reading the journal, she noticed tear drops on [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|Lexie & April tweeting about a surgery.]]the pages - indicating that April was crying while the notes were being written. Feeling immediately guilty, Lexie returned the diary and apologized to April.\n\nThey had another run in when [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] opened up to April about her miscarriage and not Lexie. Lexie, again became jealous and tried tricking April into annoying Meredith with her idea of a chore wheel. However, Meredith approved of the idea - much to Lexie's dismay. Lexie then blew up at April infront of Meredith - who quickly ended the confrontation and explained to Lexie that the only reason April knew about the miscarriage is because she was there when it happened. Lexie then apologized to April for treating her the way she did and gave her Izzie's room as an apology.\n\nLexie and April no longer had any negative feelings towards each other, and even developed a friendship of sorts. April even went to Lexie first for advice when [[Robert Stark]] asked her on a date.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nApril and Meredith didn't really start talking until the shooting at the hospital, when April kept her company during Derek's emergency surgery. Meredith was annoyed at April for crying during his surgery because she felt April had no right to cry, but April explained to her the reason she was crying was because her best friend, Reed had been murdered earlier that day. Meredith then held April's hand for the duration of Derek's operation.\n\nAfter the shooting, Meredith invited April to move into her home because April had been previously sharing an apartment with her deceased best friend, Reed. Meredith defended April when her peers were joking about April's virginity, and even told April she was beginning to like her when she stuck up for herself and put everyone else in their place.\n\nSince Meredith and Derek adopted [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]], April has played babysitter for her on several different occasions. Meredith is also a bridesmaid at April's wedding.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nLike he is to everyone, Alex was very rude upon meeting April, but it didn't take her long to notice this was only a defense mechanism he used to prevent people from getting too close. He continued being rude to her for quite [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|Alex showing off his scrub designed onesie to April.]]some time, but she still treated him as a friend - doing his laundry and sharing her groceries with him.\n\nWhen Robert Stark stole Alex's idea during a surgery, April defended him to the chief and made sure Alex received credit for his idea. She later met up with him in an on-call room and made sure he knew he was appreciated, and that she noticed all the good he's been doing. This prompted Alex to kiss her, but being a virgin she asked him to slow down - which frustrated him to the point that he screamed at her. He felt guilty, but left the room without saying a word.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex & April.]]\n\nApril avoided Alex for some time after that, but they reconciled over a slice of pizza on the way home from the hospital one day. When April failed her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical boards]], Alex comforted her and reassured her that hospitals would still want her regardless of not being [[Board Certification|board certified]].\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nIn April's office, she has a photo of [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] from their wedding day. She also made a onesie for baby [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] during Callie's baby shower that had a pie drawn on it accompanied by the words \"Cutie Pie\" decoratively written above. She was also seen dancing with both Callie and Arizona at their wedding reception. After April had a fight with Jackson, she came to Callie's and Arizona's house for a while.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nAfter Arizona was outed by Callie as being a cheater, April found herself relating to her in a weird way. Although April had never cheated, she did almost end things with Matthew to be with Jackson. After April overheard Callie tell everyone at the fundraiser that Arizona died in the plane crash, April took two bottles of champagne and met Arizona in the hospital storage closet to share a drink and comfort her. They soon became very open with each other and discussed their relationship problems together, bonding them. Arizona was also a bridesmaid at April's wedding. After a fight with Jackson, April came to Arizona's and Callie's house and stayed there for a few days. Arizona also comforted April after Jackson told her he wasn't going to be there if April left again.\n\nArizona was the first person to find out that April was pregnant again. She offered April drinks after she divorced Jackson. April refused and Arizona jokingly asked her if she was pregnant, to which April turned to her and replied \"According to the test I took this morning, yeah actually. I think I am.\"<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref>\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nLike many of the other doctors, Cristina found April to be somewhat annoying upon meeting her. Although April sometimes disapproved of Cristina's rule-breaking, she considered her a friend. When April was let go by the hospital for making a mistake in the ER, Cristina defended her to the other residents, claiming that everyone made mistakes that night and April was only fired because she was caught. During the race for chief resident, April and Cristina were assigned a case together and April often spoke out to Cristina about her habit of bending the rules, much to Cristina's annoyance. She was so annoyed by April's \"goody-two-shoes\" behavior that she exploded at her saying that no matter how hard she tried or how many charts she made, she would never be chief resident, but they later made up. After April failed her boards, Cristina showed kindness to her by comforting her after all of the hospitals turned her down. She even answered April's phone (pretending to be her) and told the hospitals that they were missing out because April was \"an amazing little surgeon.\" Cristina was a bridesmaid at April's wedding. After the wedding failed because April ran off with Jackson, Cristina said, \"I was on the fence about Kepner, but now I'm not only a friend, I'm a fan.\"\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\n[[File:xAprilKepner.png|thumb|left|Owen offering April her job back.]]\nAfter the shooting at the hospital, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] met with [[Richard Webber]] - the current chief of surgery to discuss a trauma training program he thought would benefit the hospital in case another emergency situation like the shooting arose. During this training, Owen was extremely impressed by April Kepner's determination and tenacity while caring for her \"dummy\" patients. He was even more so impressed when April refused to allow her patient to die, and accept the message Owen was trying to get across to the doctors - that trauma was unfair, and sometimes no matter what you do, your patients die. After the trauma training was over and all the doctors were certified, Owen mentioned to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] how proud he was, and although she didn't look like one, there was a trauma surgeon in that girl.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen comforting April.]]\n\nSince the training exercise, Owen has taken April under his wing and even comforted her before her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]] - telling her that \"she was a soldier.\" When she failed and was let go from the hospital, he flew out to Moline - her hometown and hired her back saying he should never have taken her job away from her.\n\nOn April's wedding day, Owen went through the entire hospital making sure everyone knew they had to be at the ceremony. Moments before April walked down the aisle, Owen told her she was beautiful, well-loved by the hospital, and kissed her cheek.\n\nOwen and April's friendship grew stronger during her second pregnancy when Owen consoled her as she was breaking apart from stress and fear that the pregnancy would end in another disaster. Later, she became his best man at his wedding to Amelia Shepherd, though she managed to lose the rings for a while and ended up missing the ceremony because her water broke while she and Ben were looking for the rings at Meredith's.\n\n\n\n\nApril was always top of her class in medical school and has received numerous heartfelt recommendations from her professors. During a meeting with [[Richard Webber]], he stated he has no doubt she is an excellent surgeon because she has the recommendations to prove it.\n\nApril spent most of her residency at [[Mercy West Medical Center]] but later moved to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] during the merger. When April arrived at Seattle Grace, Derek took a shine to her because she was full of intelligent and creative ideas. When [[Richard Webber]] was forced to let her go for making a mistake in the ER, Derek later rehired her because he felt she was unfairly fired and deserved a second chance. After being rehired, April decided to stick to more administrative work because she believed she wasn't a good surgeon anymore. She felt constantly guilty for losing her patient and couldn't handle any more losses. With a little encouragement from Derek, however, she finally began doing surgeries again and went on to become an excellent surgeon.\n\nApril Kepner was later chosen as Chief Resident of [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] when she impressed [[Owen Hunt]] with her patient checklist. She had a rough start, but later got a handle on things and became an excellent chief resident.\n\nHowever, nervousness got the best of her during her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]] causing her to fail. Although April was not a [[Board Certification|board-certified surgeon]] like her fellow doctors, she remained at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] as an [[Attending|attending]] [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]], with the intent of retaking her medical boards the following year, confident that she would pass the second time.\n\nIt has been noted that although the new interns refer to her as \"the dud\", she is one of their favorite surgeons and is the most willing of all her fellow attendings to teach them. Also, unlike the other doctors in the hospital, April doesn't hold grudges against the interns for making mistakes.\n\nWhen the trauma center at the hospital closed, April worked night and day with [[Derek Shepherd]] to hatch a plan to keep it open. They succeeded in receiving donations from the other departments but were devastated to find out all of their hard work was wasted. They found out the trauma center wasn't closing due to budget issues, but instead because trauma centers aren't a good selling point.\n\nWith the trauma center back in place at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], April finally feels she has her career headed in the right direction and becomes even confident that she will \"kick ass\" during her medical board exams. She did ultimately pass and become a board-certified surgeon. When Meredith was suspended, April was asked to step in as Head of General Surgery.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\nAfter surviving her near-fatal accident, April resigned from Grey Sloan and devoted herself full-time to charity clinics to provide medical care for unhoused communities in Seattle.\n\n\n*April was the first of the residents to be seen wearing navy scrubs, during the [[Hospital Shooting|hospital shooting]].\n*Growing up, April had terrible acne and wore braces and glasses until college; landing her the cruel nickname of duckie (\"the ugly duckling\") given by her sisters.\n*April took years of physical therapy as a child to correct pigeon toes (a condition in which a person's feet face inwards instead of straight ahead).\n*April watches Oprah.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref>\n*April cries at weddings.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], \ud</ref>\n*She wears contacts.\n*As a child, April had a fish tank, two hamsters, a pet pony, a pet duck, and two dogs named Buster and Pickles. Pickles was a Schnauzer. She says the pet duck lived in their house.\n*April is a bit of a photographer. She is seen taking pictures at almost every social event she and her fellow doctors attend.\n*In order to be able to communicate with the children from Alex's African program, April learned a bit of Swahili.<ref>[[White Wedding]], x</ref>\n*April used to Facebook Jackson's mother, [[Catherine Fox]], but removed her as a friend at Jackson's request.\n*She used to have a red journal with motivational messages to get her through the day, such as, \"You are the future of medicine\".\n*April was a virgin until the age of twenty-nine.\n*April lost her virginity to her ex-husband who is her longtime best friend, [[Jackson Avery]], about two years before they got married. Until [[Vikram Roy|Vik]], he was the only person she had ever had sex with.\n*When she was little, she had a pony named Sparkle.<ref>[[Adrift and at Peace]], x</ref>\n*April has fasted (abstained from any food or drink for a period of time for religious observation).\n*April has a dimple on her right cheek.\n*She is the only doctor who has been seen driving an ambulance.\n*April has had plastic surgery on her nose. It is unknown whether this was reconstructive or cosmetic.\n*April dreamed of being married in a field full of beautiful flowers with butterflies that are released when she says \"I do\" and mints that have the phrase \"mint to be\" on them but ended being married in two private ceremonies.\n*When April becomes nervous or upset, her voice becomes noticeably higher than usual. She also often waves her hands when trying to make a point.\n*According to [[Jackson Avery]] & [[Cristina Yang]], April is an excellent cook.\n*April is very talented when it comes to numbers and statistics. She even claims to become overly excited when numbers and statistics are mentioned.\n*She's the first character of whom a pregnancy that led to birth lasts for more than one season. All other pregnant characters gave birth in the same season they got pregnant in. Cristina's pregnancies lasted for two seasons as well, but those never led to a birth.\n*April can sometimes become too emotionally involved with her patients. She will often cry when she loses a patient and will go above and beyond to make sure her patients are comfortable.\n*April once cooked a special porridge for one of the African orphans [[Alex Karev]] brought to the hospital, prompting [[Robert Stark]] to give her a glowing review for chief resident to [[Owen Hunt]].\n*During her residency, she was interested in neurosurgery.\n*According to a patient at the hospital, April looks identical to the fictional [http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys_Targaryen Dothraki Princess] from the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series.\n**This is a curious comparison since in \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" the Dothraki Princess, Daenerys Targaryen, is a teenager with violet eyes and white hair, traits which April does not possess. Neither does she look like [http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen Emilia Clarke] who plays Daenerys in the HBO adaptation \"Game of Thrones\"\n*April has been let go by the hospital on [[I Saw What I Saw|two]] [[Flight|different]] occasions but was hired back each time.\n*April loves the song \"Sexy and I Know It\" by LMFAO.<ref>[[Migration]], \ud</ref>\n*Although she was not a [[Board Certification|board-certified surgeon]], April was still hired as an [[Attending|attending]] [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]/[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n*According to Cristina Yang, April has ''virgin superpowers'' and she knows everything.\n*As of [[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], April is board certified after passing her exams.\n*She named a pig after [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]], which she nicknamed \"Jax\".\n*April prefers to do her own laundry as opposed to sending it out because she claims to have a perfectly good washer and dryer at home.

Their, their names are Karen and Joe. [''crying harder''] I have three sisters! Libby's the oldest. I, I'm next, and then there's K-Kimmie and Alice. I, I, I haven't done anything yet. I haven't...I've barely lived! I, I'm not finished yet. No one's loved me yet. Please. Please. I'm someone's child! I'm a person! I'm a person!<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' Stop! Okay just stop. I'm a virgin, yes. So what? It's not something I talk about, okay? We all have things we don't talk about. Alex, you've been afraid of the elevator for like a month, but I never said anything because it's none of my business. And Jackson, you wake up every night screaming because you have nightmares. And, Meredith, you don't talk about Cristina because you're afraid she's never gonna be the same Cristina again. And Lexie, for God's sake, Mark never thought you were a psycho. He loves you. That's why he stares at you. Because he can't keep his eyes off the woman he loves. Of course, he's never gonna say anything cause he doesn't feel like he can. Well, we all have stuff we don't talk about! I am a -year-old virgin. Mainly because I wanted my first time to be special and then I waited too long and partially because I'm pretty sure guys find me annoying. I'm a virgin! That doesn\ut make it drinks conversation! We all have stuff we don't talk about!<ref>[[Superfreak]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' Hey, here's a question. Whatever happened to good, old-fashioned romance? No stuffing of turkeys or disinfecting sofas. But you know, what about nice, normal dates, where people talk, share a meal, get to know each other? And then wind up together. Not because they're monkeys but because they have genuine feelings in a committed way. I mean what is so wrong with that, huh?<ref>[[The Face of Change]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' I guess I have to believe that everything happens for a reason. It's all part of some plan; you\ure supposed to learn something. You lose a patient because you forget to check their airway, you don't make that mistake again. You fail your boards 'cause you're too busy sleeping with your best friend, maybe you stop doing that. The hospital you call home shuts down just when you're starting to feel like you've got your life together...<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' There's a thing we say when someone dies. We say it to the patients' family. We say, 'I'm sorry for your loss.' It's a pat little phrase and an empty one. It doesn't begin to cover what's actually happening to them. It lets us empathize without forcing us to feel their devastation ourselves. It protects us from feeling that pain, that dark, sinking, relentless pain. The kind that can eat you alive. And every day, I thank God for that. We can't get too close. If we felt even little of the joy and the hopes that our patients are saying goodbye to, we'd never be able to function. So we say, 'We're sorry for your loss.' and we hope it offers something. Some little bit of support. Some bit of peace. Some bit of closure. Something good. Some little piece of beauty in the midst of someplace dark. An unexpected gift, just when it's needed most.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''April:''' In trauma, we're concerned with one overriding question. How did this happen? What was the mechanism of injury? How do we see past the mess and confusion of trauma to figure out what the damage actually is? Infinite possibilities put the patient on the table in front of you. Now you have to figure out, will they live? Will you be able to save them or are they a lost cause? Every part of a trauma tells a different piece of the story and until you look at each and every injury, you can't see what went wrong. We talk about the mechanism of injury, about where it all started, but the truth is, it's sort of a myth. We can't boil every injury down to one single blow. What hurts us is cumulative. It happens over time. We absorb blow after blow, shock after shock, painful hit after hit. But even then, even if we know exactly how we got here, it doesn't mean we can fix it. we can't heal every wound and that's okay. I have to believe it's okay. I have to believe that even if something seems like it cannot be fixed, it doesn't mean it's broken.<ref name=\":\" />\n\n----\n:'''April:''' In the course of one day, Job received four messages, each with separate news that his livestock, servants, and  children had all died. He continued to be a faithful servant. He still prays to God. He persevered. Job's faith was tested and he passed the test. And for his faith, God rewarded Job with twice what he had before. \ucEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\ud That's what Jesus said on the cross before he died. \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" Job asked the question, too. But he kept the faith. And what did he get for it? Replacement children. PTSD. Was it worth it to have been a faithful servant? Or would it have been better to just curse God's name from the beginning? Where was God throughout all of Job's suffering and pain? He was winning a bet with Satan. It makes you wonder where He is through all of the unfairness and inequity and cruelty in the world.

She just bought you a hospital.|'''Catherine Fox''' to '''[[Jackson Avery]]'''}}\n\n'''Catherine Fox''' (formerly '''Avery''') is an attending [[Urology|urologist]] at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] and a part-time [[Attending|staff surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Her husband is [[Richard Webber]] and her son is [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]]. She's also the founder and current board chairman of the Catherine Fox Foundation.\n\n\n\nCatherine Avery first came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] when she performed a penile transplant on [[Ryan]]. She presented the case at grand rounds and then set all the residents up in a lab to see who would win the chance to assist her in the OR. Jackson and Meredith were the last two standing and scrubbed in to assist, along with Mark. When Meredith had to step out in the middle of the operation, April, who was observing and who had helped retrieve the graft, was selected to step in. When April suctioned too aggressively, Mark and Jackson had to harvest a new vein to graft blood flow. The surgery was finished successfully and Ryan was pleased with the end result. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine returned to Seattle to help reconstruct the bladder of [[Irene]]. They'd used her own stem cells to grow a bladder that her body wouldn't reject. The surgery went well and Irene's urinary incontinence was resolved. She brought along her fellow, [[Mara Keaton]], with the hopes of getting more information about Jackson's personal life. Jackson figured out her plan and refused to tell Mara anything. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\n\nShe originally planned for Jackson to be her date to the benefit, but he backed out and convinced Mara also not to attend. She tried to get Richard to attend with her, but he also declined, feeling disloyal to his wife. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine was a proctor at the oral boards the same year her son was taking them. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")''\n\nJackson was rattled because he could hear her through the walls as he was trying to concentrate on his test, after finding out that she had slept with Richard the night before.\n\nCatherine later told Richard that she'd checked with some of her friends and found out that one of the Seattle Grace doctors didn't pass. She worried that Jackson had failed because he was traumatized by what he'd seen. ''(\"[[Let the Bad Times Roll]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine returned to the hospital again to treat [[Bryan Greenberg]], who had scrotal lymphedema. During that visit, April also avoided her because she knew Catherine would figure out she'd been having sex because she was obsessed with April's sex life. ''(\"[[I Saw Her Standing There]]\")''\n\n\nAfter a conversation with [[Richard Webber]] regarding their primary investor, [[Julian Crest]], falling through, Catherine Avery, along with the [[Harper Avery Foundation]], decided to contribute the necessary funds to purchase [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. As a caveat, however, Catherine wanted a representative of their choosing to sit on the board as chairman and selected her son, [[Jackson Avery]]. ''(\"[[This is Why We Fight]]\")''\n\nRichard believed that it was too much responsibility for Jackson to handle, but Catherine assured him that Jackson could handle it as he's an Avery. She gave him tips to help him and he ultimately stepped up to the challenge. ''(\"[[Transplant Wasteland]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard was electrocuted, Catherine came to the hospital and immediately criticized how his case was being handled. Catherine wanted to move him to another hospital, but he'd listed Meredith as his medical proxy, so she didn't have the authority. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n\nShe later believed his recovery was being hindered by the staff at the hospital, whom she said were coddling him because they love and fear him. She was impressed when she saw Richard demanding that his staff treat him as they would any other patient. ''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\n\nOn Richard's birthday, Catherine told him she'd be around, so he assumed they'd be doing something for his birthday, like a party. They later went to get dinner and she led him into his surprise party. ''(\"[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine presented the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]] the year Cristina was nominated. However, the award was given to someone else. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nShe later told Richard that Cristina had the votes, but had lost because of the Harper Avery Foundation's interest in the hospital. They didn't want it to look like she won simply because the Harper Avery Foundation owns the hospital. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she learned April was pregnant, Catherine came to visit Seattle to see her and Jackson. While she was there, there was an explosion at a mall. When she saw April worried about the state of the world and raising her child in it, she told April that the world changed by good people raising their babies right and told April she'd be okay. ''(\"[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\")''\n\nWhen April and Jackson learned that their baby had osteogenesis imperfecta and was in pain as his bones were already breaking, Catherine came to Seattle and told April to set aside a day, during which they'd induce labor and she'd have him baptized right in the hospital room, then she could hold him until he died. ''(\"[[All I Could Do Was Cry]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thomas Archibald]] came into the hospital after his wife cut his penis off upon finding out he was cheating with his sous-chef, Catherine, who was in town for a conference, was called in to re-attach it. The reattachment was successful, but shortly thereafter, his penis was cut off again. The second re-attachment was also successful. ''(\"[[Crazy Love]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] stepped down as [[Chief of Surgery]], the board needed to vote in a new Chief. ''(\"[[Time Stops]]\")'' Richard suggested [[Miranda Bailey]], but Catherine insisted that she go against an outside candidate of her own choosing. ''(\"[[You're My Home]]\")''\n\nShe brought in [[Tracy McConnell]], but [[Miranda Bailey]] ultimately won and was named the new Chief of Surgery. ''(\"[[Sledgehammer]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she found out April was pregnant again, Catherine came to Seattle. She spoke to April about her own experience with pregnancy and the seemingly peaceful conversation led April to extend an olive branch to Jackson. However, Catherine revealed to him that she had talked to April to get proof that April had committed fraud so they could go after her. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\nShe tried to get Jackson to make a case for getting sole custody once the baby was born, but instead, he tried approaching April peacefully, which worked. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Catherine planned a visit to Seattle, Richard planned a small get-together with a few friends. However, she surprised him by showing up a week early, saying she couldn't wait to see him. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\n\nAfter April gave birth to her daughter, Catherine came to visit them both. She was delighted to hear they'd named the baby Harriet but dismayed to learn the baby's last name wasn't Avery. When she questioned why they couldn't hyphenate, Jackson told her they had. The baby's last name was Kepner-Avery. ''(\"[[Undo]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine came to the hospital to meet with Bailey about Alex. She believed Bailey was being too lenient and wanted Bailey to replace Alex. At the end of the day, Bailey took a stand and said she wasn't going to fire Alex. Catherine said that was fine, but then said too many people had gotten second chances and she wondered why they needed them in the first place. She wanted to work on the surgical residency program to return it to its former glory. ''(\"[[Roar]]\")''\n\nAs a solution, she hired [[Eliza Minnick]]. ''(\"[[Why Try to Change Me Now]]\")''\n\nWhen Catherine came back to check on Bailey's progress, she was shocked to hear how resistant the attendings were to the change. She offered to let Bailey release her on them if she needed. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\nRichard learned that it had been her decision to hire Eliza to replace him, making him feel betrayed. ''(\"[[It Only Gets Much Worse]]\")''\n\n\nWhile working together at the hospital, Catherine butted heads with both Jackson and Richard over what she had done. They continued to fight as they treated a patient together. ''(\"[[Civil War]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine watched Harriet for a few days while April and Jackson went to Montana for a case. While Jackson was there, he met up with his estranged father and made peace with him not being around. When Jackson returned to Seattle, he thanked his mother for everything she'd done for him. ''(\"[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine attended the press conference about Meredith and Nathan's work on the plane. ''(\"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Catherine learned about the hospital fire and Stephanie being taken by a rapist, she called Bailey, Richard, and Eliza into a room and questioned how it happened and why it took so long to find Stephanie. Eliza told her about forgetting to tell the cops about Stephanie being missing because she was following protocol and evacuating patients. This upset Bailey, who fired Eliza on the spot, saying they had no room for someone who didn't know when to violate protocol. She didn't want a place that churned out surgical robots. She wanted their program to raise surgeons. Catherine started to object, but Bailey said she was the chief and she'd made her decision. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\n\nHarper and Catherine came to town to look over the expenditures at the hospital as part of the renovation after the fire. After reviewing the numbers, Harper wanted to pull out the [[Harper Avery Foundation]] funding. Bailey explained to him why he shouldn't do that and he agreed not to pull out, but then he fired Bailey instead. Catherine told Bailey she'd go to bat against Harper for her, but before she could, they found Harper dead in the conference room. ''(\"[[Go Big or Go Home]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Harper's funeral, which she said was full of people saying only positive things about Harper, Catherine and Richard had a family dinner with Jackson and Maggie, at which she revealed that Jackson was inheriting millions of dollars from his grandfather. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was nominated for a Harper Avery Award, Catherine invited her, Maggie, and Zola to join herself and Jackson on a private plane to Boston for the ceremony. Catherine was annoyed when Meredith instead stayed behind to treat a patient. At the ceremony, Catherine presented the award to Meredith and Jackson accepted it on her behalf and gave a speech about the loss she'd overcome. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Bailey was hospitalized for a heart attack, Catherine brought food and beverages to the hospital for Richard and Ben. ''(\"[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine came to the hospital with her friend, [[Michelle Velez]], so Michelle could pitch to them a project idea, using herself as a patient, for a new technique for vaginoplasties as part of gender-confirmation surgery. After the proposal, Catherine was upset because Jackson wanted to work on a different project instead. She had [[Dahlia Qadri]] write up a proposal for the vaginoplasty as well as Jackson's other idea. Jackson was convinced to choose to work on the vaginoplasty. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Michelle's surgery, Catherine and Jackson were fighting about him seeing Maggie, so Michelle started to back out. She refused to have the surgery until her surgeons were both on the same page and ready to focus on her because she only had one shot and wanted it to go well. Under her gaze, they worked out their disagreement. Catherine admitted that she didn't want it to affect her own relationship, which is why she was worried about it. Then they operated together and it went well. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard sat by [[Olive Warner|Olive's]] bedside while she died, Catherine took him food and drinks and sat with him for periods of time. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\nWhen an NDA signed after a lawsuit with Harper was preventing Amelia from getting access to research from [[Rebecca Froy]], Jackson had the legal team waive the NDA, after Catherine told him it was a minor spat over some research. However, she later told Richard that Jackson had ruined them. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\nCatherine immediately started to do damage control to protect the foundation as more allegations came to light. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\nAs word spread that Harper Avery had assaulted multiple women, Catherine hired [[Erin Mason]] to do crisis management. She suggested creating good PR by having Jackson do a charitable surgery and then having someone take the fall. Because she'd signed the settlements with the women, Catherine suggested herself, over Jackson and Richard's objections. With Erin's help, she drafted a statement taking the blame, but then Jackson and Meredith interrupted the meeting and showed her a statement they'd written in which they pledged to re-train and re-hire all the affected women under a new foundation, in Catherine's name. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Catherine was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. After the wedding planner ended up having an allergic reaction to shrimp and was sent to the hospital, the wedding party and guests then boarded a ferry, where Alex and Jo were married by Meredith. Catherine also ordered food to Jackson's place so the party could continue there. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nDuring her visits to Seattle, Catherine continued to spend time with Richard, which he enjoyed and said helped him sleep a lot better. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine had neck and back pain for weeks. When it became intolerable, she had some scans run, which showed a large spinal tumor. She called Koracick and Meredith to LA under the guise of a VIP patient. When they arrived, she showed them the scans and then told them she was the patient. They did a biopsy to look for cancer, which they found. The tumor was very aggressive, which worried Tom. Catherine talked about all the things she had survived and challenged Tom to help her survive this. ''(\"[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\")''\n\nWhen she found out that Meredith had told Maggie about the diagnosis, she fired Meredith from her team and advised her to keep away until the fury passed. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine had been working with [[Uma Paxton]], who had a recurrent vaginal tumor. She developed a surgical technique that would allow Uma to keep her uterus, preserving her fertility. However, when they operated, the tissue proved to be too friable, forcing them to perform a hysterectomy. Catherine was upset because she had told Uma she could do it and failed. After the surgery, she told Uma, who cried. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nThe day came for Catherine to have her surgery. Before her surgery, Jackson played \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" and they had a dance party in the OR. Then she was put under. Despite having to change the surgical plan to remove the tumor in pieces and open her from the front as well as the back, she woke up after surgery. When they told her they'd had to leave a small piece of the tumor behind, she said what was important was that she'd live. She'd need frequent scans to check on the tumor and would live with cancer probably for the rest of her life, but she'd be able to live that life. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\nAfter her surgery, Catherine had trouble accepting help. She hired a physical therapist, [[Marsha (Girlfriend in a Coma)|Marsha]], to give her some exercises she could do to get herself back to normal. However, she felt Marsha was condescending and resisted her help. After weeks of physical therapy, she finally felt able to do things by herself. On Valentine's Day, she and Richard were able to reconnect sexually. ''(\"[[Girlfriend in a Coma]]\")''\n\n\nTo celebrate her doctors and her survival, Catherine had Jackson throw a party, though she said she didn't want a large one. However, on the day of the party, she avoided going, saying she was hesitant to celebrate because she still has cancer and it's not over. Bailey convinced her to go to the party anyway and celebrate her life because she still has it. They went to the party, but before they could even finish toasting, a plastic pan accidentally placed in the oven forced a building evacuation. Catherine then decided to take Richard, Jackson, and Maggie to get some food, establishing a new tradition for after every scan she had to get, good or bad. ''(\"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine was brought in for the case of [[Caleb Hicks]], who had lost his penis and scrotum in an accident. The surgery was scheduled, but then it came out that Caleb didn't have the support system in a fianc\uee as he had claimed, as he'd actually broken up with her. Catherine canceled the surgery over his objections but later agreed to do it after he talked to Owen and reunited with his fianc\uee. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine came in unexpectedly to have a meeting with the insurance provider for the hospital employees after they believed they had a case of insurance fraud on their hands. After talking to the insurance company for over an hour, Bailey called Andrew into the room to ask him about [[Gabriella Rivera]] and her time at the hospital. He told them he had been the one to put down Ellis's name on the insurance forms and she accompanied him to the hyperbaric chamber so he could tell Meredith what he'd done and apologize. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nDue to the fraud that had taken place, Bailey and Catherine looked into Gabby's case themselves. When Gabby's cancer was found to be stage , they told her father it was highly treatable and survivable and Catherine pledged that the Foundation would cover all her treatment and associated costs, so he wouldn't have to worry about that. She also shared that she had cancer and was living with it.\n\nLater, Catherine and Bailey had a meeting with Meredith, who confessed what she had done. Alex and Richard then came in and confessed their parts in it, so Bailey fired all three of them. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\nAs a result of Bailey firing three of their best doctors, Catherine decided to hire [[Tom Koracick]] to oversee all the Catherine Fox Foundation doctors, including Grey Sloan Memorial. Bailey was irritated at having Tom be above her, but Catherine said it was what she felt she needed to do after what Bailey did with Meredith, Alex, and Richard. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine came back to Seattle and was working at Grey Sloan again. When she got a call that Richard's niece was at Pac-North, she went over there, where she saw Richard sitting with Gemma. Richard tried to explain to Catherine, but she said he was saying a lot for someone who didn't do anything wrong. Later, she talked to Gemma and said they were always looking for accountants for the Fox Foundation and had openings all over the country, though none in Seattle. She returned to wait with Richard and Chris until Maggie came out and informed them that Sabi had died. Catherine led Richard to help call the rest of the family. ''(\"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Catherine and Richard decided to separate, they invited Maggie and Jackson over for dinner to tell them. A wrench was thrown into their plans with Jackson invited Vic, who in turn brought Dean. An awkward dinner ensured. At the end of the dinner, they announced that they were separating. ''(\"[[The Last Supper]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine gathered with others at the hospital to watch the livestream of Richard's presentation of his PATH pen. She noticed something was wrong immediately when he mentioned fine-tuning his presentation with her help, which had not happened. They watched as he continued to present without making sense. They then watched as Maggie and Cormac led him off the stage and then the feed was cut. ''(\"[[Love of My Life]]\")''\n\nCatherine flew to Los Angeles and then she and Richard flew back to Seattle. Back at the hospital, she reassured him that he'd be okay and told the doctors, including Jackson, they needed to work harder to figure out what was wrong with him. ''(\"[[Sing It Again]]\")''\n\nAfter two weeks of testing and research, the doctors hadn't come up with a diagnosis other than Alzheimer's that fit his symptoms, so Catherine decided just to take him home. As they were leaving, Richard mentioned that his feet were tingling, which Meredith noted was inconsistent with the Alzheimer's diagnosis. She ran an EMG, which showed nerve degeneration, which meant his symptoms were physical as well as mental. They planned a nerve biopsy, but before they could do it, Andrew came into the OR and desterilized the instruments. He then told them Richard likely had cobalt poisoning from a hip replacement he'd had in Boston three years prior. He was immediately taken into surgery to have the old hip removed and replaced. Link found that the hip joint had broken down significantly, allowing the cobalt to leech into his body and cause all his symptoms. Link cleaned out the old hardware and replaced it. After his surgery, Richard was stable and back to normal. Catherine said she was having a bed brought in so she could spend the night, but Richard said he didn't want her to because of what she'd done, despite her having been by his side during his hospitalization. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n\nAbout a month into the pandemic, Catherine came to Seattle to have a budget meeting with Maggie. She considered the amount of money Maggie was asking for unreasonable, but the two of them vented together about the circumstances they were in and how it was all out of their control. She also met with Bailey about budget issues. Then she fired Koracick and hired Richard in his place, which helped lead to their reconciliation. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Andrew died, Catherine comforted Richard as he made plans for a memorial service, as they were unable to hold a funeral due to the pandemic. Later, when Richard confessed to struggling with everything, Catherine told him her latest scan had shown that none of her cancer had grown. She encouraged him to look for the good things. Later, Catherine attended Andrew's memorial service with Richard. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Irene Davis]] came to the hospital with a kidney stone, Catherine did a lithotripsy to break up the stone and remove it. When she tried to remove the scope afterward, Irene's ureter came with it, forcing them to convert to an exploratory laparotomy. The remaining ureter wasn't long enough to re-attach it to the kidney, so she had to remove Irene's kidney and then do autotransplantation to preserve her kidney function. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nAfter putting together a proposal for free COVID testing and treatment, Jackson and Alma sent that proposal on to Catherine for her consideration. Catherine told Jackson she'd resist the proposal when revenues improved, though he knew by then it would be too late. At the end of the day, he asked her why she never took him to protests or got involved on the ground floor. She tried to defend herself, but he was annoyed at all the barriers that were keeping people from getting the help they needed. She told him he sounded like his father, which he didn't think was necessarily a bad thing, a comment that upset her. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\nAfter a visit with his father, Jackson came to Catherine and told her he wanted to take over the Foundation and change its purpose to put money toward helping the most marginalized people. Catherine was initially shocked, but later told Richard she was proud of Jackson. ''(\"[[Look Up Child]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. When [[Bill Pierce]] and [[Antoinette Ndugu]] opposed the wedding, it was postponed until April . Catherine later attended the proper wedding. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard took back over as residency director, he decided to employ what he called The Webber Method. Catherine was reluctant, but eventually agreed. The idea was to allow the residents to operate on several patients who needed cholecystectomies, with the schedule staggered so the attending could rotate through and be available during the most complicated part to help. Despite one complication, the day went through successfully and thirteen patients were treated. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nWhen Levi made a mistake in surgery which resulted in the death of [[Devon Gomez]], an M&M was assembled to discuss how his death could have been prevented. Catherine came to the M&M to support Richard. At the same time, The Webber Method was suspended and was under review. After the M&M, Catherine told Bailey it was up to her if The Webber Method would continue or be permanently discontinued. Bailey decided it would be discontinued. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\nRichard called Levi every day, which he told Catherine he would continue to do until Levi called him back or returned to work. After making an error with [[Ivan|a patient]] one day, Richard came home and said that because of that error and the situation with Levi, he wanted all of his faculties tested and said he would stop operating if his skills didn't pass muster. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Nick Marsh]] came to Seattle to do a kidney xenotransplant, Catherine sent him a private jet and a stretch limo to bring him to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the surgical residency program at Grey Sloan Memorial was put on probation, Catherine came to Seattle and told Bailey she needed to make sure all the residents would say positive things about the program before she attempted to hire staff to cover the surgeon shortage. She was angered when Bailey instead told [[Jordan Wright (Character)|Jordan Wright]] to go back to [[Mayo Clinic]] because if the program were shut down, he wasn't guaranteed to get a replacement residency spot and she cared about his medical education. Catherine was further angered by Meredith's decision to leave Seattle to take a job of her own at Mayo Clinic and berated Meredith over it until Addison told her to stop. At the end of the day, Catherine was shocked when Bailey put on her coat and said she was taking a vacation. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\nCatherine stayed in Seattle had breakfast with Helen Anderson at the Medical Accreditation Council in the hopes she could help them saved the residency program. At the end of the day, she came to the hospital because Meredith had called her after Richard accidentally ingested a marijuana-infused drink Catherine had left in the fridge. Richard questioned why she would have that temptation in their house for him. She told him it was for her pain, as her cancer had progressed. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine began chemotherapy treatments at Grey Sloan Memorial as part of a trial Richard got her into. Richard sat with her during her treatments, reading about various clinical trials and looking for anything with promising results. While in treatment, she began speaking to [[Simon Clark|Simon]] and [[Kristen Clark]]. After he began to think Catherine might be continuing treatment only for him, he told her if was okay not to. She assured him she didn't want to stop treatment. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\nWhile undergoing these treatments, Catherine forced her loved ones to eulogize her in life, saying it wasn't fair to have to wait until she was dead to hear them say nice things about her. When she learned that her cancer was responding to treatment, meaning she was no longer dying from cancer but living with it, she and Richard decided to take a sabbatical so they could travel together. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\nMonths later, after their routine, Catherine had a scan, which showed her tumor was  millimeters bitter than her scan two months prior. Tom reminded her that at the last scan, it had grown and she promised to consider more treatment if it grew more. She and Tom reviewed some studies, but she decided not to seek more treatment and also refused to tell Jackson and Richard, despite Tom's pleading, saying she didn't want it weighing as a dark cloud over them. ''(\"[[When I Get to the Border]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Robert Avery]]\nCatherine was married to Robert Avery, who is the father of Jackson. It was revealed that he tried to take Jackson across the country away from Catherine, but she wouldn't put up with it and sued him for parental rights. He is currently estranged from Jackson. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nWhen Catherine returned to the hospital for a bladder transplant using a bladder they had grown from scratch, Catherine openly flirted with Richard. Initially, he flirted back with her because he considered it innocent. When Jackson ditched her as her date for a benefit, Catherine asked Richard to be her date and he agreed. However, that evening, he told her he was afraid he couldn't accompany her because his wife was in a home with Alzheimer's. Adele didn't recognize him anymore and he missed talking to her and laughing with her. He didn't feel like a man anymore with Adele, and Catherine's flirting made him feel like a man again. That made him not trust himself to go to dinner with Catherine. She told him he was a good man and they hugged, after which he left to go see Adele. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\nThey met again at the boards, where they both were examiners. They had dinner together and he confessed he hadn't seen Adele in a long time, as it only seemed to confuse her more. They continued their flirting and after she got the check, they ended up kissing in her hotel room. He hesitated before progressing, but a loving look from Catherine convinced him to proceed. Jackson found out about their night together when he came to her room to ask for his lucky pencil. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")''\n\nRichard and Catherine didn't regret their night together. Catherine had a short conversation with Jackson where she told him she was a woman with needs. After the boards were over, during their goodbye, Catherine and Richard discovered they were both speaking at an upcoming conference. They compared agendas and made plans to stay in the same hotel. ''(\"[[Let the Bad Times Roll]]\")''\n\nThey continue to develop this relationship. Following the death of [[Adele Webber|his wife]], Catherine sent him a box of cookies and offered companionship. ''(\"[[The End is the Beginning is the End]]\")''\n\nWhen it looked like Seattle Grace Mercy West was going to be sold to Pegasus Horizons, Richard contemplated moving to Boston to be closer to her. However, she suggested the [[Harper Avery Foundation]] could put up the remaining capital they needed in exchange for a seat on the board. ''(\"[[This is Why We Fight]]\")''\n\nWhen Cristina Yang didn't win the Harper Avery Award, Richard Webber came to Boston. He was planning to propose but questioned the foundation's decision to give the award to someone else. When Catherine admitted that she had the votes, but didn't win because the Harper Avery Foundation owns the hospital, he showed her the ring and told her she ruined it and left. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nThey avoided each other during subsequent visits, but when Catherine learned that April and Jackson's baby was going to die, Richard decided to be available in case she needed him. She initially told him she wanted to be alone, but later asked him to take her home and hold her. ''(\"[[All I Could Do Was Cry]]\")''\n\nAfterward, he tried to get her to give Jackson and April space to grieve alone, but she insisted on asked Jackson how April was doing. Richard felt used, believing she'd used visiting him as an excuse to check on April. ''(\"[[The Great Pretender]]\")''\n\nWhen April later called Catherine to the hospital to re-attach a man's penis, Richard tried to stop her. He told Catherine she'd hurt his feelings. She said it had happened with many men before and he said that it would probably happen again, but it was worth the risk. ''(\"[[Crazy Love]]\")''\n\nWhen Richard later tried to propose to her on the th of July, she stopped him before he could get the ring out, saying he shouldn't ask without knowing the answer. However, the following Valentine's Day, she took the reins and proposed to him herself, making it a romantic gesture with candles and roses. He accepted. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\nAfter a tunnel collapse botched their original wedding plans, they married in a small ceremony in the hospital chapel, with the reception following at [[The Dream House]]. Before the wedding, they argued and Catherine took off her ring, but Meredith told them to work it out because they'll never have enough time to be with the people they love. ''(\"[[You're My Home]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship was strained when he learned that she had decided to hire Eliza to replace him, not Bailey. ''(\"[[It Only Gets Much Worse]]\")''\n\nAfter speaking with Bailey about how their lives had taken similar paths and neither of them knew how to be married at first, Catherine went to Richard and admitted she was wrong, starting them on the path to reconciliation. ''(\"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\")''\n\nFor her birthday, Richard took salsa dancing lessons and surprised her at Joe's with a dance in front of their colleagues. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship was strained again when Bailey fired Richard while Catherine watched. Richard was angry with Catherine for not intervening and began to avoid her at home and elsewhere. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\nCatherine came back to town to find Richard sleeping late into the day. He confirmed that he'd worked all night and came home to sleep after breakfast, leaving out that he'd had breakfast with [[Gemma Larson|Gemma]], who kissed him and propositioned him. She told Richard to go back to sleep. ''(\"[[Breathe Again]]\")''\n\nWhile back in Seattle, Catherine went to Pac-North to visit Richard. However, when she asked an intern where his office was, she was upset to learn that he was in his office with a woman the intern believed to be his wife. She told Jackson about this, thinking Richard was cheating on her. Jackson tried to reassure her, but she ended up leaving for Chicago without seeing Richard. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nThings were still tense between them weeks later. She was suspicious when she learned Richard hadn't gone to work one day, even after he told her he'd spent the day with Maggie. She said it was time for them to have a bigger talk. ''(\"[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]]\")''\n\nShe and Richard hosted a dinner to tell Jackson and Maggie that they were separated, but they put it off when Jackson brought guests. After dinner, she and Richard almost stayed together when hearing a sentimental story, but she couldn't apologize. This led to them finally telling everyone at the dinner party about their separation. ''(\"[[The Last Supper]]\")''\n\nCatherine came to the hospital and sat at Richard's bedside while he was sick. When they couldn't figure out what was wrong with him, she wanted to take him home. However, as she prepared to take him home, Meredith noticed a new symptom. He was diagnosed with cobalt poisoning from a hip replacement he'd had three years prior. After he had surgery to remove the bad hip, he quickly improved and pushed Catherine away. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\nThe two of them remained separated until after he returned to work. However, after talked to Jackson and Maggie, he went to Catherine. She fired Tom as Chief of Chiefs and hired Richard in his place. The two of them then reconciled. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nJackson Avery is her son. He gets irritated easily because she butts into his personal life. Even though he didn't tell her Lexie's name when they were dating, she revealed that she knew it and said she had her ways when he questioned her. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\nWhen Jackson started seeing Stephanie, Catherine walked in on the two of them having sex, giving her a bad first impression of Stephanie. After working with Stephanie on a case, however, she agreed to forget the incident and start fresh. ''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\nWhen he eloped with April, she insisted on them drawing up and signing a post-nuptial agreement in order to protect the Avery assets. They did so, forcing themselves to confront how different their plans for their future children were. ''(\"[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]\")''\n\nShe told April that when she was pregnant with him, she was always tired and swollen. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\nShe became a Grandmother when Jackson's daughter with April arrived via emergency c-section.\n\nWhen Jackson visited his father, Robert Avery, Jackson realized that Robert wasn't his dad because he hadn't been involved in his life. When he got back from Montana, he thanked Catherine for everything and hugged her. ''(\"[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]]\")''\n\nParents\nShe lost her mother when she was very young. Then her father died on his way to church when she was , leaving her to raise her sisters on her own. ''(\"[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\")''\n\n\n[[Michelle Velez]]\nShe and Michelle are long-time friends. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\n[[Tom Koracick]]\nShe has a history with Koracick. They flirted a little bit when they ran into each other again at the hospital and she invited him to return for lectures in the future. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\nTom later told Meredith that Catherine was the one who woke him back up after his son died, reminding him that he was still alive and shouldn't sleepwalk through his life. ''(\"[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\")''\n\n\nCatherine is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Urology|urologist]] at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]]. She is also the chairman of the board of the Catherine Fox Foundation.\n\nShe occasionally consulted at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] and performed the country's first penile transplant there. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\nIn , she served as a [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|board examiner]] in San Francisco, CA. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")'' Between  and , Catherine Avery joined the surgical staff of [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], at least part-time, as she has scheduled surgeries when she's in Seattle.\n\n\n*When Catherine visits, she brings her own lab coat from [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]]. She also sometimes wears a lab coat issued from [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]; however, as of [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season twelve]], Catherine exclusively wears her GSM lab coat.\n*Catherine

Sabrina had been diagnosed with a biatrial myxoma three weeks prior and decided she wanted to go to Seattle for treatment instead of Chicago, which is where her father wanted her to go. They went to Grey Sloan, not knowing that Richard didn't work there anymore. Maggie overheard them talking to a nurse and went to talk to them. She learned who they were and that they knew who she was, though she'd never heard of them. She drove them over to Pac-North to see Richard, where she revealed a picture of her tumor. Maggie did an exam and sent Sabrina to get new scans, since the type of tumor she had can grow quickly. The scan showed significant growth, which made her surgery emergent. Maggie wanted to operate right away, but Sabrina had reservations about Maggie operating because of their relationship. Maggie wasn't concerned about it, but Sabrina insisted, so Richard called the on-call cardiothoracic surgeon. Before the surgeon could arrive, Sabrina coded, so Maggie rushed her into surgery. While Sabrina was in surgery, Chris and Richard alternated between tense and amiable conversation, with the latter aided by the presence of Catherine, who had come to support Richard.

Despite this, he continued to track her care. Maggie planned to do a pericardial window to remove the shoe, but when she was called away for an emergency, Richard did the surgery instead, despite knowing Gemma wouldn't want that. After her surgery, Richard went to Gemma and told her what happened. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\n\nGemma and Richard saw each other again when he found out she was working at the same hospital he was, a job he helped her get. At the end of a difficult day, Gemma invited Richard to go talk over dinner and he accepted. ''(\"[[Reunited]]\")''\n\n\nGemma came in one day to pick up her paycheck and ran into Richard, who was leaving after an overnight surgery. She insisted on him coming to breakfast with her before going home. At the breakfast, Gemma came onto him, saying she could help him relieve some tension because he was fighting with his wife. He pulled away from her advances and left abruptly after she kissed him. She followed him out and reminded him of his history of infidelity in his marriage to Adele. Richard told her that what she was saying was not sober talk and advised her to call her sponsor and get herself to a meeting before he left. ''(\"[[Breathe Again]]\")''\n\nAfter what happened, she apologized to Richard and asked to make it up to him over coffee. He said it wasn't a good idea. Later, Gemma came to Richard while was waiting for his niece to get out of surgery. She comforted him, but they were interrupted by Catherine, who had come to sit with Richard. Gemma quickly left. Later, she saw Catherine outside and asked how Sabi was doing. Catherine said she was still in surgery and then said that the Fox Foundation is always looking for accountants to help manage their money. They have lots of openings, but none in Seattle. She suggested that Gemma put in her resume. ''(\"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\")''\n\nIn the aftermath of Sabrina's death, Gemma continued to check on Richard. They held a meeting together in his office, where they talked about the loss and prayed together. However, an intern who came in to ask Richard a question believed that Gemma was his wife, a supposition he passed on to Catherine. While leaving the hospital with Gemma, Richard got a text that Catherine was heading to Chicago. He hadn't even been aware she was in Seattle.

Everything was going well until Ben did a pelvic exam after her water broke. He was able to feel the baby's foot and the cord, which had no pulse. April insisted that Ben do an emergency c-section at the house. Using a kitchen knife and with help from Arizona over the phone, he delivered the baby. They were then taken to the hospital. After April was out of surgery, she held her newborn baby. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\nLater, as April healed, Catherine came to visit and held her new granddaughter. April then informed her that they had named the baby Harriet. Catherine loved the name, but disliked it when April told her the baby's last name wouldn't be Avery.

He is also a former member of the board and the de facto board chairman. Jackson was married to\ua[[April Kepner]] with whom he has a daughter and a deceased son. He relocated to Boston to take over the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]] and work towards achieving equity in medical care. A newly divorced April and their daughter, [[Harriet Kepner-Avery|Harriet]] moved with him so he could continue being an active and present father. While in Boston, he and April rekindled their romance.\n\n\n\nJackson is the grandson of\ua[[Harper Avery|Dr. Harper Avery]], one of the most famous surgeons in the country and the namesake of the prestigious Harper Avery Award. He grew up hearing about the nobility of being a surgeon at his grandfather's dinner table, which inspired him to become a surgeon. His family never pushed him academically, so he pushed himself; he didn't even tell his family that he had taken the MCAT until he aced it.\n\nNot much is known about Jackson's life before he became a surgeon, but it is known that although he looks up to [[Harper Avery|his grandfather]], he detests being compared to him. He also refuses to use his name in order to progress in his career. Jackson is no doubt a \"mama's boy\" and is extremely protective of the people he cares about \u specifically [[April Kepner]], whom he claims is his only remaining friend in [[Seattle]].\n\n\nDuring the shooting at the hospital, Jackson and Cristina performed emergency surgery on [[Derek Shepherd]], saving his life. At one point during the surgery, grieving widower, [[Gary Clark]] held them at gunpoint. Jackson saved everyone\us lives by making it seem as though Derek had flatlined. This pleased [[Gary Clark]] and he was then convinced to leave them in peace.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\nBefore the shooting, Jackson was friends with fellow Mercy West resident, Charles Percy. Percy was killed during the shooting and this had a great impact on Jackson. For months following the shooting, he had nightmares about the event. He and April Kepner also moved into Meredith's house as both their friends had been killed and Meredith felt they needed support.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\nThere was later a shooting at a local college and Jackson, alongside Drs. Altman and Yang found out they were operating on the shooter. He refused to continue and walked out of the OR, likely a response to the Gary Clark shooting. However, he's later admonished by Alex, who reminds him that mass shooters are sick people with a family that still love them. After this, Jackson sits down with the shooter's mother and reassures her that her son was still alive.<ref>[[Disarm]], x</ref>\n\n\nAt the request of Mark, Jackson attempted to get close to Lexie as Mark wanted to find out if she was miserable without him. However, Lexie and Jackson\uaactually grew closer to one another and eventually had sex in the shower, which marked the start of their relationship. Mark didn't want to let go of Lexie but eventually did so, though Jackson kept noticing that Lexie couldn't seem to get over him, despite her claims that she had. When Mark noticed Jackson's interest in and talent for plastic surgery, Jackson decided to pursue that specialty. However, he avoided surgery with Mark because of Lexie's lingering feelings for Mark. This bugged him and he decided to break up with Lexie. He offered her the chance to tell him that he shouldn't do it, but she couldn't bring herself to do so.\n\nJackson then dove into plastics and quickly formed The Plastics Posse with Mark, who was eager to teach him.\n\n\nAfter Arizona, Derek, Meredith and Cristina sued Seattle Grace Mercy West because of the plane crash, the hospital was forced to pay out a multi-million dollar settlement. After Owen and [[Alana Cahill]] tried to made some cost-cutting changes, they determined it wasn't enough and they'd be forced to sell the hospital. Alana brokered a deal to sell to Pegasus while the doctors from the settlement worked together to come up with the money they needed to buy it themselves. To stop the deal from going through before they could get the money together, they quit en masse, causing Pegasus to pull out of the deal. They then went to Catherine Avery, who put up the rest of the money and helped them purchase the hospital. As part of the deal, she put Jackson on the hospital board.\n\n\nOn the day of April's wedding, Jackson runs into April at the hospital as she is looking for Meredith and Cristina and asks him if he is coming to her wedding. After realizing that she really wants him there, Jackson decides to go. When Jackson and Stephanie arrive at April's wedding, Jackson picks up a box that contains a butterfly and as it flies into the air, Jackson remembers what April told him about wanting butterflies at her wedding, but brushes it off. As April is walking down the aisle, Jackson smiles at the beautiful bride. When the priest asks everyone if they agree to support Matthew and April's marriage, April locks eyes with Jackson as he begins to realize what is really happening. Everyone says yes except Jackson. He then turns to Stephanie and says \"I'm sorry\" then stands up then sits back down. Finally, Jackson takes a deep breath and stands up again and says,\ua\"I love you. I always have. I love everything about you - even the things that I don't like, I love. And I want you with me. I love you and I think that you love me, too. Do you?\" Matthew is visibly upset, Jackson looks scared and vulnerable, and April looks like she is in shock and takes a deep breath.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nNot too long after their wedding, Jackson and April got into a fight about how they would raise their hypothetical children, especially regarding religion and beliefs. April was offended and felt that Jackson loved her despite her religion and therefore just tolerated her. April then left their home and went to live with Arizona and Callie for a while.\n\nUpon running into April as she came to retrieve her iPod, Jackson expressed regret over the ridiculing her beliefs. He said they loved one another and made vows to push through conversations like this, as it was one they would have to have at some point. He stressed they ultimately shared the same values. She agreed, except that he would not agree if she were to tell their future children that their Creator loved. He asked her to take a break from their hypothetical children, but she revealed they couldn't as she was pregnant.\n\nThe couple\uastarted to prepare for their child. Their world was shattered when Jackson overheard a conversation between Stephanie and Nicole Herman about their son, as they discussed the possibility of the baby suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta. Jackson had to break the news to April, who avoided it by diving into work. At the end of the day, Jackson took her outside to talk and she broke down in his arms as she revealed the sex of their baby to him. They then consulted with Arizona and Nicole to find out which type of OI their baby was suffering from. Unfortunately, their son was diagnosed with type II, meaning he would die mere hours after birth and was also at risk for intrauterine fractures. Guided by Catherine, Jackson and April decided to induce labor, baptize their boy, and hold him until his final breath. April initially agreed to the plan, but she took her faith and started praying for a miracle. Jackson brought up that wouldn't happen and April revealed her anger and disappointment in\uaGod. Jackson then went to the chapel to ask God to show up for April. April found her faith again through a patient who had lost her husband earlier that day. She then decided to name their boy Samuel Norbert Avery, the final step she had to take to come to terms with the plan. Jackson agreed to the name and their plan was put into motion. Jackson and April held their son and soaked in every moment with him until his passing. Afterward, Jackson took April home, where he continued to care for her. He decided to give her space as he felt she needed it in order to come to terms with what had happened.\n\nApril first returned to the hospital for Nicole's surgery. Jackson stayed by her side all day until he went to check on a patient of his in the ICU. She returned to work not long after, and choose to avoid dealing with her pain by becoming a tougher version of herself. She wanted to have sex all the time, which had Jackson worried, but she assured him she didn't need the space and that she was still herself.\uaJackson filled the void in his life by turning to teaching, recruiting Ben to join the new version of the Plastics Posse.\n\n\nApril joined the army as a doctor and did a tour in Jordan with Owen Hunt. While she was gone her marriage with Jackson deteriorated. She became pregnant with their second child, Harriet, and they later divorced and have joint custody of their daughter.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Jackson meets his father.]]\nJackson tracked down his father and took a case in the nearby\ua[[Avery Medical Center--Bozeman]]. He requested Meredith to join him, but knowing the real reason behind his trip, Catherine had April take her place as she would offer a better support system. After hitting a dead end on the case, Jackson spent the night at his father's diner and got drunk. April eventually found him there, but he yelled at her and left. April ended up talking with Robert Avery and discovered his identity. She then went to confront Jackson about this and pressed him to talk to his father. Jackson went to do so and told him the truth. They sat down and Jackson updated him\uaabout his life. Robert talked about how he met Catherine and how he walked out because of her crushing expectations. Jackson was overwhelmed and left after realizing Robert didn't know who he was as a person. After coming up with a fix for the case, Jackson returned to the diner to tell his father that he was glad they met, but there wouldn't be a next time because Robert broke the promise you make when you become a parent. He told Robert he wasn't his father and left.<ref>[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing the death of his grandfather, Jackson inherited a quarter billion dollars. He bought a boat to relax on and then decided that he felt sidetracked lately, so he talked to Bailey and asked her to accept a large donation in order to set up a surgical contest that would fund projects rather than just award one surgeon like the Harper Avery Award. His name couldn't be anywhere near it since he wanted to participate. Bailey accepted and later got Richard to run it, since she wanted to participate, too.\n\nJackson also realized he had feelings for Maggie, and after learning that she reciprocated them, they began a relationship. After Maggie saved April's life, his and Maggie's relationship deepened, especially after April left the hospital and got remarried to Matthew. Though Jackson and Maggie hit a bump in their relationship over Jackson's newfound interest in religion and faith, they eventually reconciled when they learned about Catherine's tumor. Maggie helped Jackson through the process, using the death of her own mother as a guide.\n\n\nJackson prayed to God to bring April back after she fell into a ravine with a river that left her asystolic and severely hypothermic. She recovered without deficits. That left Jackson to look for spirituality in his own life.\n\nThe day after Alex and Jo's wedding, he noticed a hungover Maggie and Andrew and wondered why people numb life's most beautiful moments with alcohol. He decided they would all walk to work together to enjoy the weather. He was intrigued by April's spontaneous wedding, as their own wedding had been, too, and wondered if that was how faith worked. Andrew pulled him and Maggie out of the way of a car that was about to hit them. While checking on [[Cece Colvin|the driver]] and [[Nisha]], who was hit, Jackson thanked Andrew for saving their lives. At the hospital, Jackson worked on Nisha's leg and he wondered if Nisha getting hit by her own matchmaker was the beginning of a chain of events that were meant to be, even hinting that God may be behind it, working in mysterious ways. That night at home, Jackson confided in Maggie that, much to his own surprise, he had started to believe in something and that he felt it pulsating through him. He wanted to leap and trust that something would catch him as April and Matthew did. Maggie pointed out they got married. He said he wanted to trust it. Thinking he was proposing, Maggie claimed they were out of milk and ran out.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nJackson himself returned to the hospital because Nisha spiked a fever. Nisha flirted with him. Jackson had to resuscitate Cece while Nisha also became tachycardic and eventually septic. Jackson and Meredith agreed Cece was too aggressive with her matchmaking attempts. Nisha was found to have necrotizing fasciitis. He and Levi debrided her wound in the hyperbaric chamber and Jackson found out through him that Maggie was avoiding him because she thought he had proposed. Unfortunately, Nisha went into V-fib. Jackson performed CPR for  minutes before calling the time of death. Distraught over the loss and the apparent lack of a deeper meaning behind the accident, he wanted to get out, but he had to wait for the chamber to depressurize. After work, Jackson and Maggie talked. He had trouble understanding why they got to live while Nisha didn't. Maggie suggested he had some PTSD after his family empire crumbled and April leaving. Jackson pointed out there were also good things in his life and told her that he loved her. She reciprocated. He apologized for the accidental proposal and said he had some stuff to figure out.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nHe decided to go on a spontaneous spiritual quest. He took a leave of absence and left Maggie a voice mail to tell her he needed to take a step back from his life and look at the bigger picture. He didn't tell her face to face because he knew he couldn't leave if he saw her face when he told her he needed time to find answers to his big life questions.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref> He traveled to national parks to find himself in nature. He sent Maggie a picture of a tree.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nHe briefly returned to the hospital to operate on [[Rafi Elshami]], a boy with extensive scapular osteochondroma. Rafi and his father Aamir shared their s'mores with him by a creek in Oregon so in return, Jackson arranged the surgery pro bono. Before surgery, he invited Maggie to talk over dinner, but she avoided him with her patients as an excuse. Pathology revealed the tumors were malignant, so they prepared to remove the scapula altogether, but Maggie inspired Jackson to try extracorporeal radiation to save Rafi's mobility. The plan worked. Afterward, Jackson visited Maggie in her lab and told her he was done with his trips as doing his work made him feel more connected to something larger than him, and Maggie was a huge part of that. He apologized for the way he left so abruptly. She forgave him and they shared a kiss.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref> He remained on his best behavior to make up for his trips by bringing Maggie coffee and food in her lab. On Day of the Dead, she found herself missing her mother and wanting to be alone, so he gave her some time while bringing marigolds to the lab.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nTheir relationship flourished until Maggie saw texts from a woman named Kate on his phone that included heart emojis. Maggie assumed he was cheating, but he explained he was just a friend he had met during his nature trips. The nature helped him with his PTSD and he ran into Kate, who was doing similar trips to process her brother's death. He showed her all the texts and explained it was nice to talk to people who had been through the same as him. She inquired about those people and he admitted he still talked to April from time to time. Maggie admitted she never pictured him blowing up their relationship. He was surprised she ever pictured their relationship ending. Jackson then confessed he talked to other women because Maggie never shared her feelings about anything. Maggie told him that she imagined he'd find a priest on his spiritual quest and come back with answers, but instead, he came back with more questions, which he then took to other women. She had always been five steps ahead of everyone in her life, which is why she never learned to communicate her feelings, but now she felt like he was five steps ahead of her and she didn't know how to catch up. She inquired about what he talked about with Kate. He replied that the only thing he and April never saw eye to eye on was God and now that he finally believed, April had married someone else. He had realized he needed to grieve the end of that marriage and what Harriet had lost because of it, and he didn't know how to talk to Maggie about it. Upset, Maggie got her stuff and left the penthouse.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Maggie tells Jackson about his mother's cancer.]]\nWith a windstorm heading towards the city, Jackson avoided Maggie at work. He scrubbed in with Teddy and Owen and witnessed her telling him about her pregnancy with his child. Owen was baffled while Teddy was paged away to the ER, but Jackson told him that even though he was the last to find out about Harriet, it was the best thing that ever happened to him. Jackson's patient and his wife had a tumultuous history with lots of fighting, which made Jackson find Maggie to discuss their first big fight. However, Jackson was surprised when Maggie told him that his mother had a grade III chondrosarcoma on her spine.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nShe showed him the scans and he felt helpless. Jackson tried to reach his mother, but it went straight to voicemail. He then focused on getting the elevators back on, which had been stuck ever since a power outage caused by the storm. Jackson saved [[Jed Lundberg|Jed Lundberg's]] legs when they were crushed when an elevator suddenly started working again. Afterward, Jackson found Richard and inquired if he had heard from Catherine at all. Since he hadn't, Jackson took him someplace quiet to tell about her cancer.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nRichard and Jackson had dinner with Catherine as soon as she flew back to Seattle, but they avoided talking about the cancer. Jackson had a hard time accepting the diagnosis, rendering him unable to properly share his feelings with Maggie. The next day, they had a special pelvic exenteration together that would spare the uterus using a technique developed by Catherine. In surgery, the doctors hit a snag when the uterine tissue proved too friable to spare the uterus, disrupting their entire plan. They performed a hysterectomy. Catherine angrily left the OR when Jackson suggested taking over for her. After the surgery, he and Richard found Catherine fuming in a lounge. She said she hadn't told them because she wasn't ready to talk to them about it yet, because it would make the cancer painfully real for her. They assured her they could handle the bad news and that they would support her as her family. She then broke down as reality hit her and they comforted her.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of the surgery, Jackson visited Catherine with Harriet. She asked him and Richard to refrain from being doctors around her and instead support her as her son and husband. Tom and Amelia came in to explain their approach. Catherine needed a moment to herself and went to an empty OR. Jackson followed her there and she shared that ever since her first solo surgery, she had been singing \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" in her head to help her get through stressful situations. He said he had sung to himself, too, in his first solo surgery. She revealed she had snuck into the gallery to see it and they made a deal to sneak into the gallery together to see Harriet's first surgery. Afterward, Catherine gave Jackson documents declaring him the leader of the Foundation in case she didn't make it out alive as well as a detailed party plan in case the surgery would be a success. Jackson then walked her back to her room. Right before the surgery, Jackson surprised her by playing \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" in the OR. After a dance with the entire staff, Catherine got settled on the table.\n\nA nervous Jackson kept pacing up in the gallery. While he wanted to see, he grew increasingly frustrated by Tom's laid-back attitude and took a walk. He sat down on a gurney and Maggie sat down with him. He told her his mother had always been larger than life. He couldn't imagine a room without her in it after all the meddling she had done in his life and thinking about her not being there made him feel like a scared little kid. She understood the feeling and comforted him as he broke down in tears. The surgery went relatively well, leaving behind a small piece of the tumor as to not damage Catherine's brachial plexus and save her career. Catherine was relieved that they saved her life and her career and announced that they would still have the success party, albeit in a few months so that she could dance. Later that night, Maggie brought Jackson a beverage as he sat by his mother's side.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Catherine was positive right after the surgery, her attitude worsened as she was facing a tough recovery over the holidays. She went to bed early on Christmas Eve and continued to refuse help. Jackson and Maggie attended the Karevs' NYE party, but Maggie noticed his head was elsewhere, so they went home to watch the ball drop from their bed. During one of their visits to Catherine and Richard's house, Jackson and Maggie witnessed as Catherine fell on the treadmill and broke down crying. Jackson couldn't stand to see her like that and went to take a walk in the garden. Maggie suggested a movie night to celebrate Valentine's Day to distract him. She knew he was hurting but didn't know how to make it better. He didn't know either. She confessed she had a fleeting thought of wanting to kill herself in the worst moments of her mother's illness and how the pain and fear were so strong that she experienced physical discomforts, which Jackson recognized.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie worked on sharing her feelings more, which Jackson appreciated. Jackson saved the hand of a kid who got shot at a parade, which added to Jackson's fear of Harriet getting shot in public.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref> Jackson surprised Maggie by turning a weekend away she agreed to into a camping trip. He packed his car with supplies and assured her she'd love it. However, Maggie canceled the trip when she decided to stay to support Amelia, who was having a rough time when Betty turned up amongst the overdoses flooding the ER. Jackson took care of an unhoused man's injured feet and felt guilty for having talked about his camping trip and three pairs of ski boots in front of him. He tried to find a shelter for him so he could continue to care for his feet but to no avail. He then decided to give Ralph all of his camping equipment, hoping it would last him through the waitlist period before landing a place at a shelter.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nJackson hosted a party for Catherine at his penthouse in honor of Amelia and Tom, whom he didn't particularly like given his history with April. Catherine didn't want to attend and took a long time to get there. When she finally did, Jackson gathered everyone for a speech, but it was interrupted by Tom and Owen fighting and then smoke coming from the kitchen. The penthouse was evacuated and Ben later informed Jackson they found plastic in the oven. Out on the street, Catherine told her son she hadn't meant to be ungrateful. She then suggested the two of them and Richard and Maggie celebrate in the limo, which they did with burgers, fries, and champagne. Having learned to enjoy every moment from Bailey, Catherine decided she wanted to celebrate every scan with her family that way.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the fire, Jackson temporarily moved in with Maggie and her sisters and cooked them dinner. At work, Jo was ranting about how Alex's mother was pushing her to have kids now and how kids were terrible, which offended Jackson. She later apologized and he told her that kids can give you a reason to live when life tries to ruin you.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nAs part of his spray-on skin research, Jackson initiated a project with tilapia skin to treat severe burns with less scarring than the usual methods. Meanwhile, he supported Maggie as she prepared herself to appear on Good Morning Seattle to talk about herself after she let slip her parentage in a medical podcast, which made for big news in the medical community. During Maggie's interview, Jo took it as a sign that she needed to find her own parents. Jackson warned her it could go badly, citing his own experience with his father, which only caused him more pain. Afterward, Maggie visited him in his lab. While kissing, they got a little competitive over their innovative projects, both striving to be the best.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine's road to recovery remained difficult. She opted not to return to work when planned, only telling her family \"cancer card.\" Jackson worried about her and started thinking Richard was keeping something from him about her, but Richard assured him that wasn't true. They worked on a gender non-binary patient together, which required Jackson to teach Richard the right pronouns.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and Meredith lured Catherine back to work with a triple transplant patient, for whom they finally found a match. The transplant included the abdominal wall, a penis, and a scrotum. Jackson and Meredith teamed up to go retrieve the organs at another hospital. On their trip, Meredith shared that Richard had caught her and Andrew together at the party and that she was nervous because Richard was overseeing Andrew's first solo surgery. Jackson remembered him walking in on him and Maggie once, so he could imagine how nervous Andrew would be. The procurement went well, but when they returned, they discovered Catherine had called off the surgery because the patient had lied about his support system, which she had come to value a great deal since her cancer. Owen talked with the patient and convinced Catherine to move forward with the surgery. While operating, Jackson told Meredith that was he was constantly worrying over Catherine and how he also worried about how it affected Richard, as Meredith did. During the last part, Catherine promised Jackson she wouldn't keep it from him if she got worse. He appreciated that and she thanked him for the surgery.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nOn Jo's first day back, Jackson invited her to help him out on her project since Meredith asked him to check up on her. He brought up her having met her birth mother, but she didn't want to talk about it. He insisted and she said she shouldn't have gone looking like he told her to. He replied she went looking anyway so she must have felt like she needed to do it. Looking back, she didn't understand why because she had everything and she threw it all away for nothing. He pointed out she still had everything, but she knew Alex wasn't happy with her anymore and she was convinced talking to him about her experience would only hurt more. Jackson revealed he knew that she was drunk and, after she refused to talk any more, told her she would not be met with compassion if she ever came to work drunk again. Jackson informed Alex about what happened. Inspired by Jo, he sought out Maggie in her blue room and asked her to move in with him because he did not want to take love for granted.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie didn't accept right away because she wanted to talk it over with Meredith first. Jackson didn't understand why she needed her permission, but Maggie just wanted to clear it with her first because Meredith depended on her with the kids and she was a buffer between her and Amelia sometimes. After a conversation with [[Lucas Ripley]], she came to tell him that the only right answer was yes. She just needed him to weigh the pros and cons with her, because that was who she is and she wanted to make sure that he could accept her being her. Jackson agreed, but again invited her to go camping with him first.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\n\nThey went on their trip. He poured her coffee in the mornings and they made out in their tent. While not entirely enthusiastic, she agreed to go hiking with him so he could show her a special spot. He appreciated her doing her best and she enjoyed seeing him in his element. Their hike was cut short when she was bitten by a bug and twisted her ankle while running away from it. They made it back to the tent to take care of the swollen bite while she had decided that they should just accept what the other person liked and not try to get the other one to like it, too. They then found out that Alex had been trying to reach her for their shared patient [[Gus Carter]]. Maggie decided they needed to go, but while packing up their stuff, they received word that Teddy had gone into labor, meaning her service was no longer covered. They decided to leave their stuff behind and come back for it later, but a downpour prevented them from taking off.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nThey waited it out in their tent and took off for the car. While walking, she had trouble trusting he knew the way and freaked out when he slipped and fell into a creek, which sparked a fight between them. She blamed him for forcing her to come with while he hated how she was assigning blame to him for everything while he just wanted her to come explore something he loved. He ended up carrying her and said he only wanted her to expand, not change. He suggested she had missed out on some aspects of life while buried in books during her formative years. She fired back that they were in this situation because his privilege prevented him from learning about consequences. She said the money couldn't get them to Gus. He was offended at her calling him \"Mr. Monopoly\" and concluded she did not respect him while she realized he didn't like her for who she was.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jackson decides to head out into the fog.]]\nThey made it to the car, but they got stuck in traffic caused by thick fog covering the city. He grabbed a flashlight and headed out to explore the situation, telling her to stay in the car where she was safe and knew exactly what would happen in the near future. She watched him disappear into the fog. When he didn't return for quite some time, she went after him and called his name, but he didn't respond.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nDuring his walk, he heard [[Mari Prishna]] calling for help and found her holding onto a rope that was attached to her unconscious husband [[Jai Prishna]], who was dangling off the edge of a cliff with broken legs. Jackson took over for her and called . Maggie went to look for him. She found him right when [[Victoria Hughes]] arrived on the aid car with supplies. Together, they pulled Jai up and transported him to the hospital. After Jai and Mari were taken into the ER, Jackson and Maggie sat in the ambulance in silence. They agreed to let their tempers settle before talking about their fight. Jackson worked on both Mari and Jai with Link and they managed to save them. A week later, Jackson tried to talk to Maggie, but she was still angry at him for abandoning her in the car on an unfamiliar road in the woods, so they planned on talking later.\n\nA week later, Jai suffered from what appeared to be a stroke. While studying their scans, Maggie came in and Jackson told her that Mari had held onto Jai for so long that a tree sliced up her nerves and almost cut off her arm, only for him to end up on life support after excruciating surgeries. They knew there was something broken beyond repair in Jai that landed him there, but they had no idea what. It made Jackson wonder if Mari should have let go back at the cliff. Maggie realized he meant that their relationship had broken beyond repair and that he wanted to let go.\n\nJackson ran into Vic in the ambulance bay and thanked her for helping him back at that cliff. She stated she was just doing her job, but she appreciated hearing how Mari and Jai were doing. Jackson invited her for burgers, but she had to work. They did meet up for lunch after a week. He talked about the fat embolus syndrome that they had diagnosed Jai with. Then they both admitted they were just getting out of a serious relationship and that it wasn't a good time to start something new. The experimental protocol that the doctors had started was a success and Jai recovered without deficits. Jackson shared the good news with Vic, which Maggie witnessed. She asked him how long this thing between him and Vic had been going on. He told her they were just friends, even though it was none of her business. She agreed since they didn't like each other and therefore were not friends anymore.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after the breakup, Jackson shared a post on social media with #Freedom. Maggie was bitter because of this and mocked Victoria's intellect, stating he now got to feel superior all the time instead of dating an intellectually challenging woman. He learned Bailey had taken action to improve the residents' skills and Tom added to Jackson's dislike of him by dismissing teaching residents. Per Meredith's request, Jackson performed a biopsy of a nodule in [[Robin (Season )|Robin's]] neck. He also assured Levi he would cover for him if Bailey were to discover he had brought hospital supplies to Meredith for her street clinic, stating he was not afraid of getting in trouble if it allowed Meredith to help people. The biopsy revealed cancer, which, while treatable, faced Robin with the choice between bankruptcy and death, confirming Jackson had been right to help Meredith out. Later, he ran into Maggie and told her that she had been wrong about Vic, who was smart and brave. Maggie apologized for her mean comments but pointed out his post was spiteful, even if he hadn't meant it that way.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and Vic continued to spend more time together. They went hiking together and she impressed him with her strength by removing a fallen tree from the path by herself. Later, he ran into her after she had dropped off a patient at the ER and noticed she had a facial lac. He suggested he stitch it up, eager to show her his skills. While suturing, he countered her teasing him about being stronger than him by stating his training was about zeroing in on the smallest detail. He flirtatiously said it was his job to take care of his patients' every need. After he finished, she pulled him in and kissed. He suggested they take it slow but neither was in the mood to do that, so they continued to make out.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWhen an article was published under Meredith's name that inadvertently trashed Grey Sloan, Tom arranged for Jackson to do a pro bono surgery on a -year-old girl with a severe case of craniosynostosis in exchange for the parents allowing them to film the surgery and the family's experience to get the hospital some positive, free publicity, which he hated. Throughout the day, Jackson noticed Tom was more concerned about getting good footage for the report than putting the parents at ease, so after Jo pointed out Meredith was doing the right thing without worrying about optics, Jackson decided to do the same. He replaced Tom with Amelia and operated on the girl pro bono without filming it as he knew they were actually uncomfortable with that. During surgery, Tom burst in and tried to pull rank to step in for Amelia and bring in the camera crew. However, Jackson said he himself was the Foundation and also the majority shareholder of the hospital, pointing out that he was, in fact, Tom's boss, and forced him to leave. The surgery was pulled off without a hitch. Later, when he was checking up on the girl in post-op, Vic stopped by and admitted she was impressed by his work. They then went for dinner in the cafeteria together.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Jackson treated [[Mary Rose Hawkins-Garrett]], who suffered from xeroderma pigmentosum and had burns from apparent UV exposure, even though she maintained she hadn't been exposed. He had to disappoint Mary Rose by telling her she wouldn't get to leave in time for trick-or-treating but assured her the parade on the peds floor was great. Levi informed him there was no parade since Alex was gone so Jackson bestowed that task onto him. After surgery, Jackson again tried to get Mary Rose to admit that she had been exposed but she only said she wanted Alex, who had treated her before. Jackson then did his best Alex impression, which made her laugh. She then admitted she had been exposed when she was chasing her new cat. Jackson said this was her one pass. He used this case to point out to Andrew, who had been having trouble with Zola, that kids always have a reason for their behavior.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nWhen his mother came back into town, Maggie approached him to talk. He tried to brush her off but she insisted on talking. She told him Catherine was still unaware of their break-up. They started bickering until Maggie noticed a woman she thought had a striking resemblance to her. Jackson commented he'd have to see her scowl first.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nJackson came to support Meredith at her hearing before the medical commission. While there, he ran into Richard, who had just returned to town after Sabrina's funeral. Richard told him his family wasn't ready to see anyone from Seattle, which is why he hadn't reached out. Jackson was surprised to learn that his mother hadn't attended the funeral either. Jackson followed the hearing, which was interrupted when [[Paul Castello]] had a seizure. During the recess, Jackson found a drunk Maggie in the hotel bar beating herself up over Sabrina's death. He decided to take her home. Over wine, he asked her about Richard and Catherine but she didn't know anything about their problems. Jackson then got a text that Meredith got to keep her license. Maggie realized she hadn't helped at all but he pointed out she had helped by not testifying drunk. They laughed, which led to his admitting that he missed talking with her about their lives. They nearly kissed until he said he couldn't. She then threw him out.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine caught Jackson leaning into Vic in the ambulance bay. She introduced herself to Catherine and left on the aid car. Catherine commented on his getting cozy with the paramedic. He later found her in a conference room and clarified that he wasn't cheating as he and Maggie had broken up months ago. He promised her it wouldn't affect her marriage but Catherine wasn't sure how long he'd still have to worry about that. She told him about Gemma. Jackson likened it to her past with Tom but she pointed out she didn't have a history of cheating. Jackson tried to reassure her and pointed out that she had a habit of retreating when she had an idea in her head that she didn't like. When she said they hadn't spoken in weeks, he asked if they hadn't spoken or if she just hadn't listened. He met up with her again later at the bar after she went to see Richard. She downed an entire gin and tonic when she entered the bar and ordered three more. She told him that he had Gemma in his office and that an intern called Gemma Richard's wife. Jackson tried to calm her down and said it sounded more like a miscommunication, also adding that those problems began when she stood back and let Bailey fire him. She didn't like his defending Richard and brought up his new girlfriend. Jackson pointed out it wasn't relevant to her business but she disagreed since he had chosen to date her husband's daughter. He wasn't willing to be held responsible for both her and his own relationships. Jackson was still at the bar when a car suddenly crashed into it.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter working the frontlines during the COVID- pandemic, Jackson was confronted with severe racial inequity in medicine. He began to wonder why the Foundation had not done more and collaborated with [[Alma Ortiz]] to come up with ideas to help the underprivileged citizens of Seattle. When he confronted Catherine about her neglecting his pitches, she pointed out all the work they had accomplished through the Foundation and said change takes time. He was not satisfied and began pondering possibilities to make serious changes. He got the idea to take over the Foundation from his mother and move to Boston, leaving behind his life and surgical career. He took a sudden leave of absence and sought out his father to see if walking away from his life was the right path for him. His father reinforced his plan. Jackson drove home to tell his mother that he was taking over the Foundation and then went to see April and ask her to move her family to Boston with him since he could not leave Harriet behind, like his father had left him. April was not supportive of his plan since he was uprooting his whole life and asked her to do the same over something that he had actively rejected for as long as she had known him. However, after his passionate speeches about his ideas, she agreed to make the move with him and revealed that she and Matthew had split up during the pandemic. They were excited for new horizons and started planning their move to Boston.\n\n\nAs a child, Jackson often listened to stories about his grandfather, [[Harper Avery]], and ever since then, he has always wanted to be a surgeon. Jackson is very forward, often saying what's on his mind even if it hurts someone's feelings. He is also intelligent, kind, and very protective of the people he cares about like his mother, [[Catherine Fox]], and his best friend and later wife, [[April Kepner]].\n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nWhen Jackson first arrived at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], he developed a small crush on [[Cristina Yang]] and kissed her while inebriated at a party. However, Cristina did not return any intimate feelings towards him. Instead, she broke the kiss immediately and told him that it never happened.\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nJackson and [[Lexie Grey]] developed a relationship after [[Mark Sloan]] bribed Jackson with surgery in exchange for information on how Lexie was doing. Jackson got the information he wanted but didn't tell Mark about it because he'd developed feelings for Lexie and wanted to respect her privacy. Mark did, however, still allow Jackson to perform the surgery he was promised. Lexie and Jackson eventually became a couple, sleeping together all over the hospital and Meredith's house, very much to April's dismay. They attended Callie and Arizona's wedding together.<ref>[[White Wedding]], x</ref> However, when Jackson's mother came to town, Jackson sent Lexie to go visit her sister Molly in fear that his mother would somehow ruin their relationship.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref> Throughout their relationship, Lexie's ex-boyfriend and mentor to Jackson, [[Mark Sloan]] was still in love with Lexie and was uneasy seeing the two together. Lexie and Jackson broke up when Jackson realized that Lexie was still in love with Mark.\n\n[[Mara Keaton]]\nWhen Catherine Avery came to SGMW for a bladder transplant, she brought along Mara Keaton, a Urology fellow at [[Massachusetts General Hospital|Mass Gen]]. Catherine asked Jackson to tour Mara around the hospital, which made him suspect that his mother was pushing him into a relationship with her. Mara felt that Catherine could be really annoying also. He encouraged Mara to stand up to his mother. Mara did stand up to her, but Catherine was not mad at Mara. Jackson was pleased with what Mara had done and after that, he slept with her in the on-call room.<ref>[[One Step Too Far]], x</ref>\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nOn the night before his [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]], Jackson and [[April Kepner]] engage in a bar fight and later have sex. Jackson was leery at first, due to the fact that April was a virgin, but she promised him it was okay and she wanted to do it. Later, however, April told Jackson that the reason she had been a virgin so long is that she was celibate. She was completely heartbroken and distraught at what happened between them, which caused Jackson to feel extremely guilty. They had another sexual encounter in the men\us room during a break from their\uamedical board exams, which helped both Jackson and April calm down.<ref>[[Let the Bad Times Roll]], x</ref> However, it was too late for April and she failed. When she was let go from the hospital, Jackson comforted her, but April perceived it as him pitying her and told him to leave her alone.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson accepted the job at Tulane, he told April he felt sick at the thought of leaving her behind. He postponed his move, however, when he heard about the plane crash. When [[Mark Sloan]] showed signs of recovery, April told Jackson the only reason she stayed was to make sure Mark was okay, and now that he was, she would be leaving for home.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen April was rehired by [[Owen Hunt]], she told Jackson she was in the process of revirginizing. Although Jackson didn't approve because he felt she was trying to pretend they never happened, he promised to help in any way that he could. However, they couldn't resist each other and continued their relationship until finally breaking it off. The two went their separate ways, which culminated in them seeing other people.\n\nDuring a massive storm near the hospital, a bus flipped and the doctors had to rush in and evacuate as many people as possible. The doctors believed they got to everyone, but Jackson stayed behind because he noticed a small pink shoe. When April noticed Jackson wasn't with them, she began to panic and rushed back towards the bus as it lay there ablaze. Suddenly, the bus exploded. Thinking Jackson was in the explosion, April became hysterical. When he emerged from the fire with a small child, she ran to hug him but was stopped by Matthew.[[File:Jacksons_alive.png|thumb|April Kepner realizes Jackson is alive.]]\n\nWhen Jackson was being treated by [[Callie Torres|Callie]] for his injuries, April walked in furious, screaming at him for almost dying, but was quickly removed. Thinking she had lost Jackson made her realize her true feelings for him. When everyone calmed down, she went back in to see him. She told him that she wanted him, which Jackson quickly rebuffed by telling her she was marrying [[Matthew Taylor|Matthew]]\uasoon. April then told Jackson to give her a reason not to.\n\nAlthough Jackson may have still had feelings for April, he did not give her a reason to leave Matthew. Instead, he exploded at April, telling her the only reason she wanted him was because he had moved on. This put a small strain on their friendship, but they still spoke occasionally. April even admitted that Jackson set her straight and she was happy to be getting married to Matthew.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the time came for April to send out wedding invitations, she purposely left out Jackson's name. She said she did this because she feared it would upset Matthew. Instead, she invited Stephanie, hoping she would bring Jackson as her guest. After speaking with Matthew and April, Jackson realizes that April truly wants him to be at her wedding so he decides to go and they share a brief hug, re-establishing their friendship.\n\nDuring the ceremony, however, Jackson apologized to\ua[[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]]\uabefore telling April that he loves her and that he always has loved her in front of the entire crowd.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref> It is later revealed that April chose Jackson and decided to marry him.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\nAfter working on [[Jill Kasliner]], Jackson and April fought about how they would raise their children. April walked out and ended up staying with [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] for a few days. She came back to retrieve her iPod and told Jackson that they couldn't table the discussion about how they'll raise their children any longer because she's pregnant.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref> They later discover that their unborn son has Osteogenesis Imperfecta type  and decide to induce labor at  weeks. Shortly after giving birth and holding their son, Samuel Norbert, he died in their arms.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Samuel, April left Jackson to go overseas with Owen to join the Army as a trauma surgeon. She was originally supposed to be gone for only three months but ended up staying away for a whole year.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nApril came back and things between them were rocky because Jackson felt like he had been abandoned by April during the time he needed her most. When April decided to take another tour, Jackson said that if she did, he wouldn't wait for her, although he said he loves her.\n\nApril came back from her second tour and Jackson told her to move out of their apartment. She refused because they were married and she didn't want to give that up. He eventually left and stayed with Bailey and Ben for a while. He told April he wanted a divorce and after some sexual encounters and four weeks of marriage counseling, April was served with divorce papers in the middle of the emergency room.<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref>\n\nRight before reluctantly signing the divorce papers, April discovered she was pregnant for a second time, yet chose to not inform Jackson and proceeded with signing the papers. Even after the divorce, she continued to keep her pregnancy a secret from Jackson and everyone else (with the exception of Arizona and Alex) until Arizona took the liberty in telling Jackson herself.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref> Jackson was very upset with April for lying to him and having to hear the news from someone else, but he was particularly bothered by the fact that April knew even before they signed the divorce papers, allowing their divorce to be finalized while she was withholding this important information. April confessed that she decided not to tell him because she knew he would change his mind about the divorce and she didn't want him to stay with her just for the baby.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nLater, she hooked up with Jackson while they were in Montana to work on a case.<ref>[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]], x</ref>\n\n[[Stephanie Edwards]]\nJackson started a relationship with the new intern, Stephanie, after hooking up in a car during Bailey's wedding, but he claimed it was purely sexual and only for fun. However, Stephanie seemed to think their relationship was more serious than that, stating that she would follow him if he were to find a job at a different hospital.\n\nJackson introduced Stephanie to his mother and the couple became more serious than they were.\n\nStephanie confronted Jackson about any residual feelings between him and April, which he denied.\n\nJackson indirectly broke up with Stephanie at April's wedding, telling her\ua\"I'm sorry,\" before standing up, interrupting April's wedding, and professing his love for her.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n[[Priya]]\nJackson briefly dated a woman called Priya, a human rights lawyer who travels a lot. When Jackson was invited to Maggie's game night, he decided to bring Priya. They played and had fun, but the night was abruptly ended when Clive's wife showed up, shocking everyone. After Clive and his wife left, Jackson called the night and took Priya home. He decided then to end things with her because of his feelings for Maggie.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nMaggie and Jackson began developing romantic feelings for each other during her mom's treatment for breast cancer at Grey Sloan Memorial. The two developed a stronger friendship after her mom's passing. Her mom, Diane, left Jackson in possession of pictures she wanted Maggie to have. April pointed out during the fire at the hospital that Jackson had feelings for Maggie, and Maggie\uahad feelings for him too. Maggie later confronted Jackson, quickly calling such suggestions, \"silly.\" But soon after, Jackson and Maggie started growing closer to each other.\n\nShe then later declined\uahis offer for a drink, citing that his mom and her biological father, Richard,\uaare married and that it's complicated. However, after discovering that Maggie's boyfriend Clive was married,\uaJackson ended his time with [[Priya]], unable to deny his feelings for Maggie. Jackson returned to Meredith's house, confessing his attraction\uafor Maggie and the two shared their first kiss, beginning a romantic relationship.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and Maggie's relationship had been going strong, with them having conversations about Jackson's loss and pain and Maggie's difficulty in opening up to him.\uaMaggie comforted Jackson during his mom's cancer treatment, while he encouraged her to be more open in their relationship. After they dated for a while, Jackson asked Maggie to move in with him, and she agreed.\n\nWhile they were camping, Maggie got stung by something, causing her to freak out and injure herself. After a bit of arguing about being in the woods, Jackson tried to explain that he didn't want Maggie to change just to grow and that Maggie missed out on some aspects of life due to her being so young when she graduated everything. Maggie called Jackson privileged and said that Jackson's family is so rich that he couldn't possibly know what consequences were.t, After this fight Jackson broke things off, saying their relationship was broken beyond repair.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n[[Victoria Hughes]]\nVic met Jackson when she responded to a call and found him holding [[Jai Prishna]], who was dangling from a rope over a cliff. She helped him wench Jai up to safety. Later, when she was at the hospital to drop off another patient, he asked her to go get burgers, but she said maybe another time. Later, they had lunch together in the park and talked about Jai. She told him about Lucas dying and he told her about his recent breakup with Maggie. They both agreed that it wasn't a great time for either of them to start a new relationship. Despite this, they continued to see each other, though it remained mostly platonic.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To|Nothing Left To Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Catherine Fox]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jackson & his mother, Catherine.]]\nJackson perceives his mother as a lunatic, constantly butting in on his personal life, mostly romantic and professional life, which he was especially annoyed at during his residency.\n\nWhen Catherine came to Seattle Grace Mercy West to perform the country's first penile transplant, she grilled him on his romantic life and criticized his girlfriend.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith and Jackson's friendship started when she discovered that he was the grandson of Harper Avery and son of famed urologist Catherine Avery. Familiar with the pressure of successful surgeon parents, she defended him when others teased him about it, and when he struggled to embrace or hide his legacy. They found more common ground when Catherine and Richard started dating and got married as Richard became a father figure in Jackson's life like he had been for Meredith.\n\nTheir friendship includes regularly teasing one another, such as her being protective of her at-the-time boyfriend [[Andrew DeLuca]]. She confided in Jackson that she had a bad feeling about Andrew's research with her father, while she did her best to be supportive of him. When he started dating Maggie, Meredith warned him not to cheat on her.\n\n[[Atticus Lincoln]]\nJackson befriended Link after working a few cases together. They developed a special handshake between them.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nJackson and Jo developed a friendship mainly after she got married to Alex. During a particular surgery, Jo was venting about Alex's mother pushing her to start thinking about having kids. In her rant, she called kids monsters, which offended Jackson. Jo later apologized to him and asked if the cute things outweigh the terror kids and cause. Jackson admitted to her that kids could be monsters, but they also give you the feeling that everything's right. He told her kids can ruin lives but also give you a reason to live when life tries to ruin you.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jo started thinking about finding her parents, Jackson warned her it could go badly as his finding his own father only caused him more pain.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Sloan|Mark]] gives Jackson a pep talk before his [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical boards]].]]\nDuring Jackson's relationship with Lexie, he and [[Mark Sloan]] developed a mentor/student relationship, which continues to grow even after Lexie and Jackson split. Mark often referred to them as the \"Plastics Posse\" - much to Jackson's embarrassment. They later became inseparable and were often teased about their bromance by the other doctors. After Mark's tragic death, Jackson promised him that the \"Plastics Posse\" would live on.\n\n\nJackson was initially a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Mercy West Medical Center]], until the merger with [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]]. Upon his transfer to Seattle Grace, Jackson has rotated over the services of several surgical departments, such as [[neurosurgery]], [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]], and [[Plastic Surgery|plastics]]. Jackson took a shine to Plastics and that is now his specialty.\n\nJackson is one of four doctors to pass their [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]], and he is currently employed at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] following the death of [[Mark Sloan]]. When the hospital was reorganized as [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and instituted a new board, Jackson became the de facto board chairman as he is the board representative for the Harper Avery Foundation, the majority shareholder of the hospital.\n\nSometime in Jackson's [[Timeline#Grey's Anatomy Season |third-year]] as an attending, he was promoted to the department head of plastic surgery.\n\n\n*Jackson originally declared [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]] as his specialty during his [[Internship|intern year]].<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref>\n*Jackson loses his composure and gets nervous when on camera.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: Message of Hope]]</ref> A similar event happened during his high school graduation.\n*He has nightmares, especially after the shooting at Seattle Grace.\n*He had a lucky pencil before it was broken during his [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|medical board exams]].\n*Jackson played baseball in high school and football in college.\n*Jackson is pro-choice.\n*Jackson lost his virginity when he was  to Sarah Richardson and Penny Cairo at his junior prom at the same time.

This was later confirmed in dialogue.<ref>[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]], x</ref>\n**In the real world, this would be impossible in the timeframe provided because no such fellowships exist. After his [[General Surgery]] [[Board Certification]], Jackson would have to complete a [[Plastic Surgery]] Residency for six years, and then complete an [[Otolaryngology]] fellowship for five years.\n*Jackson was the [[Gunther]].\n*Jackson was\uaan atheist but he professed a possible belief in God while April was in critical condition after an accident.

Matthew and [[Paramedic Nicole Cummins|Nicole]] assisted April, Jackson, and other doctors to give the boy primary first aid care.\n\n[[File:MatthewAndApril.png|thumb|right|px|Matthew and April kissing for the first time.]]After having saved the hit and run victim, April left the hospital and she bumped into Matthew. He revealed that he had been waiting for her and that he made up a speech. However, he got too nervous when she stood in front of him, so he made up a whole new speech. He told her that he thought she was incredible, because she managed to save the boy, and fearless, because she knew she wasn't allowed to bring the kid to the hospital, but she did. He wasn't finished yet when April, totally charmed by Matthew and his shyness, bent over and kissed him. As they were sharing their first kiss, Jackson and Stephanie Edwards walked by. Jackson saw them, realizing that April had totally moved on from him. ''(\"[[The Face of Change]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:MatthewAndApril.png|thumb|left|px|Matthew asking April out on a real date.]]\n\nAfter getting to know each other better, April and Matthew shared several short dates in his ambulances, consisting of talking and kissing. At some point, Matthew revealed that he wanted more than the short dates. He shyly asked her out. However, April was charmed by his shyness and said yes.\n\nThe date ended up in his apartment. They were kissing on his couch when he interrupted their kiss, saying \"this is only going so far tonight\". He then revealed to April he was still a virgin, saving himself for marriage. April was relieved, as she was worried about how he'd react when she would tell him that she was saving herself for marriage too. She told him exactly the same thing and almost told him about her sexual encounters with Jackson. However, she didn't tell him to not scare him off and they continued kissing. ''(\"[[Hard Bargain]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Matthew's injuries.]]\n\nWhen her patient was brought from the ER to the OR, April noticed Matthew laying in an ER bed. She walked over to him, looking worried, and asked him what happened. His colleague [[Paramedic Nicole Cummins|Nicole]] answered instead and told April Matthew broke protocol and ran in the crash to shield the kid from the blast with his own body. April started to check out his wounds, but Matthew told her to go to her patient, as she was more important than him. When Jackson said he'd watch him, April told him not to go into shock or bleed out before she went to the ER.\n\nApril walked by Matthew's room some time later, but Jackson was busy with smearing burn ointment on the burns on Matthew's butt. April felt a bit uncomfortable and left.\n\nThe next day, April talked to Matthew about her patient, who died during surgery. April started talking about God tearing apart her patient and her husband, who were meant to be together, when Matthew assured her he wasn't going anywhere. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Matthew was staying in the hospital, he planned for his mother to pick him up from the hospital. That way, she would meet April for the first time. However, April decided to come clean about her virginity. He was mad at her, not for the fact that she wasn't a virgin anymore, but because she hadn't been honest about it. Soon after, they broke up. ''(\"[[She's Killing Me]]\")''\n\nSoon after, Matthew came to the ER to ask April for a second chance. He said he broke up with her because he was hurt and that he acted like an idiot. April gratefully forgave him and they got back together. ''(\"[[Sleeping Monster]]\")''\n\n\nSome days later, Matthew proposed to April in a very original way. He set up a flashmob for her, in which friends and colleagues danced together with him. Almost everybody at the hospital knew about it, except for April herself. Owen Hunt helped Matthew by actively keeping April from surgery (which she was very mad about), so she surely would be there when the flashmob started.\n\nAn ER nurse came to look for April, saying a patient was coming into the ER. April said to Jackson, with whom she was talking then, she'd probably get kicked off that case too. While April went outside, everyone else who was free at the time gathered to go outside as well. [[Paramedic Nicole Cummins|Paramedic Nicole]] informed April that the \"patient\" felt like his heart was going to burst. When the music started, the \"patient\" started making noises, making April think he was having a seizure. Suddenly, while April was asking why there was music playing, Nicole and the other paramedic started rotating the stretcher. The man then came off of it, and he and the paramedics started dancing. Suddenly, other people came out of and from behind other ambulances and Nicole put April on an office chair. While all the people started dancing, all the staff that gathered came outside. Matthew then came running down the stairs and danced along with the others. While two dancers lifted up April, Matthew got a rolling table with a rose on it, which he gave to April as soon as she sat down again. He then told her how he fell in love with her and Nicole gave him a ring. Matthew then proposed and April said yes. The dancers then threw rose petals while the spectators, including Jackson, applauded. ''(\"[[Readiness is All]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the super storm, Matthew came into the hospital to see how he could help. When he saw how April reacted to believing that Jackson had died, he became suspicious of their relationship and figured out that Jackson was the one April had had sex with. ''(\"[[Perfect Storm]]\")''\n\nApril later found Matthew and assured him she wanted to marry him, even proposing to him herself. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n\n\nThey attended pre-marital counseling together with [[Reverend Drew]], where they were tested for compatibility and found to be % compatible. However, Matthew worried there was one area where they weren't compatible. April thought it was their different income levels, but Matthew really meant that she'd had sex before and he hadn't. He suggested they just have sex to get it over with, but she said she didn't want to be the cause of him breaking his promise to God. They agreed to wait. ''(\"[[Two Against One]]\")''\n\n\nAfter meeting up in a coffee shop where April and Matthew were having brunch with her sisters, who were in town for the wedding, they left the caf\ue at the same time, just in time to see [[Leo Davis]] get dragged by a cab. They both immediately jumped into action. While Jackson was distracted trying to control the crowd, Matthew used a straw to perform an emergency tracheotomy. They both rode to the hospital with Leo, where Jackson critiqued his technique, saying he made the incision too low and wide and horizontally instead of vertically. Matthew defended the way he did it as Jackson took Leo for surgery.\n\nApril later confronted Jackson about the way he'd treated Matthew, which made her sisters think he was a nitwit. Jackson told her Matthew did a good job and he'd have done it the same way. When April told Matthew this, he went to Jackson for an apology, but Jackson said that he really did screw it up. Matthew said he was just trying to save Leo's life and tries to clear the air with Jackson, saying he hoped he'd see him at the wedding. ''(\"[[Man on the Moon]]\")''\n\n\nDuring Matthew and April's wedding ceremony, [[Reverend Drew]] spoke to the wedding guests, asking them if they would support the marriage of Matthew and April. Everyone said, \"I will\" except Jackson Avery, who was at the wedding with his girlfriend, [[Stephanie Edwards]]. Shortly after, Jackson stood up in the middle of the ceremony as if he was about to say something, but hesitantly sat back down after receiving many surprised looks from guests and the wedding party. The ceremony resumed, but Jackson stood up again and confessed that he was still in love with April. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")'' Jackson and April then ran from the barn where the ceremony was taking place, and went to his car where they then drove away. ''(\"[[Take It Back]]\")''\n\n\nMatthew came to the hospital when his wife, [[Karin Taylor|Karin]] went into labor with their child. After the baby was born, he stayed with her, but returned to Karin when she had pain after her delivery. She was taken into surgery, where they had to remove her uterus due to DIC and HELLP syndrome. She survived the surgery, but shortly afterward, she went into PEA and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nMatthew brought Ruby back to the hospital when she had trouble eating and was vomiting. Arizona examined her and suspected it had something to do with her heart, but before she could run more tests, Matthew admitted that he was uncomfortable with her as Ruby's doctor, so she handed Ruby off to Owen. Owen examined her, but April went to him with a suspicion that it wasn't her heart and was actually something intestinal instead. Ruby was diagnosed with pyloric stenosis, which was easily corrected with surgery. While Ruby was in surgery, Matthew went to the chapel, where April came and sat with him. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\nWhile driving with April, she warned him about a curve up ahead, but he hit it anyway and the car overturned. April was able to get out of the car and call . They took Matthew to the hospital, where he revealed that April was with him just as he was sedated. He had bleeding in his upper left quadrant, so he was taken for a splenectomy. The surgery went well and afterward, he was awake and taken to April's room, where they held hands from their respective hospital beds. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\") ''\n\n\nMatthew attended Alex and Jo's wedding with April. After the wedding ended up cancelled because of a series of catastrophes, Matthew proposed to April again and when the officiant finally arrived at the wedding site, they decided to get married immediately, with Sofia as their flower girl. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the [[COVID- Pandemic]], his sister in Philadelphia got sick, so he took Ruby there to take care of her. However, his relationship with April was extremely tense by that point, so he and Ruby stayed in Philadelphia even after she was well again. April said he was still so angry about Karin's death and April leaving him at the altar and it got to be too much for both of them, so they started working longer hours to avoid each other until he eventually left. ''(\"[[Look Up Child]]\")''\n\n\nMatthew is sensitive and shy. He also saved himself for marriage. According to April, he respects women and has good values.\n\n\n\n[[April Kepner]]\n[[File:MatthewAndApril.png|thumb|px|Matthew tries to ask April out.]]\n\nBringing a patient into the ER at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], Matthew worked together with April Kepner in the ER. ''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\")''\n\nAfter some time, they started having short ambulance dates, and Matthew than revealed that he wanted a real date. April happily said yes, although she was concerned about how he would react to her wanting to keep from having sex again until she was married. She asked Jackson for advice, and he told her to let him get to know her first, and then tell it. However, it turned out April had nothing to worry about. The date ended up in his apartment, they started kissing on the couch. Matthew then stopted kissing, and told her that he was saving himself for marriage. He was afraid April would run from him, but she was relieved and told him she was doing exactly the same. ''(\"[[Hard Bargain]]\")''\n\nWhen one of April's patients, [[Elyse Cruse|a woman]] who seemed destined to be with her husband, died, April started thinking about her own relationship - although the implication is that she was really talking about Jackson, with whom she had earlier almost shared a kiss. Matthew misconstrued this to mean she was worried he'd leave her, so he reassured her, saying he wasn't going anywhere, and confessing that he was in love with her. April, stunned, did not respond, instead taking his hand. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\nWhile he was hospitalized with burns, Matthew planned for April to meet his mother, who was coming to pick him up when he was released. However, before they could meet, April confessed that she'd lied about being a virgin and he ended things with her, because she had lied. ''(\"[[She's Killing Me]]\")''\n\nMatthew later came into the ER, asking April for another chance and saying that he reacted brashly. She forgave him and they got back together. ''(\"[[Sleeping Monster]]\")''\n\nWhen Matthew decided to propose, he planned an elaborate flashmob proposal with the help of other paramedics, nurses, and doctors. She accepted his proposal immediately. ''(\"[[Readiness is All]]\")''\n\nDuring the Super Storm, Matthew saw the way April reacted to thinking Jackson had died and figured out that Jackson was the person April had had sex with. ''(\"[[Perfect Storm]]\")''\n\nAfter the storm ended, Matthew asked April if she'd only accepted his proposal because he did it publicly. She later took him to the hospital chapel and then proposed to him privately, to assure him it's what she really wanted. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n\nThey attended pre-marital counseling together with [[Reverend Drew]], where they were tested for compatibility and found to be % compatible. However, Matthew worried there was one area where they weren't compatible. April thought it was their different income levels, but Matthew really meant that she'd had sex before and he hadn't. He suggested they just have sex to get it over with, but she said she didn't want to be the cause of him breaking his promise to God. They agreed to wait. ''(\"[[Two Against One]]\")''\n\nOn their wedding day, April and Matthew avoided seeing each other, despite him working and her being at the hospital.\n\nAt the wedding, the ceremony started as normal, but abruptly ended when Jackson stood up and confessed his love for April. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\nApril left with Jackson, leaving Matthew at the altar. ''(\"[[Take It Back]]\")''\n\nLater, after his wife died, he and April started seeing each other again and had fallen back in love. They said it was different before because they'd been through so much and they knew each other's pain. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n[[Karin Taylor]]\nAfter April left him, he met Karin. Because of what had happened to him, he would only be friends with her initially, but he eventually knew she was the one for him. They got married and remained married until her death on the day their first child was born. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nMatthew has a very close relationship with his mother. He wanted her to meet April, but April confessed him she wasn't a virgin anymore. This caused him to be mad at her, and his mother thereby never got to meet April. ''(\"[[She's Killing Me]]\")''\n\nHis first child was born the day his wife died. They named her Ruby. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\nHis mother watches Ruby while he works. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\nMatthew is a paramedic in [[Seattle]]. His partner was [[Paramedic Nicole Cummins|Nicole]].\n\nAfter April dumped him at the altar, Matthew quit his job out of humiliation. However, he was seen wearing his uniform again when he came to the hospital with his wife, so he likely returned to his job after he had processed what had happened.\n\n\n*Matthew saved his first time for marriage, just like April intended to do before she had sex with Jackson.\n*He is a fan of the Iowa Hawkeyes.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Walking on a Dream]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[The Face of Change]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Hard Bargain]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[She's Killing Me]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Sleeping Monster]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Readiness is All]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Perfect Storm]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[I Want You With Me]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Two Against One]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Man on the Moon]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Personal Jesus]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[Cold as Ice]]\nxMatthewTaylor.png|[[All of Me]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nPromo.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Matthew Taylor Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Matthew Taylor]]\n[[fr:Matthew Taylor]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taylor, Matthew}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Paramedics]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which caused her rapid heart rate. Due to the severity of her condition, she was rushed into surgery to repair it.

Her foster\uaparents brought her into the ER, her fourth visit in three months. They said they knew it looked like they were abusive, but they insisted they weren't and that her file went back long before they got her.\n\nAlex examined her and found a place on her arm where she'd been cut falling off her bike and saw staples closing the wound. He asked if her foster parents had done it, but she said she'd done it herself because she didn't want to go to the hospital again. She said they hadn't hurt her, that no one could hurt her, and offered to let him punch her in the stomach. Alex went to give her a shot to numb her so he could remove the staples, but she quickly removed them herself without being numbed, including one that she had to remove with her teeth. When Alex questioned if it hurt, she whispered to him that she had superpowers.\n\nAlex consulted with Bailey, who said he needed to do a cold pressure test to test her response to pain. He did so and they both put in their hands in ice water. After he'd reached his point of intolerance, he yanked out his hand and had to pull Megan's out in order to prevent hypothermia as she showed no signs of distress. She then told Alex she'd let a kid who didn't believe that she had superpowers hit her in the stomach  times, plus once with a baseball bat.\n\nAlex ordered a CT, which revealed massive internal injuries. Addison suspected that she had CIPA, making her insensitive to pain. It's usually diagnosed in infants, but because she'd been in foster care, no one had put it together.\n\nThey ran genetic testing to confirm her condition and planned surgery, but Megan overheard them talking and ran away before they could operate.

She served in the U.S. Army as a [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]] at the same time as her brother,\ua[[Teddy Altman]], and\ua[[Nathan Riggs]]. She was formerly engaged to Nathan and she is raising her son, [[Farouk Shami Hunt]].\n\n\n\nMegan is three years younger than her brother Owen and grew up in Seattle with her family. The siblings attended medical school together, where they met Nathan Riggs, with whom she became romantically involved.\n\nOne summer, Megan and Owen went on a family road trip in California but Megan left the map in a rest-stop bathroom. Their father was furious and he refused to pull over and ask for directions. After hours of arguing with Evelyn and the kids complaining, their father just pulled over at a beach and they played there for hours until the sun went down. She considers it one of the best experiences of her childhood. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n\nIn  on the day of Megan's disappearance, a nervous Megan mocked Owen's difficult relationship with Beth while she, Teddy, and Owen were waiting to leave their base to fly to Fallujah. Their Colonel would announce the stratification rankings there, which could help Megan make the promotion to flight surgeon that she had been after. Megan went to get Nathan, who had been on call the night before. As she dragged Nathan out of bed, she found a necklace. He told her she wasn't supposed to find that yet and said it wasn't exactly a ring as she had lost a ring in the sink before. As he began proposing, she eagerly said yes. The two then joined Owen and Teddy to board the chopper, where Megan shared the news and showed off her engagement necklace.\n\nAt the Mobile Medical Treatment Center in Fallujah, Megan overheard other soldiers naming her number one for the strat ranking. However, the Colonel named John Matthews number one. Megan's disappointment was cut short when they had to spring into action to save wounded soldiers that had been shot by two of their Iraqi allies. As she and Owen were triaging, Megan vented her disappointment and asked if Owen had told the Colonel that she was CGO of the year. He told her he had but said those decisions were always political. Megan then went to take care of an Iraqi woman that did not want to be touched by men. The MP pointed out the woman had tried to wrestle the gun out of one of the shooters' hands. Megan learned her name was Sana and convinced her to let her examine her. After she placed a chest tube, Owen asked Megan to scrub in with him so they could celebrate her engagement, which meant their mother would have to plan two weddings.\n\nDuring their surgery, Megan wasn't shy about telling Owen to ditch Beth. Owen then brought up he was going to miss working with her if she had gotten the flight surgeon job, which he mentioned was three times more dangerous than her current job. Upon hearing him say that, she strongly suspected he hadn't recommended her but he dodged the question, only stating it wasn't his decision. They disagreed over their approach so Owen pulled rank, but Megan defied him and did it her way, which he had deemed too risky. She forced him into helping her, which led to them saving their patient's arm. Upset at him tanking her chance at her dream job, she decided not to fly back with Owen to the Green Zone and stayed behind with Teddy.\n\nAs she was relaxing on the OR table, Nathan found her and asked for the necklace back. Megan thought he had found out that she had slept with someone on a drunk night, but he actually came to get it back because it wasn't his to give. She then realized he had proposed to her with another girl's necklace. She got mad at him, though he pointed out she had just given him reason to be mad, too. She inquired if he had been serious about proposing, which he was. As he asked her if she had been serious about accepting the proposal, a soldier interrupted their talk to inform Megan that Sana wasn't doing well. Megan repositioned her chest tube while talking about her brother controlling her life to keep Sana calm. Megan then made sure Sana would be flown out on the next chopper.\n\nNot wanting to stay with Nathan at the medical center, she boarded the chopper with Sana. As the chopper was taking off, Teddy found out that Sana was actually the second shooter and that the man whom they had believed to be the second shooter had actually been wrestling the gun from her hands, not the other way around. Teddy tried to stop the chopper from taking off but she was too late. As a distracted and pensive Megan was staring out the window, Sana managed to grab her gun and hijack the helicopter, which disappeared while flying through unprotected airspace. Megan then disappeared for ten years. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\nHer disappearance caused a rift between Owen and Nathan, both of whom told people their own version of the story of her disappearance.\n\nOriginally, Nathan told Meredith that he had been working in a field unit with Megan on that day. According to him, they needed to transport a patient, but the chopper only had room for one of them. Megan wanted to go, as the patient was hers, so after failing to talk her out of it, Nathan agreed to let her on board. The chopper, however, never made it. Nathan also pointed out that after Megan's disappearance, he would've continued to look for her, but Owen wanted to give up searching and made him stop.\n\nUpon hearing Nathan's story from Meredith, Owen laughed joylessly, claiming that Nathan never said anything to Megan about not getting on board and, in fact, wasn't even anywhere near the chopper on that day, but with another woman. According to him, Megan had called him earlier that day, telling him that Nathan had been repeatedly cheating on her and that she was getting on the chopper to get away from him. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\nNathan later admitted to Maggie that, although he had told mostly the truth, he did cheat on her and they did fight. He said that he didn't tell Meredith about the fighting and cheating because he believed some things were meant for just him and Megan, and that he didn't owe anyone that explanation. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\nOwen later admitted to Amelia that when he learned that Nathan had cheated on Megan, he had told her to get on the helicopter. It was the last thing he ever said to her. ''(\"[[Trigger Happy]]\")''\n\n\nTen years after she went missing, she was found in the basement of a house in a rebel-held neighborhood, where she'd been left after a raid. After a hospital stay in Germany, she was sent to Seattle. ''(\"[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]]\")''\n[[File:xMeganHunt.png|thumb|px|Megan arrives at Madigan.]]\nSince a fire made the helipad at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] unavailable the day of her arrival, Owen and Amelia drove to Madigan Army Medical Center to meet the helicopter she was in. They were warned that she might communicate in extremes or possibly not at all. When Nathan learned that she was alive, he also left to go to Madigan. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\n\nOnce she was at the hospital, Megan revealed that despite being held captive, she was treated well. They only threw her in the basement to protect her from a bombing and wasn't actually kept in there. The only complaint she had was that she had a massive abdominal wound from a bombing that hadn't closed, which left her with a frozen abdomen. She was desperate to get back to her son, Farouk, a Syrian refugee she'd been caring for since he was four, so she wanted to get her abdomen repaired as quickly as possible so she could return to Iraq to be with him. Meredith suggested an extreme surgery that would close her abdomen much sooner than the more conservative approach and Megan jumped at the more radical option. After using saline implants to stretch her skin, Meredith attempted surgery to close her repaired abdomen, but found that she didn't have enough skin to close. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\nMeredith was forced to come up with an alternative plan to close her abdomen. After considering her options, she decided to look for a donor to give Megan an abdominal wall transplant. She challenged the sub-interns to find her a suitable donor. After reviewing several candidates they proposed, she finally found a good donor. Megan agreed to the transplant and it went well. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\nA week after surgery, she had sensation in her new skin and was healing well. ''(\"[[Go Big or Go Home]]\")''\n\n\nTo her dismay, she developed an infection in her abdomen which required IV antibiotics. When she learned that Farouk was in the hospital, she tried to leave so she could go back to him, but Meredith stopped her and convinced her to stay, reminding her that she couldn't be there for Farouk if she died. Unbeknownst to her, Farouk was only in the hospital as a cover Nathan was using to get him a medical visa to come to the US. She was happy to be reunited with Farouk. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nAfter being released from the hospital, Megan decided to move to Los Angeles with Farouk and Nathan, because when she was in Iraq, she consoled herself with remembering a childhood trip to the beach and the only part of the trip she couldn't fake was the ocean, which made her determined to visit the ocean every day once she was rescued. She sent Farouk and Nathan ahead to get the [[Megan and Nathan's House|house]] ready and then took a road trip to join them. Owen unexpectedly joined her on the trip, which gave them time to hash out their old issues. Once she arrived in Los Angeles, she walked out onto the beach and into the water. Nathan and Farouk quickly joined her and they played in the water together happily. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n\n[[Caleb Hicks]] was a patient of Megan's in San Diego. He had lost a leg, penis, and scrotum in an IED explosion and also had a frozen abdomen like she had. She convinced him to go for the abdominal wall transplant by showing him her own result. He was then brought to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to have that transplant as well as a penis and scrotum. After being briefly cancelled, the surgery was rescheduled and went forward as planned. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\n\nMegan and Farouk came to Seattle for Teddy and Owen's wedding. The wedding was initially supposed to take place in a park, but before the priest could finish the ceremony, a couple on a tandem bicycle crashed into him, seriously injuring both him and the couple. After the priest died, Megan stepped in and performed the ceremony at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nAfter the wedding, Megan stayed in Seattle to help cover Meredith's cases while she was in Minnesota. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nMegan became concerned when Farouk started getting winded more than normal and had swollen ankles. She took him to the hospital so Cormac could examine him and was upset to learn that he had constrictive pericarditis. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nMegan sent Farouk into surgery, but shortly afterward, a gas main explosion shook the hospital. Megan ran to the OR, where she learned Farouk was already under anesthesia for the blast. Despite this, she sat down and held his hand, saying when he was triggered by loud noises, she would hold his hands and hum cartoon theme songs, something she'd done since they were in Iraq. Winston and Cormac encouraged her to do so in the OR. The surgery went well, but his heart swelled, so they were unable to close immediately. They injected epinephrine and Cormac sat with Megan while they waited for the swelling to go down. Once it had, they closed and Megan went out to the scrub room and cried. Teddy and Owen met her in Farouk's room, where they said they were family and she didn't have to do it alone. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nFarouk was still in the hospital on Thanksgiving. They played Monopoly with Teddy and Cormac to pass the time. Later in the day, Farouk went into v-fib and eventually had to be put on ECMO while also being put on the transplant list for a new heart. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nWhen Cormac came to check on Farouk one day, he asked Megan how she was and suggested she go take a break or a nap. Megan told Cormac that if Farouk died, she would die with him. She had survived so much in her life and had no desire to survive Farouk's death. When a heart became available in Tacoma for Farouk, Teddy, Owen, and Cormac went to retrieve it. While they were gone, Winston took Farouk to the OR so he would be ready when the donor heart arrived. Evelyn came to the hospital to sit with Megan while she waited. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhile Farouk was in surgery, Cormac came to her and told her he needed to hear her plan to live before he told her some news that he had. She said he could watch her call her therapist, so he told her that Owen had been in a car accident on the way to the hospital with the heart had been seriously injured and Farouk's heart was bruised in transit. He then watched as she made the call as promised. Soon afterward, Megan was relieved when Winston and Maggie told her that Farouk's heart was beating strongly. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nMegan continued to stay in the hospital with Farouk as he started recovering. When Teddy came to Megan with concerns about Owen and Cormac's behavior following the crash, including Cormac's abrupt resignation from the hospital, Megan told Teddy that Owen always believes he's doing the right thing. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\nOnce Owen came home to recover, he and Farouk competed at completing their recoveries. To aid in his recovery, Megan converted his and Teddy's dining room into a home gym. As soon as Farouk was recovered enough, he and Megan returned home. Before she and Farouk left, Megan told Owen and Teddy to take the time to work out whatever issue there was between them. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nMegan and Nathan were in a romantic relationship, and Megan apparently loved him dearly. However, according to Owen, Nathan had been cheating on her, prompting her to get on the chopper along with which she disappeared. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Nathan have a confrontation over Megan.]]\n\nDuring their time together, she and Nathan talked about having kids. ''(\"[[Both Sides Now]]\")''\n\nAfter she was rescued, Nathan proposed to Megan, but she turned him down because she believed he was still in love with Meredith. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\nHowever, she later accepted the proposal and they moved to Los Angeles together with Farouk. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\nMegan said that she and Nathan visit a couple's therapist weekly. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\nOn Owen and Teddy's wedding day, Megan revealed that she and Nathan had split up. She stated it was a \"pandemic casualty.\" ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nWhile she was missing, Owen did not talk about Megan to his friends and co-workers. After some of them found out about her existence, he\uarevealed that they were very close and she used to follow Owen and do everything he did. He described her as being smarter, funnier, and a better person than him.\n\nAfter returning to Seattle and meeting Amelia, Megan talked with Teddy and Evelyn and they all agreed that Owen and Amelia's marriage was not a good one. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\n[[Farouk Shami Hunt]]\nWhile she was being held captive in Iraq, she took custody of a child named Farouk, a Syrian refugee whose parents had died in combat. Because she hadn't legally adopted him, she wasn't able to bring him to the United States with her. She'd been taking care of him for six years at the time of her rescue.\n\n\nMegan graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]]. She later joined the US Army as a staff [[Surgery|surgeon]].\n\nShe currently works as a [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]] in Los Angeles, possibly with a focus on veterans. She holds privileges at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], which she obtained when participating on an abdominal wall and penis and scrotum transplant.

Jackson proceeded to get drunk and when April came to find Jackson, she learned who he was.\n\nJackson went back to the diner the next night and told Robert who he was. Robert invited him inside to talk and had him try a coffee he had blended himself, which Jackson agreed was good. He then asked Jackson if he was happy. Jackson said he was and Robert said he was as well. When he told Jackson he left because he couldn't handle Catherine's expectations, Jackson left in anger.\n\nThe next day, Jackson went to Robert to say goodbye and tell him Robert wasn't his father anymore. ''(\"[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]]\")''\n\n\nA few years later, Jackson returned to Montana to visit Robert again. As this was in the midst of the [[COVID- Pandemic]], Robert's diner was closed to patrons and instead he bagged up lunches for the community each day and his employee, Tate, delivered them. Since Jackson was there and wanted to talk, he enlisted Jackson's help, having him help put sandwiches together. Jackson also asked his father why he left as he'd realized it messed him up and made it hard for him to maintain good relationships. Robert admitted that he regretted leaving Jackson, but left because he didn't want to mess Jackson up, unaware that him leaving had that effect anyway. ''(\"[[Look Up Child]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe was married to [[Catherine Fox]]. They first met at an annual gala for the Foundation. She ignored him half the night just to spite him.\n\n\nHe had a son, Jackson, with Catherine. When they divorced, he tried and failed to get sole custody of Jackson. After that, he had no contact with Jackson. When Jackson found Robert after years of estrangement, Jackson told Robert that he was not his father anymore.\n\nAs\ua[[Go Big or Go Home|implied]]\uaby Harper Avery himself, Harper wasn't a big fan of his son divorcing Catherine and abandoning his son. They were likely not on speaking terms as Harper closely worked with Catherine and Jackson.\n\n\nHe completed medical training and practiced as a surgeon until the pressure got to him and he walked away from medicine and his family. He moved to Montana and bought a diner called Jefferson Grill.\n\n\n*He plays golf on the weekends.\n*A deleted scene from\ua[[Roar]]\uashows Jackson telling Bailey about his father being appointed Chief of a hospital by Catherine.

According to Catherine, this would be the first penis transplant conducted in the USA.\n\nRyan was taken into surgery later that day. Besides Meredith and Jackson, who were scrubbing in, Catherine invited Mark, who had initially challenged her on her approach, to assist. The surgery started off well. However, Meredith had to leave after Cristina came into the OR to inform her that the case Alex had to attend was Zola who had been hospitalized with a serious bowel obstruction. Catherine let April take Meredith's place. This proved a bad idea in that a nervous April became careless with the suction and destroyed Catherine\us newly harvested dorsal vein.

Mark allowed Jackson to carry out the procedure, making the transplant a success.\n\n\nRyan came across as a pleasant and easy going patient. He stated that he was a coward for not going seeking help earlier and allowing the cancer to get to a point where he had to lose his penis.

While she was being examined by April, Alex noticed that she was bleeding and diagnosed a prolapsed cord. He quickly pushed the umbilical cord back into her uterus. They took her into surgery to deliver her baby.\n\nThe baby was delivered successfully, but Elyse began to bleed extensively. While Elyse was still in surgery, Vince arrived at the hospital and was introduced to his daughter. He then went to talk to Elyse, who was stable, but unconscious.\n\nLater, while her burns were being tended, she began bleeding through her sutures and went into v-fib. They were unable to revive her and she was pronounced dead. Alex then had to break the news to her husband, who was with their daughter.\n\n\n\nHe was married to [[Elyse Cruse]] until her death. The two met in a political science class when they were paired up by their professor. They dated in college, but then Elyse's dad died, so she left school. They met again about three years before Elyse's death when they both moved from Wisconsin to Seattle and joined the same bowling team. They later got married and had one daughter together.\n\n\nVince's wife, Elyse, was in an accident when she was  weeks pregnant. Their daughter was delivered after going into distress, but she was doing well after delivery. Vince named her Rose, as that's the name Elyse liked for her.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cruse, Vince}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.
