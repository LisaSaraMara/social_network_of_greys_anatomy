Crisis One responded and Luis let them in the apartment, where Alysha had locked herself and her mother in the bedroom.

She is the daughter of [[Elena Herrera]] and the now deceased [[Pruitt Herrera]]. She is divorced from [[Robert Sullivan]] as she believes his actions led to her transfer and [[Maya Bishop|Maya Bishop's]] demotion.\n\n\n\nAndy was practically raised at the station. She learned to run a hose from her father at age seven.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nAt age , she lost her mother.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> On the day of her mother's funeral, she didn't speak. She went home with her father after the funeral. She sat in the hall as she listened to him ring the bell  times,  times at a time. This is to signify that a firefighter has come home for the last time.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref> She sat on her bed for a long time and wouldn't talk to [[Pruitt Herrera]], until [[Ryan Tanner]] came in they hugged and he helped her through it.<ref>[[Eulogy]], x (S)</ref> At the same, Pruitt cut off all communication with Elena's family, isolating Andy from them. Too wrapped up in her grief, she didn't notice and forgot about them.<ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen she was a senior in high school and dating Ryan, the couple thought that they would get married to one another. Andy became pregnant, but chose to have an abortion, because she knew that if she didn't, it would end her career before it started and she'd live a life full of resentment. She never told Ryan because she knew he would want to keep it and him wanting to keep it would make her want that.<ref>[[Searching for the Ghost]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nOn her first day at the fire academy, Andy met Maya. Andy tried to tell her they didn't have to be friends because they were the only two women. Maya said there's safety in numbers and they ended up sticking together. When Andy struggled with a hose drill, Maya coached her through it. On her graduation day, her father didn't come because he was bailing Ryan out of jail.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen two boys accidentally set a fire while home alone, Andy was on the team that put out the fire and rescued the boys. While transporting them to the hospital, Andy stuck her hand into an open wound on Zach's abdomen, which resulted in her holding his abdominal aorta in her hand. They very carefully unloaded him from the ambulance and wheeled them into the OR, where Andy had to help clamp off the blood flow so she could remove her hand. After being freed, she left the OR, but wanted to know the outcome of the case, so Ben took her to the gallery, where they watched the rest of the surgery, which Zach survived.\n\nAfter learning what Meredith was trying to do to continue her research, Andy took the phone from Taryn and spoke with the person on the line and convinced the owner of the patent to meet with Meredith to talk about allowing her use.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFrankel came to the station and explained to Jack and Andy the procedure for choosing a new captain, which would take months. She said they'd alternate as captain each shift until then. Andy went first. She had the team do air consumption drills with new partners. Frankel watched for a while and then said she could stop back in anytime.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed. Back on the ground, Frankel admonished both Jack and Andy for their choices, saying Andy should have listened to Jack's experience and Jack should have followed orders.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.\n\nLater, Andy overheard Frankel tell Jack she worried that Andy had been handed her promotion by her father. She went to her father, who reassured her that he made her lieutenant because she earned it.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy responded to a call for an Aid Car at a police stakeout, just in case anyone got hurt. They got bored as they waited in the ambulance, unable to leave. After the lost the video feed and heart gunshots, Andy, worried for Ryan, wanted to go in immediately, but Maya reminded her that they had to wait to be called. Not long after, they were called in and they learned that it was another officer, not Ryan, who had been shot and they took him to the hospital for an x-ray because the bullet had been caught by his vest.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy and Jack carpooled to The Incinerator, a test to determine one's suitability to be Captain. They arrived surprised to find so many candidates and only one open spot. They were put in a group with [[Charlotte Dearborn]] and [[Cole Edmonds]] to take the test. Cole went first and expected the women to watch while he and Jack did the rescue and talked down to them. Next was Charlotte, who was cavalier about safety, though she set a record time. During Jack's turn, they put out the fire, but after multiple sweeps, they didn't find the dummy, so Jack made the decision to leave without it. On the outside, he was informed that very few people mastered that variation of the test and there was no dummy in the first place. Finally, it was Andy's turn. She emphasized them working as a team. She had them hold on to each other due to low visibility. The building started to creak as they crawled along and eventually, the roof collapsed, separating them. Cole didn't respond to her calls, so they had to find him. He was unconscious. Charlotte then called for a mayday over Andy's objections. Frankel ordered everyone out, but Andy decided to stay in and find the dummy. Jack stayed with her and they retrieved the dummy. Once they were out, Frankel berated Andy for her decision to ignore the mayday call. Ripley interrupted and said he understood Andy's call, but they have rules for a reason. It's a Captain's job to remember that. In a real call, they'd all have come out in body bags. He understood, but didn't agree with, her call. On the way home, Jack said he needed to win it because he was still in it, but Andy refused to talk to him about it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the test, Andy was ranked last, but was determined not to give up.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy took an ambulance out to give hepatitis vaccines to unhoused people. They saw Mason, who declined a vaccine and Maya's help.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen her father stopped responding to treatment, Andy was surprised at home much her father had hidden from her about his treatment. She told him about her promising her mother she'd take care of him just before her death. After Pruitt crashed due an allergic reaction, he still insisted on continuing the treatment, but asked Bailey to keep Andy included on all his treatment from then on.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. With the fire in the house, the garage started to heat up. They searched for anything they could use to try to free themselves. They found a toolkit, which Karen used to pick the lock on the trunk of the car and retrieve a jack. They tried to use the jack to lift the garage door, but it wouldn't budge. As the temperature climbed, Ryan decided to hot wire the car and try to use it as a battering ram. Jack said it was a bad idea, but Ryan started it anyway. Andy was able to stop him before he moved the car. Jack had the idea to use the motor from the internal door to get access to the house. It didn't work and they started to wear out. When Pruitt arrived and gave Andy a pep talk, she used the last of her energy to think of a plan. She saw the water heater and decided they could use the pilot light to create an explosion. They siphoned gas from the car and rigged the water heater up to explode and propel itself through the garage door. It worked and once they were free, they were all cooled down and rehydrated.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was waiting for her final captain interview, a page came in about a skyscraper fire downtown, so Ripley said the interviews were being postponed until further notice. Jack then told her that if he didn't get captain, he was putting in for a transfer to another station.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the active fire, they worked with Charlotte, who made the decision to jump through the fire to try to get to a fire door. Then there was a crash and she didn't respond. Andy jumped after her and found her injured. She used an extinguisher sphere to put out the flames and let the rest of the group come help her free Charlotte. Andy took Charlotte down to triage and because the fire was contained, she sent Jack and Dean to the floor above to check it out. On that floor, they found a large amount of combustibles. A rapid evacuation was started. Andy dropped Charlotte at triage and then went back up to the top floor to tell them to get ready for evacuation. Then she went back downstairs and helped Ripley pack up and evacuate base camp. When Jack and Dean found a civilian as they closed fire doors, they called for an elevator evacuation. Ripley said no, but Andy took the elevator key and sent the elevator up. Jack sent Dean down with the civilian and continued his work. He talked to Andy through the elevator shaft. She tried to convince him to find a way out, but he said he wasn't willing to sacrifice the lives of anyone on the team to try to save himself. She asked him to stay on the radio, which he did until it cut out a few minutes later. Then there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy refused to leave the building without Jack. She asked Ripley to send more people up to help, but he refused and ordered her to evacuate. She ignored the order and began climbing the stairs to the floor where Jack was. On the way, she met Maya and Vic, who were on their way down. Andy said she wasn't leaving without Jack, so Maya decided to go with her to help while they sent Vic down to find more help. Andy and Maya got to the floor where Jack was and found the door jammed shut. Maya worried that that meant that it was so hot inside that it could kill them instantly. Despite this, she helped Andy open the door and they stepped inside. They immediately heard the beeping on Jack's PASS device, which they followed to find him. He was under a pile of rubble, which they moved to free him. The three of them then evacuated the building and Andy checked Jack out.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter an apartment fire, Andy and Dean brought [[Natalie Forrester]] to the hospital. She'd been evacuated from the building and then collapsed on the sidewalk. Andy offered to sit with her son, who was anxious, while they waited for his father to arrive. Andy and Dean then got checked out by Bailey, a new requirement by Sullivan. Dean then lingered because he had a crush on Maggie. At the end of the day, he asked her out, but she told him she had a boyfriend.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation. Andy talked to Zoe and said she should become a firefighter because she was the kind of person they needed on their team. She gave Zoe her number and Zoe later sent her a picture of her in the hospital, eating jello.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Andy was paired with Vic and Ryan was put in their group. Vic suggested that Ryan go first. Andy showed him how to do compressions and made him do them continuously even as he wore out, because his dummy hadn't beeped back to life. He eventually stopped over her objections. Also at the training, Andy stood up for Maya when she saw Maya being singled out for criticism by Sullivan.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy was on the Aid Car with Maya. Their first call involved a kid. It should have been a simple call, but the kid ran into a building with a gas leak, so they had to track down the kid and break through a wall. They came back to the station very dirty. After a shower, they tended to [[Greg Tanner]], who came in looking for Pruitt to patch him up after a fight. Andy tended to him instead and called Ryan, who didn't believe Greg when Greg told him he got in the middle of a fight defending a kid and his phone got broken. When she was finished treating Greg, they got called out again, to tend to an injured hiker. With difficulty, they found [[Clark]], who had fallen and had a branch puncturing his leg. After returning from a later call, she and Maya found Greg in an elevator, where he'd passed out. They suspected a cardiac bruise from the fight. They were able to restore sinus rhythm.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Sullivan and Andy went on the first call out. They went to the scene, where they found a car that had been hit by another car that then drove off. Unbeknownst to Andy, it was on the same stretch of road where Sullivan's wife had died. In the car, they found [[Shannon (Weather the Storm)|Shannon]], who said she was trying to escape the storm when she was hit. Her leg was broken, so they splinted it, but because of the high winds, they had difficulty wrapping her leg, so they moved her into the Aid Car. As they worked, Shannon asked if one of them could get her purse out of her car, as it had a necklace her grandmother gave her. Sullivan retrieved it for her. They were able to stabilize her leg, but the radios weren't working because of the storm, so they were unable to get advice from dispatch on where to take her and Sullivan wanted to wait for the all clear before leaving. However, when they noticed the wind was starting to move the Aid Car, they knew they needed to get out of there. They tried, but the Aid Car was blown off the edge of a cliff.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy and Sullivan woke up in the aid car. Shannon was also awake, but Sullivan was trapped under the collapsed dashboard. Andy got him freed and he planned to go for help, but he wasn't able to move or feel his legs. Andy got him on a backboard and tried to reassure him as she treated both him and Shannon. She then put out a small fire on the Aid Car to keep them safer. Andy stayed in the back with them and continued to monitor them. Shannon coded, but Andy was able to resuscitate. After she was in sinus rhythm again, Andy decided she needed to leave the Aid Car to set off the flares. Only one was still viable, so she took it and left the rig. She made the difficult climb up and set out the flare. While Andy was on her way back, Shannon coded again. Despite risk of paralysis, Sullivan unstrapped himself from the backboard and tried to reach the defibrillator. When he couldn't, he attempted a precordial thump. When Andy returned, she started compressions, but she was unable to resuscitate and Shannon died. Soon after, they were found and rescued by the team.\n\nFour months later, Andy was awarded a Medal of Valor for her actions. At the ceremony, she fled after receiving the medal. She avoided talking to Ryan about why. At the party celebrating her medal, she hooked up with Ryan.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy, Dean, and Maya responded to a call about a woman injured in the park. They arrived to see a confused woman on a park bench with a head wound. She couldn't remember anything about herself or how she was injured. While checking her for other injuries, Maya found a picture of a boy in her shoe. They finished checking her out and then dropped her off at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Later, they found her at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] when they were dropping off another patient. Andy went after her and got her to agree to come back to their rig. Maya and Dean went to investigate how she'd ended up there. Dean learned she was a fugitive and the cops wanted them to distract her to give them time to arrive. They learned she was [[Margaret Chen]]. Andy felt there was more going on, so she asked Margaret about it. She stole some money from her work to pay for her son's medical care. She was going to put it all back, but she got caught before she could. He was scheduled for his surgery that day and she wanted to see him before her surgery. They enlisted Ryan's help. They were able to sneak her into the hospital to see her son and then she was arrested and taken to court.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Kathleen Noonan|Kat]] came into the station to check it out, she met Andy and Vic. She was looking around at all the stations to see where she might fit in, but she didn't believe she'd be able to get a spot at . Andy decided to give her a proper tour. Andy and Vic then talked to Kat about her experience at the Academy and not feeling like she was improving. They suggested rice. They got two bowls of rice and had Kat grip and release it to improve her grip strength. They said Kat needed to find a way to distinguish herself. She revealed that the skyscraper fire had inspired her to apply to the academy, as she'd been working in the building. At the end of the day, Andy introduced Kat to Sullivan.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. While they worked on her, Andy took Ellie to the conference room to talk to her and keep her calm. As her mom was ready to be moved, she said she didn't want to go to the hospital with her because she felt she was always messing things up. Shortly afterward, she collapsed from low blood sugar. She was given glucose and quickly woke up, but still worried about her mom having another seizure and her not being able to help. Andy then sent Ellie to the hospital to be with her mom, while they dealt with the damage to the station caused by the crash and subsequent explosion.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen Ripley passed out on a sidewalk and was taken to the hospital, Sullivan, Ben, and Andy came to the hospital to check on his condition. Andy and Ben were surprised to learn that he'd been buying flowers for Vic when he passed out. After being banished from his room, they waited in the hospital waiting area. They were shocked when his lab results came back, showing his condition was much worse than previously believed and he had fled the hospital in search of Vic.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\n\nRyan surprised Andy by showing up on her doorstep one morning. As she questioned why he was suddenly back from San Diego, they heard someone down the hallway calling for help. They rushed to her neighbor's apartment and found her bleeding profusely from her wrists, having cut herself on a broken glass while doing the dishes. Andy and Ryan called Pruitt and his partner and applied pressure to the wound as they awaited his arrival. The two of them promised the woman they would watch her kids while Pruitt took her to the hospital. As they were babysitting, Ryan played cops and robbers with Milo. Andy talked about having a fall-out with her father over his slut-shaming her. Ryan then shared he had returned from San Diego because Jenna had cheated on him to hurt him after he had told her he was still in love with his ex. As it dawned on Andy that he was talking about her, Milo appeared with his mother's gun in his hands. She and Ryan tried to get Milo to hand over the gun, but he assumed they were still playing and he fired the gun, shooting Ryan. Andy rushed to apply pressure to the wound and called her father back. They tried to save him but he succumbed to his injuries.\n\nAfter his funeral, she insisted on working. Her grief manifested in a permanent angry mood. She snapped at a bridal shop owner who didn't want to leave her store despite a gas leak. Andy and her team worked to evacuate the street, as flammable gas was building up in the sewers underneath, but an explosion happened in the bridal shop. Andy and Jack found the owner still alive inside and managed to resuscitate her, but Andy couldn't feel joy over having saved the woman's life. Maya tried to help her but Andy needed a friend who would just let her be rather than try to help her. Maya said she could be that friend, but soon after, Andy found Maya coming out of a meeting with Sullivan and learned that she had been promoted to Captain of Station .\n\nAndy was furious and ignored Maya at home despite her attempts to please Andy. At work, Jack told Andy they all thought she would get the promotion. Andy sighed and rolled her eyes as Maya gave her first speech to the crew. She joined the crew for Maya's mandatory group work-out but skipped the second session Maya organized because of Dean's being late. She ran into Sullivan, who told her he had passed her over because you only get one shot at the Captain job and he had been afraid that her grief would cause her to screw it up. Maya approached Andy and pointed out they needed to work as a team. Defiantly, Andy said they still were a team and rallied the others to support her. As a fight was about to begin, Sullivan cut in and ordered the crew to accept his decision. Later, Andy told Maya she was furious with her because she accepted the job despite knowing that Andy had worked for and earned the job. The next day, Jack found her reminiscing over an old photo of the crew under Captain Herrera. He hated how Ryan's death had cost her the promotion. She said men deciding things for her to protect her was a recurring theme in her life. She also admitted she had stopped feeling anything except anger since Ryan's death. He understood her and took her the place where he briefly used to live as a kid, which was now an empty lot. As they sat down for breakfast there, they agreed to move in together as Andy couldn't bear to live with Maya anymore.\n\nMaya took the group on a mandatory camping trip to increase morale. While the group attempted to keep things light and fun, Maya had the entire trip scheduled out and was adamant about sticking to the schedule. Andy lashed out at her every chance she got. The next morning, the crew was woken up by screaming and found some other campers had been attacked by a bear. While the crew worked on saving them, Andy, Maya, Pruitt, and Jack went on a hunt to find the woman's nose, which had been ripped off. While doing so, they came across the bear and Andy gave the group instructions on how to scare it off. On the way home, Pruitt finally apologized for having slut-shamed her. She appreciated that and asked if there was something else he wanted to tell her. He denied that and brought up Ryan's death. She opened up about her grief, which caused her to feel angry at the whole world. At the bar, Jack told her he had been sleeping with fellow firefighter Rigo's wife, breaking the firefighter code. As he said he couldn't bring himself to stop, Andy said she wanted to feel something other than angry, so they came up with the idea of sleeping together to solve both their problems. As they were making out in the back room of the bar, they agreed it was helping to make them feel better.\n\nThe whole crew gathered at the station with civilians to sit out a massive blizzard. Andy kept her hostile attitude towards Maya, having found a companion in Jack. Andy and Maya sprung into action when JJ went into labor. As they were giving her some privacy, Maya told her she would continue to be her friend as she knew Andy would have the done the same thing had the tables been turned. She hoped Andy could see that once her grief over Ryan eased up a little. Andy snapped that two men decided behind closed doors that she wasn't fit for the job. She wasn't mad that Maya took the job, she was mad that Maya took the job without a word of acknowledgment, which would have told Andy that she wasn't a complete sociopath. She then pointed out Maya was running the firehouse into the ground and walked off. As they were delivering the baby, Maya confessed that she had fought for the job and hadn't just been given it because Andy wasn't fit for it. She told Andy that unlike her, she knew how to separate her personal and professional lives. She admitted she had been a crappy friend but she still cared for Andy. She compared herself to Pruitt, who had been hovering over Andy lately to make sure everything was all right for her. Andy then realized that Pruitt had been lying to her. He confessed he had testicular cancer and only had six months left to live as he was rejecting treatment. Andy broke down and fled to the bunk. Robert came in and held her as she cried.\n\nAs she came to terms with her father's diagnosis and impending death, Andy continued to sleep with Jack, whose secret had come out during the blizzard. She convinced him to return to work with her and own up to it. They were present for the presentation of Ben's PRT truck. Later, Robert checked in on and her. She blamed her breakdown on the birth and Pruitt's cancer, declining any further help. While out for a call involving an aircraft explosion, Pruitt came to help out with the injured citizens. Still mad at him for rejecting treatment, Andy asked Pruitt if he had told Pruitt about his diagnosis and if that was the reason behind her being passed over for Captain. Pruitt said they would talk later. Based on the debris, Andy pieced together that the exploded aircraft had been a rocket. She went to inform Rigo and Jack, who warned Rigo to stay away from a newly discovered gas tank leak. Given their feud, Rigo ignored him and as Jack pulled him back, he dropped his fire extinguisher, causing an explosion that left him eviscerated. Andy went to get Ben and then informed Maya of the situation, convincing her to finally call HazMat. Back at the station, Andy openly challenged Maya's decision to have Jack and Rigo work together. Maya stood by her decision, causing another fight between them. Maya announced to the crew that they needed to stop questioning her every move and either get in line or request a transfer. The crew kept their heads down. Later, Sullivan found Andy, who told him she knew that he had passed her over for Captain because of her father's diagnosis. His keeping that from her only made it worse for her. He blurted out that he was in love with her and had been for a long time, causing him to fail at everything. She coldly told him that she couldn't be mad at her father for their stunt with her promotion given his cancer, so she would take it out on him instead. She shut the door in his face.\n\n\nAndy and Jack slept together at the station and worked together closely given their mutual hate for Maya. Spending so much time with him, she came to notice that he had been falling apart ever since the Rigo incident. While responding to an accident involving multiple injured bikers, Jack refused to stop performing CPR on a biker until Andy pointed out to him that the man was a lost cause, saying this wasn't going to be the win that Jack apparently so desperately needed. Part of the crew took Emmett out for drinks at Joe's bar. Jack followed Andy to the toilets, assuming they were going to have sex, but she shut him down. She told him their sex had helped her, but now that she was feeling other things than anger again, she deemed having sex with him too messy. She left the bar and went to Robert's apartment. She told him she was done fighting and being angry. She wanted to be in a safe space, which for some reason was him. She asked him to kiss her, which would make everything okay for her for the first time in a long time. He did kiss her and took her inside.\n\n\nWhen the team was called in to a fire at a storage unit, they found a rock band playing in one of the units. One of their cigarettes caught on fire, and it spread through the vents. Eventually, there was no visibility in the building, and the entire Station  team was stuck. When Sullivan heard Andy had no exit and had only % air left, he ran into the fire to try and help her find the exit. They both became trapped. Pruitt was playing Texas Hold Em with some of his former fellow firefighters, and they tuned in to the radios at the fire. When Pruitt heard Andy was trapped, he rushed to the scene. Pruitt got Maya to get Ladder  to the roof of the building, and Pruitt made a vent on the roof and fell to his death. Pruitt was in his final months before this happened due to cancer, so Robert and Andy got married so Pruitt could be there. Andy took a few days off, and Warren gave her a pill to help her sleep, and it gave her crazy dreams. Robert stayed with her. Fire Chief Dixon said that Pruitt was a civilian when he died, so he couldn't get a line of duty funeral. Vic had everyone do a photoshoot for a calendar to raise money for the line of duty funeral, and they also held a spaghetti dinner fundraiser, which is where Robert announced that he and Andy were married. Before they could do the funeral for Pruitt, COVID- hit, so they did it virtually, and Andy gave the eulogy. \n\n\nWhen Andy got all of Pruitt's things after he died, she found some things that were questionable. She found birthday cards from her Tia Sandra that her dad never gave her. She asked Snuffy Souza, one of Pruitt's fellow firefighters whom she was close to, and he acted very odd in response to her questions. She repeatedly called Tia Sandra, who never picked up, so she left voicemails. Tia Sandra eventually did call back, but Andy was drunk at a party with the other firefighters of Station . The day after the party, it was the day of Robert's surgery for his chronic leg pain. From what Andy knew, she thought her mother killed herself because she experienced flashbacks to their last fun day together, and she expressed this to Meredith. When Robert woke up, Andy had driven to a motel, and found her Tia Sandra, and also found that her mother was alive. Her mother explained how she had bad mental health, so she just left, and how Pruitt had made up the story that she died. Andy also found out that when Pruitt went to New York to help with -, he begged her to come back to him and Andy, but she refused. \n<br />\n\nAndy is confident, badass, she plays by the rules, but will also bend them if the situation fits.\n\n\n\n[[Ryan Tanner]]\nRyan is Andy's oldest friend and her high school flame, an attraction that still lingers in their present interactions. After her father collapsed during a fire, Ryan was able to calm her down.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nLater, when she heard gun shots while they were on a stakeout, she worried that Ryan was the one shot and was extremely relieved when she learned he wasn't. Later that night, she knocked on his door, but fled before he answered.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the strip mall fire, Ryan came to Andy, pumped about what he'd done.

She told Vic that she had an abortion after seeing her career end before it began and that if she'd told Ryan, he'd want to keep the baby. Andy revealed that they weren't ready for a baby, so that was one factor that led to her decision. She never got the chance to tell him before he died. \n\n[[Jack Gibson]]\nJack and Andy secretly began sleeping together. When she found an engagement ring while they were having sex, she freaked out. Later, when Jack lost Pruitt while they were in a fire together, Andy got angry with him.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe two continuously bickered because of their different leadership styles, but\uathey began sleeping with each other again after a while to relieve the tension and postpone the conversation they knew they needed to have. He decided that sex was not enough for him, and that he wanted more, to build a home with someone. Andy said she didn't want more and that the team and the station were her home. As they were arguing over this, they failed to properly dress and Pruitt caught them when he came to fetch documents from the captain's office.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref> Under pressure from Pruitt, they told the team about their relationship.

''(\"[[Here It Comes Again]]\")''\n\nAnthony was working at her restaurant with his wife, Lenya, when it was set on fire. Firefighters came to the scene soon afterward and [[Theo Ruiz]] escorted Lenya and Anthony out with help from their daughter, Vic. Theo carried a crock pot out with them, as Lenya refused to leave without it. Once they were out, they were given oxygen, but were focused on how much they would lose and when they'd be able to get back inside.\n\nAfter the fire was out, Lenya and Anthony insisted on Vic taking them inside to start cleaning up and figuring out what they could save. She tried to tell them it wasn't safe, but they knew she could keep them safe. Once they were inside, Vic gave her helmet to her mother, but her mother put it down instead of putting it on as she started to pick up tables. While they cleaned, Vic confronted her parents about them not checking in on her amidst the protests and especially the death of Breonna Taylor.\n\nLater, Vic found an office in the restaurant which had two bulletin boards full of pictures and articles about her. Her mother told her they brought as much of Vic as they could to the restaurant as she rarely came by anymore. Lenya also shared the experience of raising a Black daughter and how much that scared her. She told Vic she wasn't around much when Vic was growing up in service of trying to give her a better life. Lenya then started breaking dishes not broken in the fire. She said it was Greek tradition to start the grief process. Vic, Anthony, Theo, and Travis all joined in. Once the dishes were broken, they started to clean up. ''(\"[[Say Her Name]]\")''\n\n\nSeveral weeks later, when the restaurant was restore to its former glory, Vic set it up as the location for Maya and Carina's wedding, for which Lenya and Anthony were grateful.

Because the windows of the house wouldn't shatter and the air conditioning for the garage wasn't working because of the fire, the garage quickly started heating up. After a few more failed ideas to free themselves, Andy had the idea to use the pilot light from the water heater to start a fire and induce an explosion that would break through the door. They siphoned gas out of the car as an accelerant. They started the fire and took cover. The blast was strong enough to break through the garage door and they were freed.

However, the baby was still completely sealed in the amniotic sac, so they debated whether they should wait for more help or rupture it and stabilize the baby outside the sac.

He is married to [[Miranda Bailey]]. Ben was previously a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and was initially an [[Attending|attending]] [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] prior to changing his career to surgery, and later to a firefighter.\n\n\n\nBen grew into an adrenalin-chasing teenager. One day, he went on a joyride with his friends Michael and Danny with the latter's father's car. While out driving, Michael asked Danny to let him ride for once. Danny was hesitant but Ben dared him to allow it, which lead to Danny giving in. While Michael was speeding, Danny stood up in the backseat to experience that feeling that the other two had described as amazing. Out of nowhere, a deer crossed the road right in front of them. The car swerved and slammed into a tree. Danny was thrown out and Ben and Michael found him unconscious with an open skull fracture. Michael drove him to the hospital while Ben tried to get him to wake up in the backseat. Danny ended up in a persistent vegetative state. Guilt-ridden, Ben sat by Danny's beside for days until Danny's mother told him that she hoped that this accident had made him start thinking about his actions and that he would never do anything to make his mother go through what she was going through now.<ref>[[Indoor Fireworks]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAs a result, Ben changed himself to get rid of his adrenalin-chasing habits and learned to like crosswords. He got into med school and ended up choosing anesthesiology so he would be able to wake people up, unlike Danny.\n\n\nBen initially was an attending anesthesiologist at [[Mercy West Medical Center]] and transferred to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital when the two hospitals merged. During a surgery performed by [[Meredith Grey]] and [[Miranda Bailey]], [[Leslie Wilson|the patient]] woke up on the table and Bailey yelled at Ben to put her back under. Bailey put all the blame on Ben and said that at Seattle Grace, they could always trust the \"gas man\" to keep the patients under while the surgeons did the real work. He set out to investigate and discovered she had a condition that caused her to metabolize the anesthetics more rapidly than normal, which is why she woke up. He found Bailey and asked for an apology, though he let that go when he noticed how rattled Bailey was about the patient refusing to let Bailey touch her again. Leslie had be operated on again as she had a rebleed so Meredith took over from Bailey. During the surgery, Ben knew how to properly keep her under. He brought up Bailey's speech about anesthesiologists being lazy and she told him that she yells at people when she gets scared, which was the closest he'd get to an apology.<ref>[[State of Love and Trust]], x</ref>\n\nBen became interested in Bailey and asked her out to dinner on Valentine's Day to make up for the fact that one of their surgeries was pushed because of a massive trauma. She told him she was too busy with surgery. Callie and Arizona got involved playing Cupid and they got Ben re-assigned to Bailey's new surgery. Arizona joined them in the OR and steered the conversation towards dating. She told Ben that Bailey had almost become a pediatric surgeon until she changed her mind, hinting that Bailey could be persuaded to change her mind about the date. After surgery, Ben congratulated Bailey on her saving the patient. She then told him she didn't want to talk to him because she liked him and his being around her made her go stupid. However, she did agree to go out to dinner with him the next day.<ref>[[Valentine's Day Massacre]], x</ref> The first date went well. A few days later, he found her preparing for a speech at lecture day. He complimented her and although she told him to go away, she enjoyed being flattered.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, he told her she was having dinner with him that night for their third date. She had a yoga class scheduled but he convinced her to let that go. Callie got into her head about the third date meaning sex, so while at his apartment, she started lecturing him about her not doing things on a timeline. He interrupted her lecture and said lecturing wouldn't work on him because he wasn't too scared to interrupt her like the people at work. He told her they would have a nice dinner with conversation and swore that he didn't expect sex, because he, too, found the third date early for that. She confessed she hadn't had sex with anyone other than her ex-husband. He didn't mind and appreciated that she, like him, didn't get into that too fast. She asked him what he thought was the right time. While he thought they would know when they were there, he suspected somewhere between date  and . She cautiously asked if he was afraid they'd end up just being friends. He was confident that wouldn't happen since none of them started this looking for friends. He then kissed her and they had a nice evening.<ref>[[Push]], x</ref>\n\nThey continued to date for months. While back at his apartment, she started lecturing him about what he couldn't do to her at the hospital in order to keep her personal and professional lives separated. He got undressed in front of her and told her she could either lecture him or let him take her to his bedroom. She chose the second option. The next day, Mark and Derek found out because of the two of them were humming the same song on the elevator. Bailey later caught Ben flirting with a nurse and spent the day being cold towards him. He found her at the end of the day and told her that he flirted with Liz so she would do him little favors, which made his job more fun. Also, he brought his lazy flirting for Liz so he could save the good flirting for Bailey. She told him she was going through a tough divorce and didn't have time for games. He assured her he was in it for real and they left the hospital holding hands.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the shooting at the hospital, Ben was out playing golf with his phone turned off, so he didn't find out about the shooting until after it was over. Bailey was heavily traumatized from her experience and packed up to go visit her mother with her son. Ben came by her house and found her getting into a cab. She ignored his question about when she'd be back and left. She returned after a month. He tried to talk to her after her work day and she told him that while he was a perfect man, she was too busy holding herself together with tape and glue to be with him now. Since he missed the shooting, he couldn't understand what she was going through and that made it too much for her to be with him. He understood and told her to take care of herself.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\n\nFor the rest of the year, Ben stayed out of Bailey's way by bringing a guy named Pierre coffees so he wouldn't assign Ben to Bailey's surgeries.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\nAt one point, [[Eli Lloyd|nurse Eli]] and Ben got into a conflict because Eli yelled at one of Ben's residents for messing up a routine epidural. Derek broke up the fight and told Ben that they should fight over Bailey on his own time but Ben didn't even know Bailey was dating Eli. In surgery, Ben told Derek the news had upset him so much that he couldn't concentrate during a meeting. Derek then invited him to take out his anger by helping him build the deck at his house. While doing that, Ben vented his anger to Owen about Bailey blowing him off over not being ready for a relationship only to start dating Eli months later. The next day, Ben saw Eli and Bailey together with Tuck. He and Derek agreed they looked happy so Ben let them be. He came out to Derek's deck to blow off steam again in the evening.<ref>[[What is It About Men]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Ben decided he wouldn't avoid her anymore and they soon ended up on the same surgery again. He approached her and asked her if that would be a problem. She said no. He was happy to hear that because he was done paying off Pierre with lattes if she was now being held together by a male nurse rather than tape and glue. After the surgery, Ben couldn't fully hide his anger about her sleeping with Eli after she basically told him to wait for her. Bailey said a relationship like they had was too much for her to handle and added that what she was doing with Eli was nothing like what they had. Ben asked her what she was doing with Eli then but she ignored the question and told him to take it up with Pierre if he had a problem working with her. After work, Ben shortly greeted Bailey as he walked past her on his way to his car. She came after him and told him he would soon hear things about her breaking up with Eli. She wanted to clarify that that didn't have anything to do with him. He saw right through her lie and smiled as he said he'd see her tomorrow.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, Ben ended up in Bailey's OR again. He had heard about [[Henry Burton]] dying and brought that up, but she snapped that she'd rather talk about her living patients. Ben diagnosed malignant hyperthermia when Bailey's patient on the table started to deteriorate. He acted quickly to get the patient to cool down, which saved the kid's life. Bailey and Ben waited for the patient's temperature to decline sufficiently for the procedure to continue, during which Bailey complimented Ben's quick diagnosis. Afterward, they ended up in an empty cafeteria and she apologized for being rude to him when he mentioned Henry earlier. He was already used to her lashing out, which is what she does when bad things happen to her. It meant she needed space, which is why he sat down at a different table. She said she didn't just lose a patient, she lost a friend. He was sorry to hear that. She then told him she wouldn't mind if he didn't give her quite so much space, after which he moved to her table and held her hand while he finished his crossword puzzle.<ref>[[Suddenly]], x</ref>\n\nThey started their relationship again and after two weeks, Ben asked her to move in. She didn't give him an answer so he maneuvered himself onto her surgery so he could talk to her about it. Bailey recruited Meredith to flood her with questions so she could teach instead of talking to Ben about moving in. Ben saw through that trick and steered the conversation towards living together, citing Meredith and Derek as an example. Bailey pointed out that Meredith's tampering with Derek's trial nearly destroyed both her professional and personal life, which got her to admit that she wanted to keep her personal and professional lives separated. Ben commented he would just like for her to be the first thing he would see in the morning and then let it go. When Meredith left for lunch, Bailey told Ben that she didn't want to complicate what they had by rushing it. He told her his life was happening right now and that he wanted to share all of it with her, every day. If she didn't want that, he thought they weren't right for each other. She still didn't agree, which he took as his answer. After the break, Ben again pointed out Meredith had a perfect balance between her professional and personal life. The patient made it through and Ben joked they could go have a drink to celebrate if only she were to let joy into her life. She snapped and said she wanted to focus at work in order not to make mistakes. After the surgery, Bailey told Ben her whole life fell apart when she got divorced and she had worked hard to get back on her feet. She was scared of her relationship with him blowing up again, which would cause her to get knocked off her feet again. He said they could be scared together in the same house and take it one step at a time, starting with her bringing her toothbrush over. She reminded him she had a son. Ben liked him and assured her that he wanted the whole package. She then agreed to take it one step at a time.<ref>[[This Magic Moment]], x</ref>\n\nBen set up an elegant dinner for her them on Valentine's Day. That morning, he checked if they were still on for tonight as she had a habit of cancelling for a surgery. She told him she had rearranged her entire schedule to be out on time and even brought heels in the back of her car. However, she got drawn in when her patient was found to have a second tumor in a yet-to-be-discovered location. She had Ben push the reservation to  PM but by the time she made it out of the OR, it was :. She ran into Ben, not having realized the time until then, and apologized for ruining their Valentine's Day. She started a lecture about how he couldn't fault her for saving lives. She then noticed he was in a suit. He told her Valentine's Day wasn't over yet and took her to the cafeteria, where he had set up a romantic dinner for the two of them. He had been planning it for weeks as he knew they would never make their reservation. He told her he was very good at romance. She agreed and they shared a toast.<ref>[[All You Need is Love]], x</ref>\n\nAfter working on opposite schedules for weeks, Ben and Bailey agreed to watch a game together, though Ben hadn't planned on actually watching the game since Tuck was at his father's. However, Bailey had to cancel because Callie and Arizona asked her to come to girls' night to cheer up Teddy after Henry's death and her falling out with Owen. Bailey initially wanted to ditch the women for her evening with Ben but she showed up anyway.<ref>[[Support System]], x</ref>\n\n\nBen got offered an internship at UCLA. He accepted and moved to Los Angeles to start. At the beginning, Ben and Bailey weren't sure it would work out, but both Miranda and Ben kept their relationship alive only seeing each other every now and then.\n\n\nBen quit his job at UCLA because he felt he never saw Miranda or his stepson, so he came back and surprised her, saying he quit his job. Miranda was not so thrilled right away because she did approve of him giving up surgery, but, it was later revealed that he did not want to give up surgery and he became a surgical resident again at GSM.\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of whom had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Ben opened up a man in the psych ward and operated on a pregnant lady without proper consent and surgical equipment, he was put on probation for  months. He attained privileges as an attending anesthesiologist during his probation.\n\n\nBen was one of the many doctors who helped evacuate patients amidst the hospital explosion. When asked about [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie Edwards']] whereabouts, he recalled seeing her before the explosion and led a team of firefighters inside the actively burning hospital to find her. After searching, he found a trace of blood on the stairs leading up to the roof of the hospital, where they were able to locate and save Stephanie and [[Erin Miller|Erin]].\n\n\nBen claimed he was happy with surgery but wanted something more. Later he admited to Miranda that he had been accepted into the Seattle Fire Academy. Miranda was not amused but later supported Ben in his decision.\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. Having extinguished the fire, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean and Ben responded to an Aid call at The Langham. They found [[JJ Lau|JJ]] on her floor after she fell off a ladder. Her smoke alarm was still going off, so Dean broke through the ceiling and released smoke into the apartment. He picked up JJ and carried her out of her apartment.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop. They later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital. At the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she had developed a fear of fire since the tanker incident. The team decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. After the fire burned itself out, Ben was put on cleanup.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over. Afterward, Ben was interviewed by Ripley as part of the process to decide who would be captain of Station . He asked Ben about the situation with Peter and the party bus crash. At the end of Ben's explanation, Ripley applauded Ben's honesty in the situation.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. Outside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount. The trapped were freed when they used the water heater to cause an explosion and compromise the door just enough to give them access.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen came into work one day and learned that he'd reached an important milestone. He'd walked into and out of fifty fires. He was given a key to the aid car and permission to drive it. Station  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. Ben and Travis treated patients with minor burns at triage and sent them out. When Jack and Dean found combustibles on a floor above the fire, a rapid evacuation was started. In order to release the civilians from the top floor, Ripley sent Ben and Travis to clear the black smoke out of the stairwells so they could walk down. They did so, but when the fire jumped floors and broke out the window, Travis became impaled on a shard of glass. With the radios not working, Ben dragged Travis down the stairs. On the stairs, they ran into Molly, who had been trampled by a panicked mob. Her lung was collapsed. Travis told Ben to take Molly downstairs and save the life he could save. Then there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen dragged Molly down the stairs toward the bottom. She suddenly started struggling to breathe even more than before, so Ben put her down. He then used the needle from the EpiPen in her first aid kit to re-inflate her lung. He then started to carry her down the stairs to keep the needle stable. Once she was outside, he put her on a gurney and took her to the aid car and took her to the hospital. He handed her off to Bailey, who took her into surgery. Travis arrived with Vic and Dean moments later, but when he asked about Travis, Vic angrily brushed him off. They all went to the waiting room to see how Molly and Travis would come out. When [[Grant (Station )|Grant]] arrived, he was also upset to learn that Ben had left Travis alone. They continued to wait and were told that Travis's repair would be extremely difficult. Ben also learned that Molly didn't survive her surgery, which upset him. In the end, Travis pulled through and spent the next several weeks recovering.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away by the water. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis, Dean, and Ben responded to the call when [[Hannah Sherwood]] got her hand caught in her garbage disposal. She'd reached down there when her wedding ring had fallen in and got her hand caught. She turned it off quickly, but then decided to wait for help instead of trying to pull her hand out. Travis said he'd disconnect it and then take it apart to release her hand. While they were work, Hannah noticed that her daughter had gotten a tattoo and asked one of them to check it out to see if it was infected. Dean did and put antibiotic ointment on it. Travis was finally able to free Hannah's hand and they told her to follow up with the hospital in a few days.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor. At the party, Ben told Dean he was happy to be home with his wife, and prepared to make changes to keep her happy, which may include quitting firefighting.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter months of rehab, Sullivan was finally ready to go back to work. He met with Pruitt, who had acted as interim captain, and received reports from Pruitt. Pruitt criticized him for missing Jack's PTSD and not seeing that regular drop-ins weren't coming in anymore. This inspired Sullivan to take Ben and Jack for a wellness check on a drop-in Pruitt specifically mentioned. They went to his house and did an exam. He revealed that Sullivan was the reason he stopped checking in. His car was busted, leaving him unable to pick up his medications. Ben then heard regurgitation in his heart. He didn't want to go to the hospital, but he collapsed trying to fight them off. Sullivan distracted him with a game of chess as they worked to get him stable while they waited for an aid car. He stabilized, then checkmated Sullivan. After they sent him to the hospital, they remembered that he mentioned his car wasn't working, so they went to his garage and fixed it.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen, Dean, and Travis had planned to work together to repaint Travis's place. As they prepared to leave, Sullivan talked his way into an invitation to join them. With Sullivan there, they painted in virtual silence. When Sullivan started dancing while painting, they were disturbed, but he explained that when a month ago, you couldn't move your legs, you dance when a song comes on that makes you want to dance. The rest of them started to dance as well.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. While they worked on her, Andy took Ellie to the conference room to talk to her and keep her calm. As her mom was ready to be moved, she said she didn't want to go to the hospital with her because she felt she was always messing things up. Shortly afterward, she collapsed from low blood sugar. She was given glucose and quickly woke up, but still worried about her mom having another seizure and her not being able to help. Andy then sent Ellie to the hospital to be with her mom, while they dealt with the damage to the station caused by the crash and subsequent explosion.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen Ripley passed out on a sidewalk and was taken to the hospital, Sullivan, Ben, and Andy came to the hospital to check on his condition. Andy and Ben were surprised to learn that he'd been buying flowers for Vic when he passed out. After being banished from his room, they waited in the hospital waiting area. They were shocked when his lab results came back, showing his condition was much worse than previously believed and he had fled the hospital in search of Vic.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter reuniting with Bailey, he decided he wanted to try something that would be less stressful for her and thought it might be time to move on from being a firefighter.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref> When Pruitt heard about this, he suggested that Ben try out for Medic One, an elite paramedic team.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> Despite his medical training, Ben wasn't sure he'd be good enough to make it.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nBailey unexpectedly became pregnant, but then sadly lost the pregnancy.\n\n\nAfter months of quarantining mostly separately, Ben and Bailey finally got some alone time when [[Rosalind Warren|Roz]] took the boys out for a hike. They had sex and while cuddling afterward, Bailey felt a mass in Ben's testicle. She demanded they go see a urologist right away. Since he refused to go to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], she did some research and got them an appointment at [[Clark Kabir|Kabir Urology Clinic]]. Based on the labs and ultrasound, Dr. Kabir strongly suspected a mixed germ cell tumor, for which Ben's job put him at an increased risk. He proposed to perform an orchiectomy and analyze the tissue afterward rather than a biopsy, since that type of tumor could quickly metastasize. On the drive home, Ben revealed he wasn't sure what to tell the boys. Bailey was firm about telling them the truth, which would show them it is okay to be vulnerable. Ben confessed he wasn't ready to have the surgery yet, but Bailey reminded him of the mortality rate for Black men with cancer and said she couldn't handle any more loss after the year she had had. After his conversation with the boys, Joey joined him in the kitchen and asked him questions about the procedure. Ben picked up on his interest in medicine and said he and Bailey would help cover the cost if he were to decide to go to med school, much to Joey's delight.<ref>[[I Guess I'm Floating]], x (S)</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, news about George Floyd's death spread across the country. Ben found out on his phone at the station and joined his crew-mates in the lounge as they watched the news report on television in horror. Maya brought in [[Diane Lewis]] to grief counsel her team. Ben was the first to seek her out and opened up his fears as a Black man in America and the struggles of raising Black sons in the current political climate.\n\nBen along with Dean, Vic, and Robert attended the annual Black Firefighters Coalition where [[Battalion Chief Gregory]] gave a speech about working his way up to create lasting equity from within. Ben and Vic criticized him for being all talk and no actual change. Later, Ben witnessed how Dean jumped into the ocean after Gregory, who had fallen over the railing after clutching his chest. Ben grabbed a life vest and throw ring and jumped after Dean. Together, they tried to perform CPR on Gregory to no avail while the boat sailed off into the distance. Ben concluded there was nothing they could do for Gregory anymore. They realized they had drifted about a mile from where they had gone overboard, meaning they would be hard to find, and neither of them had a working phone on them to contact people on the boat. Dean refused to let go of Gregory's corpse and they floated around aimlessly waiting for help to arrive. As they drifted around, Ben urged Dean to fight so he could push through with his lawsuit and make the world a better place for Pru. He then revealed his cancer diagnosis and Dean found he was hesitant to have the surgery, which he called Ben out for. Dean freaked about dying again, which would mean that he would die without telling the one woman he wanted to be Pru's mother how he felt about her. Ben was shocked to find out he was in love with Vic. They held hands to float together like sea otters do. As the hypothermia set in, Dean asked Ben to raise Pru with Bailey if he were to die. Ben agreed to do so and reminded Dean that he was not alone in anything, that his village was also Dean's and that they would always support him and fight his fight alongside him. A boat then approached but it sailed past them without noticing them. The waves it created forced Dean to let go of Gregory's body, after which Ben helped Dean to stay afloat. Ben then envisioned Joey graduating from med school and thanking Ben, who couldn't be there but without whom he could never have done it. As they watched a plane fly over, Dean reminded Ben of their deal and said he couldn't use his legs anymore, which Ben attributed to the hypothermia. Dean was glad Ben had jumped into the water after him, even though it was stupid, so he didn't have to do this alone. He then said he needed to let go of Ben to give him a chance to survive. The two of them then finally passed out. Their bodies washed ashore, where the coast guard found them. Vic, Sullivan, and Bailey arrived at the scene just as the two men regained consciousness. As they were carried to the aid cars, they held hands.<ref>[[I Guess I'm Floating]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nHe initially clashed with Bailey when their patient woke up on the table while Bailey was operating, which she blamed him for. He later came to Bailey with medical proof and said that it wasn't his fault that the patient woke up. In the second surgery, Bailey said that when she is scared she yells, and that is why she was so mad at him. Ben thought of it as an apology and accepted it.\n\nThey dated for nine months, but after the shooting, Bailey broke up with him, saying she needed to put herself back together. They started dating again after [[Eli Lloyd]] broke things off with her because he was well aware she still loved her ex. They later got engaged and eventually were supposed to get married, but on the way to the wedding Adele Webber was rushed to the ER, and Miranda and Richard went to the hospital. Later they got married. They honeymooned in the Bahamas.\n\nDuring a day off, Miranda told Ben she needed to talk to him. She told him about how even with stepping down temporarily as Chief and changing her diet and exercise, her blood pressure was still too high. She asked him for a sabbatical from their marriage, saying she needed time to get her health in order. He left their home after giving her a last kiss.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter getting back in check with her mental health, Bailey went to Ben and told him that she realized it was her mental health that was the problem, not her physical and she wanted him to come home. He said that she had hurt him really bad, but eventually, he forgave her and showed her this by starting to build the treehouse he promised her after her heart attack. They agreed that they were in it together.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Rosalind Warren]]\nBen was very close to his brother growing up. They shared rooms for most of their lives, even into adulthood. The relationship was strained when Rosalind came out as transgender. Ben didn't really mind that his brother would soon be his sister and accepted her, but he hated the fact that she had kept it from him all those years while they shared basically everything else.\n\n\nDr. Ben Warren was a fifth-year [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] before he decided to be a firefighter at [[SFD Station ]].\n\nHe originally worked as an [[Attending|attending]] [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] at [[Mercy West Medical Center]] prior to the merger with [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. He kept his position as an attending anesthesiologist when he transferred to the merged [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. During his tenure at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Dr. Warren was the anesthesiologist on most of [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey's]] surgical cases and a few on [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd's]] cases. He also supervised [[Resident|anesthesiology residents]].\n\nAfter the events of the hospital shooting, Dr. Warren considered a [[Specialties|specialty]] change into [[Surgery|surgery]] and applied to [[UCLA Medical Center|UCLA's]] [[General Surgery|surgical program]]. At the end of the [[Timeline#Grey's Anatomy Season |- residency year]], Dr. Warren was accepted and soon after, relocated to Los Angeles and began his surgical career as an [[Internship|intern]]. Throughout his intern year, Dr. Warren commuted between Los Angeles and Seattle to spend time with his [[Miranda Bailey|wife]] and [[William George Bailey Jones|step-son]]. During his visits, he was granted privileges at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] by [[Chief of Surgery]] [[Owen Hunt]] and acted as a [[Attending|consulting]] anesthesiologist.\n\nDuring his second-year, Dr. Warren resigned UCLA's [[Resident|surgical residency program]] to move back to Seattle and be closer to his family. He then returned to his former position on the staff as an attending anesthesiologist at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. However, he missed surgery so much that he decided to continue his residency at Grey Sloan Memorial, taking [[Heather Brooks|Heather Brooks']] place in the program.\n\nHe took an interest in [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]] with [[Jackson Avery]] as his mentor, unwillingly forming the new Plastics Posse. However, when he was on Arizona's service due to Richard's switching around, she noticed his talent and requested him on her service.\n\nDuring his fourth year, Dr. Warren was suspended for six months from the surgical residency program by the chief of surgery. His suspension was due to performing unsupervised surgery beyond his scope of authority exacerbated by a perceived error in judgment leading to the death of two patients. He practiced his former specialty of anesthesiology while being suspended. His suspension was lifted by Bailey after he saved April and her daughter.\n\nNearing the end of his fourth year, Ben decided to apply for the Fire Training Academy and started working out every chance he could get. He was accepted and enrolled in the Medic One Program to become a qualified EMT, a requirement for Seattle firefighters. The Medic One Program allowed for his career change to be branded a fellowship in order not to completely disrupt his career as a surgeon, allowing him to return to the hospital at any moment if he sees fit. As part of the Program, Ben did ride-alongs with paramedics.\n\n\n*During [[What is It About Men]], [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] asks Ben about his time as a fifth-year [[Resident|resident]]. This is an error as the [[Resident|residency program]] for [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiology]] is only four years.\n*While a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at UCLA, Dr. Warren retained privileges as an [[Attending|attending]] [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] whenever he visited Seattle.\n*Ben appears to make it a point to try and stay out of his colleagues' personal lives.\n*He has a self-proclaimed impressive running whip stitch technique.\n*His family is \"all about Halloween.\"<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n*He snores and occasionally talks in his sleep.<ref>[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]], x</ref>\n*He had a crush on Thalia Hall in th grade.<ref>[[The Great Pretender]], x</ref>\n*He was the first prominent anesthesiologist in Grey's Anatomy.\n*When he was a surgical resident, the other residents made fun of him for being older than most residents.\n*Before [[Carina DeLuca|Carina]] joined the main cast of Station-, Ben was the only doctor to be the main cast.\n*He had a fear of fires.

During the dinner, Ifeya and Bill continuously tried to get Dean to join the family business. This came to a head when Yemi announced that she wanted to move out of their house, inspired by Dean. Ifeya then took Dean outside to talk to him privately, where he explained that being a firefighter is more than a job to him. He and Ifeya then made a deal that she would back off Yemi and let her move out and support her if he would go on a few dates that she set up for him. ''(\"[[Baby Boom]]\")''\n\n\nWhen JJ's parents came to town to meet Dean and Pru, they arranged to have a dinner with Ifeya and Bill. Despite a small amount of tension, with Ifeya expressing that she didn't want Pru influenced by JJ's lifestyle, the dinner went well and JJ's parents expressed desire to continue visiting her and having a relationship with her. ''(\"[[I Guess I'm Floating]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Dean's death, Bill and his wife struggled with their grief. On Thanksgiving, Bill came to the station and told Bailey that his wife needed her granddaughter. He agreed to stay and have dinner with them, but insisted he would be taking his granddaughter with him when he left. At the end of the meal, Bill left with Pru, whom he called Arike, which he said was her true name. ''(\"[[Little Girl Blue]]\")''\n\nDespite Dean's will stipulating that he wanted Pru to be raised by Ben and Bailey in the event of his death, Ifeya and Bill insisted that they would be raising her instead. They also cleared out Dean's houseboat and arranged for it to be sold. When Ben and Bailey tried to reach a good solution for everyone, Ifeya refused and said she needed to override her son because she didn't believe he'd made the right decision for Pru. However, when Pru woke up that night crying for Bailey, she called Bailey and let her, along with Ben and Joey, help put Pru back to bed. ''(\"[[A House Is Not a Home]]\")''\n\nAfter months of fighting, Ifeya and Bill came to Ben and Bailey's place and told them that they wanted Pru to live with Ben and Bailey permanently, but wanted virtually all holidays and alternating birthdays. Bailey rejected the offer, saying that arrangement made them glorified nannies while Ifeya and Bill got to do all the fun things. She then implied that she was privy to some private medical information that could make the difference in court. Ifeya then told Bailey she'd had a heart attack and had had surgery to implant a pacemaker, which they were still adjusting. It made it difficult to keep up with a toddler. Ifeya and Bill then agreed to sharing the holidays, but Ifeya still asked Ben to quit firefighting, as she didn't want Pru to lose a second father to a fire.

At the party, Dallas decided to pour the liquid nitrogen into the pool, believing it would look cool. It did, but the kids started asphyxiating due to lack of oxygen. Dallas pulled them out of the pool and then called for help.

In addition to that, they rekindled their romance.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nCarina went to [[Kate Lachman]] to get access to the patient files, but due to a misunderstanding, Kate declined. When Arizona stepped in, she gave them access. The research showed a climbing rate of c-sections, starting when Kate started working at the hospital. She encouraged Arizona to tell Kate about it, which Arizona did, offending Kate.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nTheir research continued and Carina believed it was making Arizona more paranoid when she demanded every possible tool they need be nearby when [[Lanie]] was delivering her baby, despite a lack of complications. After the baby was born, Carina told Arizona that everything had gone well, but when another new mother suddenly hemorrhaged, Arizona used a cart she'd had Levi put together and then modified to suit her needs to rush to her aid. They were able to save her life and stop the bleeding quickly. Arizona told Carina she thought their research was done. The solution was the cart, which was stocked with everything they could possibly need.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the time came for Arizona and Carina to present their research for consideration, she was paged away for a laboring patient and wished Arizona luck. After hearing that Arizona had accidentally distributed and consumed weed cookies, Carina offered her a ride home.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith went to Arizona to try to get Andrew off her couch, where he'd spent a whole week, Arizona referred her to Carina, who had admitted to Arizona that she doesn't believe in coddling children and believed Arizona was coddling Sofia. Carina came over to Meredith's house and got Andrew up off the couch and back to work.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Carina was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. When Taryn got drunk and said she was going to confess her love to Meredith, Carina stopped her, saying love's too precious to waste it on someone who can't love you back. After the wedding planner ended up having an allergic reaction to shrimp and was sent to the hospital, the wedding party and guests then boarded a ferry, where Alex and Jo were married by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Barry Clemens]] came into the ER with something stuck in his rectum, Richard paged Carina for her help in determining what the object was. With her help, they got Barry to confess on his way to surgery that he had put his wife's \"hair stuff\" up there. After Barry died in surgery, Richard asked for her help explaining it to his wife.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\n\nCarina told Andrew she'd probably have to leave town and go back to Italy for a bit because there were problems with their papa.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nCarina came back to Seattle after several months. She came to Andrew's place and revealed that she'd brought their father back with her.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen her father pitched his research, which involved creating a gestational sac to allow premature babies to continue to live outside the uterus, Carina was reluctant to support it because of her father's untreated mental health issues. She went to Alex with her concerns, but Vincenzo's project was funded anyway.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nCarina continued to watch her father while he worked on his project. When one of the lambs died, she wanted him to stop his research, but he said she didn't know what she was talking about and dismissed her concerns. When he learned she was working on a patient who was going to lose her baby because she needed a hysterectomy and the fetus was not yet viable, he went around Carina and talked to the parents about using his gestational sac. The parents wanted to try it, but they were quickly told that it wasn't available for use yet. Instead, Carina delivered the baby and then Teddy removed her uterus. The baby was then wrapped in a blanket and given to her father, who held her while she died. Because of what he'd done, Alex decided to cut funding to Vincenzo's research, which upset him.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy started having pains, she saw Carina, who diagnosed cervical insufficiency and put her in Trendelenburg.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy went into labor, Carina came and attended her birth.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia approached Carina to ask her to be part of a threesome with her and Link. However, Carina assumed she was instead coming to her about her pregnancy, as she'd seen the changes in Amelia's body. Amelia said she wasn't pregnant, just gaining a little weight, then awkwardly tried to proposition Carina. Carina just waited while Amelia realized that she was, in fact, pregnant.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Bailey started bleeding while she was at work, she went to Carina, who did an ultrasound that showed she'd lost the pregnancy. She told Bailey she just had to wait. When Ben arrived, Carina left them alone together after telling Ben she was sorry. Later that day, she did an ultrasound on Amelia, who hadn't gotten one because she was worried that what happened with Christopher would happen again. Carina assured her that everything was fine, but told her she wasn't twenty weeks pregnant as she believed, but twenty-four, injecting doubt as to the paternity.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\n\nCarina became increasingly concerned when she noticed that Andrew seemed to be struggling particularly hard with [[Suzanne Britland]]. She went to Meredith with her concerns, saying Andrew was the same age as as their father when he started showing symptoms of bipolar disorder. She also pointed out past events that showed similar alternating mania and depression, which led to Meredith going to Bailey and getting Andrew taken off the case.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after that, Carina became even more concerned when Andrew decided to walk to Seattle Pres during a blizzard to retrieve a liver for [[Elisa Tang]]. She called him every fifteen minutes while he was out. When he returned with severe frostbite, she tried to get him to understand that what he did wasn't normal or rational. He brushed off her concerns and said that his actions saved Elisa's life.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\n[[Maya Bishop]], captain of [[Station ]], came running into Grey Sloan after a bear attacked a civilian while the team was nearby on a camping trip. The civilian was rushed to the hospital with the help of the team, but was missing his nose. By the time they found it, the civilian had been taken to the hospital. When they arrived at the hospital with the nose, Maya brought it in side and unknowingly caught Carina's eye. They serendipitously met up at a bar later that night and Carina introduced herself. Maya let her initial offer of a drink down, telling Carina she was looking to drink alone, but when Carina asked if she was sure, Maya changed her mind.\n\nWhen [[JJ Lau|JJ]] went into labor at the station during the blizzard, Maya called Carina for advice on things they could do to make her more comfortable. Carina suggested putting her in the shower with warm water to ease some of her discomfort. Later, Carina suggested that JJ masturbate to ease her pain and speed up labor, which she did happily. Soon afterward, she gave birth.<ref>[[Ice Ice Baby]], x (S)</ref>\n\nCarina and Maya continued to hook up happily. When Carina heard from Ben that Maya had had a rough day, she brought lasagna to the station for Maya. Maya said they were just hooking up and she didn't need a girlfriend, so Carina put down the lasagna and went to leave, but Maya stopped her and apologized. She said she was broken. Carina said she's not in the habit of fixing broken people, but instead of leaving, she started kissing Maya, who said the lasagna smelled almost as good as Carina.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], x (S)</ref>\n\nCarina was present when Andrew started demanding that [[Opal]] be arrested for human trafficking. She cried and begged Andrew to stop and get help. When he finally left the circle they'd made, Carina followed him, though he brushed her off.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nAfter being told she could learn to rest and love in life, Maya invited Carina to take a few days off with her and go on vacation, which an invitation Carina accepted.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOn their vacation, Carina quickly noticed that Maya's head still seemed to be back in Seattle. She showed off her bikini and used it to entice Maya into bed. Then they finally left their room. While they were enjoying drinks by the side of the pool, [[Todd (No Days Off)|Todd]] came by and flirted with them. When he wouldn't back off, Maya challenged him to a push-up competition. She easily won the competition, winning herself and Carina a round of drinks on him and the ability to go back to their peaceful vacation. Later, back in their room, Maya received a notification on her phone of a -alarm fire back in Seattle. She immediately started to have a panic attack, so Carina talked to her and got her to breathe and calm down.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Amelia's water broke, she went to OB, where Carina examined her and determined that she was already at five centimeters. Amelia admitted she'd been having contractions since that morning, but ignored them because she thought they were Braxton Hicks again. Carina continued to monitor her as her labor progressed. When Link was needed for Richard's surgery, Carina said they still had hours left. He left and Amelia continued her labor and gave birth to a healthy baby.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nCarina was at the station making out with Maya when Maya's mother came in. Carina introduced herself and was mistaken for a firefighter and Maya's doctor before excusing herself away. Later, she returned to the station and helped Maya's mother, Katherine, set up for the spaghetti dinner they were having that night. Carina was shocked to hear of the abuse they were put through and tried to comfort Maya. Maya made it clear that she didn't see her father's actions as abuse and left. Carina later went to Maya's office, where she was crying at her desk. She shared her own experience with her father's mental state and said denial was a powerful drug. Maya said she wasn't in denial, that she was just angry, so Carina got up and left.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter that meeting, Carina checked in with Maya, asking how she was dealing with the new information. Maya continued to deny that her father was abusive because he'd never hit them. Carina shared her own experience with her father and said just because he never hit her or her bother doesn't meant they weren't abused. Maya didn't agree and when Carina wouldn't drop it, she said she needed to go for a run. Hours later, Maya returned and was surprised to find Carina still there. Carina said she thought about leaving, and giving Maya space, but she wanted to be there in case Maya wanted to talk. Maya told Carina to give her space and leave, also adding that she'd slept with Jack that evening.<ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nCarina was on the front lines of the COVID- pandemic as Grey Sloan was turned into the city's most prominent COVID treatment center. She and Maya moved in together at Maya's apartment so they could spend time together while complying with the quarantining rules. \n\nOne day, she ran into an agitated Andrew in the hospital parking lot as he pointed out [[Opal]], a woman suspected of child trafficking who previously managed to escape from the hospital due to Andrew's untreated bipolar disorder causing him to chaotically share his suspicions. Andrew was determined to not let her get away this time. He assured Carina that he was sure and that he had been taking meds and gotten enough rest. Carina believed him and agreed to follow Opal but insisted she drive. They rushed to her car and pursued Opal.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nThey tailed her and called the police, who found Andrew's story lacking evidence. They called Maya and Ben, who got involved and cut through the red tape to get police involved after all. After witnessing her making some kind of transaction in an alley, they followed her to a train station. Despite Carina's warnings, they followed her onto the train. As they reminisced about their childhood in Italy, Opal ended up spotting and recognizing Andrew. She got off at the next station. Andrew pursued her by himself. Opal managed to get away but was arrested outside the station. However, she had one of her companions stab Andrew as he pursued her. Carina found Andrew bleeding out on the floor and called for help. He was transported to Grey Sloan, where Teddy Altman and Owen Hunt fixed the damage to his diaphragm and ventricle. Carina awaited news on his status in the chapel with Maya and went to his see him in the ICU. However, later, he developed a cardiac tamponade. He was rushed back to the OR but he died on the table due to coagulopathy.\n\nCarina grieved his death at Maya's apartment. Maya helped her let it out by allowing her to scream covered by the engine's sirens. Carina was surprised when a friend of hers from med school, [[Gabriella Aurora]], dropped by the apartment to comfort her and reminisce about their years in med school and residency. When the President closed all immigration offices due to the pandemic, problems with Carina's visa could not be resolved. She did not mind as she had felt some sort of pull to go back to Italy to help out as it was one of the countries hit the hardest by the pandemic. She got her old job at the Paolo Calvino Hospital back and prepared to temporarily move back until the pandemic had settled and she could get the problems with her visa settled. Maya initially planned to move with her but her obligations as Captain in the midst of a growing war with the police department kept her from doing so, which Carina completely understood. \n\n\nShe is a feisty and confident woman. She is passionate about her family, especially Andrew and Maya, she loves them deeply.\n\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nSoon after arriving in [[Seattle]], she met [[Arizona Robbins]] at a bar. She ended up going home with Arizona and the two had sex.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nEven after Andrew came home and interrupted the events, they continued. The next day, when Arizona found out that Carina was at the hospital doing research, she went to see her and Carina continued her flirting.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nArizona described the sex the two of them had as pain-relieving.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Sofia was coming back home, Arizona inadvertently broke things off with Carina.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|px|thumb|Arizona and Carina kiss.]]\n\nAfter not seeing Arizona for a few days, Carina asked her if she was okay. Arizona said she'd taken a few days off after [[Karin Taylor|Karin Taylor's]] death. Arizona was shocked to learn Carina had never lost a mom, while Carina was shocked to learn Arizona had lost more than one. That inspired Arizona to look into it as a surgical project and once she had written up a proposal, she asked Carina to work on it with her, a decision they sealed with a kiss.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Carina made a comment about moving countries at the drop of a hat, Arizona asked her if she was just going to leave suddenly and end their relationship. Carina said that she had no plans to leave or end their relationship.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Arizona decided she needed to move herself and Sofia back to New York, she ended things with Carina.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nAfter things ended with Arizona, she met Owen at the new intern mixer. They flirted and then started kissing at the hospital.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nThings progressed from there to her making breakfast naked with him.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nAfter their tryst, things were awkward between them around the hospital.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\n[[Maya Bishop]]\nMaya caught Carina's eye when she ran into the ER with [[Scott Burke|Scott Burke's]] nose.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> Later that night, they met again at the bar and introduced themselves. Carina started flirting and offered to buy Maya a drink in exchange for the story of how she ended up running a nose into the hospital. Maya tried to turn her down, but Carina asked if she was sure and Maya gave in.<ref>[[Into the Woods]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey continued to hook up and Maya called Carina for help when JJ went into labor at the station.<ref>[[Ice Ice Baby]], x (S)</ref> When Carina heard about Maya having a bad day at work, she brought lasagna to cheer her up. Maya snapped at her, saying she didn't need a girlfriend and they were just hooking up, shocking Carina. Maya quickly apologized and accepted the lasagna.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter dealing with an accident in which a drunk driver took out  people on motorcycles, Maya called Carina to hook up. After they hooked up, Carina tried to excuse herself to go back to work, but Maya started crying, saying she was the truck that ran into station  and broke up a family. Carina held her and comforted her.<ref>[[Born to Run]], x (S)</ref> Maya then concluded that she wanted to step down to allow Andy to take her right place as Captain. The day she planned to tell Sullivan that, Carina told her to speak her truth.<ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey later went on vacation together, the first vacation Maya had taken in her adult life. While on the vacation, Maya had a panic attack, but Carina was able to calm her down.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTheir relationship hit a snag when Maya's mother came to visit and revealed that she'd been in therapy and was leaving Maya's father because he was abusive. Maya refused to accept that that was true, even when Carina shared her own experience with her father.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x (S)</ref> Carina continued to try to get Maya to accept that what her father had done to her was abuse, but Maya refused to accept it. Maya eventually left to go exercise at the station. While she was there, she ran into Jack. They fought and then had sex. When she returned home, Carina was still there waiting for her and she told Carina she'd slept with Jack. <ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref> They broke up as a result of Maya's actions. However, after Maya's father visited her at work and assaulted her at a fire, she realized Carina had been right. She found Carina at the hospital and apologized, saying she loved Carina and she'd never said that to anyone but her brother before, so it was a big deal. With encouragement from Teddy, Carina told Maya she loved her, too.<ref>[[Louder Than a Bomb]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen the pandemic hit Seattle, Maya and Carina didn't get to see much of each other aside from the occasional video call. They later decided they would move in together so they could spend more time with each other.<ref>[[Wild World]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nShe is Andrew's older sister. When he moved to the United States with their mother, she stayed behind in Italy with their father.\n\nWhen their mom went to Italy to visit Carina, she called Andrew to say their mom was sick and he needed to come immediately. When he arrived, he learned his mom had died before Carina even called, but she explained that she couldn't stand the thought of him knowing their mom was dead without her being there to hug him.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nShe cares very deeply about her brother, despite feeling he's an idiot. When she learned that his ex-girlfriend, [[Sam Bello|Sam]], was working at the hospital and he'd had sex with her, she reminded him of the time he spent three weeks on her couch because of Sam.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nWhen ICE came for Sam at the hospital, Andrew went to Carina and ask if she had called them. She denied it, saying she wouldn't do that to Sam or to Andrew.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nBecause of what happened with their mother, Andrew was worried when Carina said their papa was having problems. She assured Andrew that he wasn't dead.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nShe lost a grandmother and several uncles to COVID.<ref>[[Save Yourself]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nCarina is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where she is regarded as the best OB on staff.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref> She went to med school in Italy and finished residency at the Paolo Calvino Hospital. When she failed to get funding for her research into female orgasms and the pain-control aspect of it, she visited her brother at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] in order to ask its female Chief, [[Miranda Bailey]], for permission to use their MRI to carry out her project. Having secured funding by using drug companies' interest in developing a female viagra, she was finally able to get her study going.\n\nShe was granted privileges when the OB/GYN department became short-staffed and ended up becoming part of the staff. When her visa was expiring in the middle of the COVID- pandemic, she decided to temporarily return to Italy to help out in her home country. She got her job at the Paolo Calvino Hospital back but ended up being re-hired at Grey Sloan when she decided to only go to Italy for a month.\n\n\n*She is Italian and speaks fluent Italian.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n*She doesn't believe in coddling children.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n*She had her first job at age nine, sweeping the floor of a cafe.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n*She once stole a lipstick from a drug store.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n*She'd never lost a mother in childbirth until the Covid- pandemic.<ref>[[Wild World]], x (S)</ref>\n*She once pulled $, in cash out of a woman who wanted to hide it from her ex-husband.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxCarinaDeLuca.png\nxCarinaDeLuca.png\nSxCarinaDeLuca.png\nSxCarinaDeLuca.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Carina-centric or are otherwise very informative about her life.\n*[[Train in Vain]]\n*[[Learning to Fly]]\n*[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\n*[[Comfortably Numb]]\n*[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]\n\n\n:Marry me.

When part of the team was called out to free people trapped in a storage unit, they grabbed the radio and listened to see how well trained the team was. They discussed every call any of them made, as the call progressed from trapped civilians to a fire. When they heard over the radio that several firefighters became trapped in the storage facility and were running out of air, Pruitt abruptly got up and left. They continued to listen to the radio and heard that Pruitt was going up to ventilate the roof, knowing that once he did, he would fall into the fire. Lawrence told Irwin to prepare to sound the  bells. Irwin pointed out that Pruitt was retired, but Lawrence countered that dying ventilating a roof sure sounds like firefighting. Irwin sounded the bells.\n\n\nCharlie attended Pruitt's funeral, which was streamed online due to safety regulations concerning the coronavirus pandemic.

When she went for her practical test, she was grouped with Andy, Jack, and [[Cole Edmonds]] and each of them took a turn acting as captain as they went into a fire, put it out, and rescued a -pound dummy. Cole went first and immediately put the two women back to cover himself and Jack. He spoke derogatorily to both of them. When the time came to retrieve the dummy, he had himself and Jack go in, instead of sending one of the smaller women through a tighter area. Charlotte was not amused by his attitude.\n\nCharlotte's turn was next. Charlotte sent Andy past the fire, over Andy and Jack's protest that it was against policy. Charlotte then ran through some fire herself. Andy found the dummy, but ended up trapped behind the fire. The others arrived and put out the flames. Once they were out with the dummy, Charlotte was told she broke a record. When Andy called her out on her dangerous methods, Charlotte said Andy wouldn't get the best from her team by coddling them.\n\nDuring Jack's turn, they quickly extinguished the fire and then began the search for the dummy. They did two whole sweeps of the building, but didn't find the dummy, so Jack made the decision to leave without it. After exiting, he learned that there was no dummy and that was part of his test.\n\nAndy went last and due to additional smoke coverage, she had the team crawl, staying close together and constantly talking to keep track of each others. The ceiling started creaking as they crawled and gave way over Cole, knocking him out. They dug him out and called in a mayday. They were told to get out, but Andy sent the others out with Cole and decided to continue the search for the dummy herself.

Despite the hack, she was in such advanced labor that the hospital had to take her in. She wanted painkillers, but because of the hack, they didn't have access to any of that, so Carina suggested that Dayna initiate orgasm to relieve some of her pain. After that suggestion, Peggy refused to listen to her and when the power went out for a minute, Peggy decided to try to leave. However, Arizona examined her and determined the baby was already crowning, so Arizona coached her through pushing and her baby was born. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\n\nDayna had an inconclusive mammogram and was referred to [[Scott Hanson]] for a second opinion. He diagnosed her with stage II breast cancer and started her on chemotherapy. He also promised her she'd get through it. After her second round, she projectile vomited in the car, causing her wife to serve and hit a tree. She was taken to the ER, where they did a CT scan that didn't show any evidence of cancer, raising suspicion. After scheduling a fake appointment where she, too, was diagnosed with cancer, Arizona, along with Owen, decided they needed to stop Hanson. While Owen confronted him and called the police, Arizona showed Dayna and Peggy Dayna's real scans and told her she didn't actually have cancer, which they both celebrated. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\n\nTo express their gratitude, Peggy and Dayna gave Arizona some cookies. They later paged her because they realized they had used peanut butter with marijuana left over from Dayna's chemotherapy. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\n\nPeggy, Dayna, and Rose were out for a walk when Rose started fussing because she didn't want to be in the stroller, so Peggy took her out, but she refused to walk, so Dayna had to carry her. While they were walking, Dayna tripped when Peggy tried to blow Rose's nose, but couldn't break her fall because she was holding Rose, so Peggy reached out to cradle Rose's head so it wouldn't hit the ground, leading to Dayna injuring her face and Peggy her hand. They walked to station , where Carina recognized them, as she'd delivered their daughter. Thanks to the supplies that had arrived for the clinic, Carina and Ben were able to treat them at the station. Because of the location of their injuries, Ben suspected that Peggy had hit Dayna, but this was quickly put to rest when they independently gave the same story of what had happened. After they were treated, they had to fill out of a lot of paperwork, but they were grateful to avoid the ER. Before they left, Carina shared that she and Maya were looking at their options and asked if they'd used anonymous donor. They shared that they had and said there were pros and cons of using an anonymous versus a known donor. ''(\"[[Searching for the Ghost]]\")''\n\n\nPeggy and Dayna volunteered to help at the Dean Miller Memorial Clinic. They sat at the registration desk to check patients in. They recognized Jack as a former employee of the station, but decided not to pry about that. They gave him his paperwork. Next, they checked in [[Brooke]], who said it stung when she peed. Peggy said she had been there and slipped a pamphlet about STIs on top of Brooke's paperwork. They later led Brooke to a room and share their experience getting chlamydia in college until Carina interrupted them and politely sent them to sort inventory instead. When Brooke got her results, they eavesdropped and celebrated when her tests were negative. ''(\"[[Pick Up The Pieces]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Peggy Knox]].

Dean pulled him out of the water and started CPR while they waited for help to arrive. Pruitt responded to the call, but Dean refused to stop CPR until Tom was successfully resuscitated. Impressed by his persistence and skill, Pruitt gave Dean his business card and said to call if he was interested in a career change.<ref>[[Born to Run]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean took in Tiffany's dog, Charlie, because her new place wasn't big on pets. Charlie ate his alarm clock, which led to him being late for work and being put on desk duty for the day. He spent the day bored until [[JJ Lau|JJ]] came in with her broken fire alarm. He fixed the alarm and sent her home.\n\nAn Aid Car was called to Lakeside Estates to free Mr. Paige, whose testicles were stuck in his shower chair.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean and Ben responded to an Aid call at The Langham. They found [[JJ Lau|JJ]] on her floor after she fell off a ladder. Her smoke alarm was still going off, so Dean broke through the ceiling and released smoke into the apartment. He picked up JJ and carried her out of her apartment.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously.\n\nWhen they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAt the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she was scared of fire. They decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Maya noticed Vic just starting at the flames and stood with her when she said it helped.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station . He sided with Jack, saying Jack was always ahead of everyone else and the patients really love him, despite having argued with Jack during the calls. Ripley asked Dean directly who he agreed with during the call, which Dean struggled to answer. He said Jack would make a great captain, so Ripley asked again and Dean admitted that Andy made the right call in his mind, even after how things went.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter being out all night with JJ, Dean came into work extremely tired. The station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out.\n\nOutside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount.\n\nWhen Jack later asked Dean what happened with the access pad, Vic covered for him and he assured her there wouldn't be a next time.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the active fire, they worked with Charlotte, who made the decision to jump through the fire to try to get to a fire door. Then there was a crash and she didn't respond. Andy jumped after her and found her injured. She used an extinguisher sphere to put out the flames and let the rest of the group come help her free Charlotte. Andy took Charlotte down to triage and because the fire was contained, she sent Jack and Dean to the floor above to check it out. On that floor, they found a large amount of combustibles. A rapid evacuation was started. Andy dropped Charlotte at triage and then went back up to the top floor to tell them to get ready for evacuation. Then she went back downstairs and helped Ripley pack up and evacuate base camp. When Jack and Dean found a civilian as they closed fire doors, they called for an elevator evacuation. Ripley said no, but Andy took the elevator key and sent the elevator up. Jack sent Dean down with the civilian and continued his work. Dean was riding down with the civilian when there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean took the civilian out and handed him off. He then said he wanted to go back in after Jack, but Ripley forbade it and said no one was to go back in. Dean spent a while tending to patients outside before grabbing a tank and sneaking back into the building against Ripley's orders. On his way up to Jack, he ran into Ben, who was tending to Molly and sent Jack up to take care of Travis. Dean stopped where Vic was taking care of Travis. He wanted to continue up to Jack, but Vic told him that Andy and Maya were getting Jack and he needed to help her with Travis instead. They got Travis out of the building and into the ambulance. At the hospital, they waited for news. Despite it being a difficult repair, Travis survived his surgery and spent the next several weeks recovering.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter an apartment fire, Andy and Dean brought [[Natalie Forrester]] to the hospital. She'd been evacuated from the building and then collapsed on the sidewalk. Andy offered to sit with her son, who was anxious, while they waited for his father to arrive. Andy and Dean then got checked out by Bailey, a new requirement by Sullivan. Dean then lingered because he had a crush on Maggie. At the end of the day, he asked her out, but she told him she had a boyfriend.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Dean was paired with Travis and didn't want to talk about his birthday.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis, Dean, and Ben responded to the call when [[Hannah Sherwood]] got her hand caught in her garbage disposal. She'd reached down there when her wedding ring had fallen in and got her hand caught. She turned it off quickly, but then decided to wait for help instead of trying to pull her hand out. Travis said he'd disconnect it and then take it apart to release her hand. While they were work, Hannah noticed that her daughter had gotten a tattoo and asked one of them to check it out to see if it was infected. Dean did and put antibiotic ointment on it. Travis was finally able to free Hannah's hand and they told her to follow up with the hospital in a few days.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy, Dean, and Maya responded to a call about a woman injured in the park. They arrived to see a confused woman on a park bench with a head wound. She couldn't remember anything about herself or how she was injured. While checking her for other injuries, Maya found a picture of a boy in her shoe. They finished checking her out and then dropped her off at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Later, they found her at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] when they were dropping off another patient. Andy went after her and got her to agree to come back to their rig. Maya and Dean went to investigate how she'd ended up there. Dean learned she was a fugitive and the cops wanted them to distract her to give them time to arrive. They learned she was [[Margaret Chen]]. Andy felt there was more going on, so she asked Margaret about it. She stole some money from her work to pay for her son's medical care. She was going to put it all back, but she got caught before she could. He was scheduled for his surgery that day and she wanted to see him before her surgery. They enlisted Ryan's help. They were able to sneak her into the hospital to see her son and then she was arrested and taken to court.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen, Dean, and Travis had planned to work together to repaint Travis's place. As they prepared to leave, Sullivan talked his way into an invitation to join them. With Sullivan there, they painted in virtual silence. When Sullivan started dancing while painting, they were disturbed, but he explained that when a month ago, you couldn't move your legs, you dance when a song comes on that makes you want to dance. The rest of them started to dance as well.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStill upset with Dean for his part in the intervention, Jack called Dean's family and set up a dinner with them.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> However, before the dinner could happen, Dean's family cancelled and Jack was trying to reschedule.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFinally, Jack was able to reschedule the dinner. Ifeya, Bill, and Yemi Miller came over. Ifeya and Bill continued to try to pressure Dean to quit firefighting and join the family business. He said he wouldn't and after Yemi, inspired by Dean, told them she wanted to move out of their house, Ifeya insisted on speaking to Dean alone. He told her about how firefighting is more than just a job to him and got her to give Yemi the same support she gave him by agreeing to go on a few dates she set up. After the dinner, Dean proclaimed Jack an honorary Miller.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his Crisis One program turned out to be a success, Dean reached out to other fire departments in an attempt to expand the program to other cities across the country. The Chief of the Oakland FD was particularly enthusiastic and made him an impressive offer to move to Oakland to help set up the program there. Dean was seriously considering the offer and reached out to Diane to inform her that he would be taking a step back from the Crisis One program. When Diane in turn reached out to Vic to nudge her towards taking up a more active role within Crisis One, Vic pieced together that Dean was leaving. He admitted that she was right.\n\nTogether with his crew, Dean responded when an entire neighborhood was destroyed by an explosion. En route, Dean spontaneously invited Vic to move with him and Pru, whom he would love to show the world. Vic was baffled, pointing out how he had thrown her out in order not to confuse Pru, and after contemplating it for a moment, she told him she couldn't accept his offer. He had figured that she wouldn't but he had to ask. At the scene, Vic was electrocuted while up on the ladder spraying down water on a fire and ended up dangling while passed out. Dean rushed up the ladder and gave her mouth-to-mouth. She regained consciousness and they got her back down to the ground.. In the medical tent, Vic then told Dean that he was her brother and that she loved him. He reciprocated the sentiment, hinting at a deeper meaning for him, and then headed back to help his colleagues. He was close to a house when it blew up due to gas having built up inside it. Jack and Ben found him and tried to resuscitate him.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x (S)</ref> \n[[File:xDeanMiller.png|thumb|Dean is pronounced dead at Grey Sloan.]]\nThey got him to Grey Sloan as soon as possible, but Dean had been down for more than  minutes by the time they arrived. They were unable to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead.<ref>[[Bottle Up and Explode!]], x</ref>\n\n\nDean is charming and passionate. He's always looking for opportunities to be a hero. He's very much aware of the effect his firefighter uniform has on the ladies and he's not afraid to use it to get a date or two.\n\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany]]\nAfter responding to a fire at Tiffany's house and rescuing her dog, Charlie, Dean had sex with her.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> He also watched Charlie for her when her new place wasn't pet-friendly.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[JJ Lau]]\nWhen JJ came in to get her smoke detector fixed, she and Dean started flirting. He later responded to a call at her apartment building, which he discovered to be on fire.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref> Dean carried JJ out of the building and kept checking on her as he evacuated the other residents. When her sometimes boyfriend Seth died as a result of the fire, she came to Dean to talk about it.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean was worried about giving JJ enough time to grieve, so he went to Travis and then Pruitt for advice on how to approach JJ. Pruitt told him just to go after JJ if he wanted her. He said to go get a new incident report because hers was damaged. When Dean said it wasn't damaged, Pruitt poured juice on it and said it was.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref> He went to do the replacement report, but she saw what he was trying to do easily. She headed him off by asking him out on a date herself. He later showed up for the date, but because he'd had a weird day, he started rambling, which she interrupted with a kiss. He then carried her back into her apartment.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDean continued to enjoy his time with JJ, going to concerts and often staying out late. However, that started to affect his work when he was out all night before being on duty.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref> When Dean learned that JJ was pregnant with his child, she stayed at his apartment until she left him following the birth of their daughter as she felt overwhelmed about the responsibilities of being a mom.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nHe had a crush on Maggie. He asked her to dinner but she laughed and told him she had a boyfriend.\n\n[[Nicole|Nikki]]\nNikki went on a date with Dean that was set up by their parents. She was late to the date because of a client, but once she arrived, she suggested to Dean that they just get it over with. The conversation flowed easily, but Nikki left abruptly after thanking him for making the date painless. However, after working a shift, Dean decided to give Nikki a call as he really liked her.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ripley's funeral, the firefighters went to the bar to have drinks and celebrate his life. However, Dean realized that he'd accidentally scheduled his date with Nikki during that same time, so the others were surprised when she showed up.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter fighting the wildfire in California, Dean suggested that Jack and Maya come have brunch with him and Nikki. Nikki and Maya were both shocked to see each other as they had previously dated.<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref>\n[[Sasha Bennett]]\nSasha came into the station to get her earring removed from her hair and gave Dean her number.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x (S)</ref> She\uastarted seeing Dean after that.<ref name=\":\">[[Louder Than a Bomb]], x (S) </ref> Once the Covid- pandemic began, Sasha was willing to stay with Dean to take care of his daughter, Pru. Dean spent quite some time debating this, but eventually, they broke up.<ref>[[Wild World]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Victoria Hughes]]\nDean developed a crush on Victoria Hughes when she began helping him raise his daughter, Pru. There was even a suggestion that she move in and assist him.. [[Diane Lewis|Dr. Diane Lewis]] called the two out on their chemistry at one point, but they insisted they were not a romantic item. Dean harbored his crush until just before he died. One of his final acts before dying was to give an unconscious Vic mouth to mouth resuscitation after she was electrocuted while the team was on the scene of a fire, which helped save her life. The attraction between them had been hinted at multiple times before this incident. Prior to the incident that resulted in his death, Dean was considering moving to Oakland, California to expand his burgeoning Crisis One program, and asked Victoria to come with him and Pru, but she refused.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nHe struggled with his parents being too involved in his life. He solved this by moving out to his own place.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref> For his th birthday, his parents sent him a watch that was engraved to say \"Lost time is never found again.\" He knew it was meant to pressure him to quit fighting fires and join the family business.

[[Pat Aquino]] assigned Andy to show her the ropes. Andy showed her her locker and gave her some tips about the station. Andy was dismayed when Deja laughed at Maddox's sexist jokes and told her she didn't have to do that. Deja said that she wasn't a legacy like Andy and if she had to laugh at some sexist jokes to fit in, she could do that.\n\nThey were later called out to back up station  at a gas main explosion. Andy coached Deja on the way, reminding her to listen to command and remember what she'd learned. Maddox called her feisty. Andy tried to defend Deja, but Deja brushed it off, saying she could take a compliment.\n\nAfter [[Pat Aquino]] and [[Dean Miller]] were seriously injured, station  drove to the hospital. Deja asked if the shift was normal and Theo told her that it wasn't. They all cried together, despite Andy's insistence that Dean would live. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Deja was sent to the store to get groceries for Thanksgiving, despite them already having enough food. Andy explained that they were making extra food for the families of Aquino and Morse. ''(\"[[Little Girl Blue]]\")''\n\n\nAndy stepped in as acting captain while Aquino recovered. During this time, there was an increase in sexist comments, especially directed toward Deja, in the name of hazing. Andy encouraged Deja to speak up for herself and not let them speak to her like that, but Deja continued to insist it was fine. When they were called out to an apartment fire, Andy assigned Deja and Maddox to evacuate the building's residents. However, when they got inside, Maddox said all the action was in fire attack, so he left her to do evacuations on her own. When she told Andy what Maddox had done, Andy tried to call him back, but was repeatedly ignored. When they returned to the station, Andy called everyone's attention to her and said that the attitude around the station needed to change, that the hazing and the sexism and ignoring her orders needed to stop or there would be consequences. She then privately told Deja she was writing Maddox up for what he'd done and would leave Deja's name out of it. She realized that it was her job as captain to make the station a safe place for everyone working there. ''(\"[[A House Is Not a Home]]\")''\n\nOn the first day the new chief, [[Natasha Ross]], visited the station, station  was called out alongside station  to retrieve a car that had gone over Leon's Ridge. On the scene, Deja helped block traffic to prevent any additional accidents. When [[Owen Hunt]] was lifted out of the car, Deja helped get him safely back onto solid ground. ''(\"[[Started from the Bottom]]\")''\n\n\nDeja, along with the rest of stations  and , participated in the K N Turnouts fundraiser. After it was over, all the members of  went home to enjoy their day off. ''(\"[[Searching for the Ghost]]\")''\n\n\nDeja and the rest of station  responded to a call about a skydiver who had gotten caught in a tree. They arrived on the scene to find [[Sam]], who was impaled on a tree branch in multiple places. She regained consciousness shortly after they arrived. Andy sent Maddox and Theo up into the tree to start cutting her free while Deja cleared room for them to work. While they were working, Maddox dropped his saw, which made Sam start to panic. Wanting to keep her calm, Andy climbed up the ladder herself and helped get Sam free. Once the branches were cut, they put her on a stretcher, but she coded. Andy did CPR on the way to the hospital, but they were unable to resuscitate her. ''(\"[[In My Tree]]\")''\n\n\nAt the start of their shift, Ross came and told the team she was shutting  down. She told them they'd all be given reassignments or severances and they'd know which soon. Until it was shut down, she encouraged them to keep serving the city as they'd always done.\n\nDeja responded along with the rest of station  to a fire at Sweet Ana's Candy Factory. She was sent inside with Andy on backup fire attack. They went inside with a line, but struggled to move as the candy made the floor very sticky. They then worked to close the hopper to stop the flow of sugar, which would make extinguishing the fire much easier. While they were trying to do that, they heard [[Stella]] calling out for help. Deja helped her get to Theo, who evacuated her. Then she went back to Andy and they were able to use something nearby to get enough leverage to close the hopper. Shortly after that, the fire was put out.\n\nThe next morning, as the next shift arrived to relieve them, Deja complimented Andy's leadership and Andy gave a speech about them being part of the history of station . ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\nThe firefighters gathered at the station one last time, taking pictures, before the flag was lowered and the lights were turned off for the last time.

She worked there as a teen until she was raped in the backroom at the age of , after which she didn't want to go back there.\n\n\nDiane had a bad drop out of a helicopter, which left her with a shattered leg. Her team was then forced to rescue her, which cost them the ability to save a family's house and their dog, Aldo. While she waited to be rescued, she could hear Aldo barking and said that based on the way he was barking at the end, she knew it wasn't the smoke that got him. She heard the barking persistently after that, until someone came to her bedside and made her start talking and the barking started to get quieter. Since her leg never fully recovered, she learned how to counsel people who had been through a trauma like she had.\n\n\nDiane came to station  after the death of [[Rigo Vasquez]]. The team was disinterested in talking to her, but they were all forced to. She first spoke to Jack, who was struggling because he believed he'd caused Rigo's death. She asked Jack to think about why he continued to sleep with Eva after learning she was Rigo's wife. He talked about his childhood and a call from last Christmas, where he put out a woman's tree and realized that she didn't have any family or friend around. She had only the tree, which burned down. When Jack started crying, she encouraged him not to wipe away the tears, but to let them all out. He later asked her again why she thought he broke the code and she told him that trauma was the pattern he learned to live in. due to his childhood. She reminded him that his family at the station was still alive, and said he needs to name and heal the trauma or he'd end up reliving it. She then told him that that's not why Rigo died. Rigo died because he didn't follow orders. She also gave him her card in case he needed to reach out more.\n\nNext, she spoke to Andy, who was angry at Jack for breaking the code, Maya for putting him in the field with Rigo, and Sullivan for promoting Maya over her. She then talked about her history of dancing, particularly salsa, and then admitted that she was in love with Sullivan and felt electric when she was around him. Diane told her that love isn't electric. It's when it's combined with rule-breaking that it feels like that. When Diane asked if she and Rigo were friends, she said she barely knew Rigo.\n\nDiane went next to Travis, who asked to be allowed to continue making food for Eva while they talked. She allowed it even though it was a public space, but when he expressed frustration that Emmett was closeting himself to please his father, she told him he was allowed to discuss his private business in the public space, but not anyone else's. Travis then switched to code to express how Emmett did what his father wanted instead of what was best for himself, including becoming a firefighter in the first place. Diane pointed out how brave he was to be an openly gay firefighter himself how he might be the only one. When he told her a story about saving a woman while he was on a date and dressed as Dr. Frank N. Furter, she further applauded his bravery, though he brushed it off. She asked who gave him so much shame to carry that he had to pretend that his bravery was just other people being cowards. Travis started to cry and claimed it was about Rigo's death.\n\nShe next spoke to Ben and they talked about changing careers in the middle of their lives. She shared her experience being married to a firefighter to get him to understand his wife better. He expressed that he felt he was wicked, which is why God had Bailey have a miscarriage, because Bailey is righteous. Diane asked him about the angriest he'd ever been and he shared the story of being pulled over by a cop and forced to lie facedown on the ground. He admitted to plotting a few revenge fantasies, but then just reported the behavior to the Chief of Police and City Council, and also donated money to the ACLU. Diane told him he wasn't wicked, he was righteous.\n\nDiane then went to talk to Dean, but found him in the gym with Vic. He asked to talk in there, saying he could say anything in front of Vic. Diane allowed it because her gut told her he had something to say that he wanted Vic to hear and wouldn't say it if she weren't there. He talked about Pru and how his parents cut him off, both financially and emotionally. He was raised to have a lot of pride for being Nigerian, but now is failing to meet his parents' expectations in multiple ways. He then addressed Vic, saying he believed she sabotaged her relationship with Jackson because she felt guilty for moving on so fast after Ripley, and that she should make things right with him. Vic then told Diane that her best friend in high school was a -year-old man who lived in her grandmother's assisted-living facility. Long after her grandmother didn't recognize her anymore, she visited him and they would talk and play games. After he died, she cried for a while then made a new best friend. And she didn't feel guilty because making a new best friend saved her from the unbreakable pain of losing him. She was upset for Dean for thinking she sabotaged her relationship with Jackson due to guilt. After Vic left the room, Diane told Dean she knew he was in love with Vic and cautioned him to be careful not to tell her too soon because he could blow the whole thing.\n\nFinally, Diane went to Maya, who asked how they were doing as a house. Maya admitted that she was beating herself up over the decision to put them in the field together, but Diane said that wasn't her team's narrative. They didn't blame her. She then told Diane about Eyes Forward, which was drilled into her very young, to keep looking at the goal. It made her start to think of death as an escape, a time when she could finally sleep in and rest and love in peace. Diane told her she could learn to do all those things in life instead of waiting for death to free her. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Pruitt's death, Andy had a dream which included Dr. Lewis telling her that she didn't need Pruitt anymore because she wasn't a baby. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\")''\n\n\nFollowing the death of George Floyd and the start of the protests in Seattle, Maya asked Diane to come back to the station to talk to her team if any of them wanted. Diane waited in Maya's office for anyone to come in and talk. The first person to come in was Ben, who talked to her about how he taught his sons to interact with police and how it made him feel like a hypocrite. He also talked about feeling powerless against cops.\n\nWhen Maya stepped into the office to see if anyone had come to speak to Diane, Diane said only one. And Maya. She told Maya to sit down. She understood that Maya was grieving as well and dealing with everything changing. Maya talked about being taught about racism in school as if it were something in the past only to grow up and find out that wasn't true. Diane shared a similar experience learning about Native genocide. Maya shared a memory of her friends silently supporting her when her father made her run until she collapsed. Her first instinct was to do that for the Black members of her team, but she knew that wasn't enough because she had the power as an adult to stand up to injustice.\n\nDiane stepped out of the office when she saw Travis at the front desk. She asked if he wanted to talk and he told her he was going to let the Black firefighters go first. When she pointed out there wasn't a line and said she knew that it was a particularly difficult time for Asian Americans as well, he told her the story of his mother having someone spit on her at the grocery store the same day George Floyd died. He also wondered why Asian Americans were being attacked all over the country and no one was talking about it except Asian Americans.\n\nNext she spoke to Andy, who felt guilty for not having seen how difficult life is for Black Americans until she married a Black man. She faced racism as a child, but less so because she passed as white. Diane said a lot of people were waking up to this at the same time and felt the same guilty she felt. She grew up with firefighters and police. She had trouble resolving the police brutality with the cops she'd known growing up.\n\nVic came to talk to Diane next, asking how one becomes a therapist, wanting a possible backup plan if she got injured or threw a brick through police station like she wanted to. Diane explained the process and Vic said she was about eight credits shy of a bachelor's degree, because she dropped out after the theatre burned down and her favorite teacher didn't make it out. Vic shared a story of her grandmother attending protests and boycotting and how they're still having the same battle.\n\nJack told Diane he was worried about talking to people about it and getting the words wrong. He knew he wasn't racist. Diane told him that's kind of the slogan of racists. She told him about the privilege he had for being white even having grown up on the street. He said he knew that, as he and some other kids had banded together to stay safe on the streets and while running from cops, he never worried that he'd be killed if the cop caught him while some of his friends did. She talked to him about how prison is legal slavery and how he'd committed crimes himself, but never spent time in jail or prison.\n\nWhen Dean came into the office, he said nothing, but started to cry. Diane cried as well. After a few moments, he thanked her and left.\n\nAt the end of the day, Diane approached Sullivan as he cleaned the ladder truck in the barn. He said this death was different. This wasn't a split-second decision. This was the murder of an unarmed, defenseless, compliant Black man in the middle of the street in broad daylight. White people are finally started to understand the terror Black people feel. Nothing could prevent the same thing from happening to him. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station )|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to expand Crisis One to the entire SFD, Dean arranged for Diane to train them all in conflict resolution and how to deal with a variety of scenarios they might see. For the first scenario, she asked Andy and Sullivan to play a married couple with a domestic dispute. She was unaware they were separated. She played the responder in the scenario. When Sullivan had to leave to respond to a call, Theo took his place and the scenario continued. Vic swapped in as the responder, but this ended with her and Theo flirting. Dean suggested he pick the pairings to avoid interpersonal relationships, which Diane agreed to. Next, he had Jack and Maddox play co-workers, the latter of whom had locked himself in the conference room. Dean played the responder. When Maddox got very hammy, Dean accused him of not taking it seriously, so Diane called for them to take a break. For another scenario, Aquino was having a crisis and Ben played the responder and was able to talk him through it. They continued their training and at the end of the day, Diane felt they were prepared to work with the program. She had also arranged trainings with stations , , and . As she went to leave, she found Andy looking at her father's memorial. She talked to Andy about her marriage to Sullivan, saying that Andy had described their relationship as electric. People don't usually go from electric to divorced. ''(\"[[% or Nothing]]\")''\n\nShe continued to help train the other fire stations in Seattle with Vic's help as Dean pulled back to look into other options for his career. She also reported to the brass of the Department that Andy was the lone woman at station , which led to the addition of [[Deja Duval]] to the station. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Diane came into the station with a pie. She was surprised to see Vic at the desk. She had stepped in to help run Crisis One while Vic was recovering and assured Vic the program wouldn't die with Dean. When Diane pushed, Vic admitted that she felt like she wanted to crawl in a hole and let it swallow her. She felt like she couldn't because people expected her to bounce back like before. And she didn't want them to think that this death hurt more than Lucas's. Diane explained how her body might be dealing with this death differently. She believed Vic was punishing herself for not being in love with Dean, but also said Vic shouldn't. ''(\"[[Little Girl Blue]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Ben disobeyed a direct order at a scene, putting the victim and his team in danger, he was ordered to have three sessions with Diane before he could return to active duty. He cancelled on her twice, making excuses both times. Diane came to the K N Turnouts fundraiser, where she told Ben she couldn't clear him until she talked to him. ''(\"[[Searching for the Ghost]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to another firefighter. She says she hated it because she was constantly worried about him while he was fighting fires.\n\n\nShe has three children, one  year old and two preteens.\n\n\nShe and [[Sean Beckett]] knew each other when they were at the fire academy. ''(\"[[% or Nothing]]\")''\n\n\nShe was a woodland firefighter for the [[Seattle Fire Department|Seattle Fire Department]], specializing in smokejumping. During her firefighting tenure, she had a bad drop from a helicopter shattered her leg, and she decided to make a change. After learning to counsel people who had been through trauma, just like she'd been counseled after her accident, she earned her doctorate, and began counseling SFD firefighters. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\nIn addition to being a grief counselor and trauma specialist for the department, she is also certified in crisis intervention training, which she lends to the newly created Crisis One program.

When Bailey returned and found that all the food had been eaten, Elena said she shouldn't have been surprised after keeping her friends and family waiting. ''(\"[[Things We Said Today]]\")''\n\n\nBailey moved her parents to an assisted living facility in Seattle. Shortly after their move, the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle, preventing Bailey from visiting her parents. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\nWhen Bailey learned that three patients from her parents' nursing home had come into the hospital, she sent Ben to get her parents out of there. He took her father to her hotel room, but her mother was already sick and struggling to breathe, so he brought her to the hospital. She was confused and fought against the doctors, but Bailey was able to calm her by singing to her. Labs were critical, leading Bailey to realize her mother wasn't going to make it another day. She told Maggie her mother didn't want to be put on machines. She told her dad about her mother's condition and they both struggled with him not being able to be there. Elena's condition continued to decline until Bailey realized it was time. She held her mother's hand and sang to her as she died. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the overturning of Roe v.

''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n[[File:SxHerreraFamilyPhoto.png|thumb|left|A family photo of the Herreras.]]\nElena and Pruitt raised their daughter Andy together while their marriage was falling apart, resulting in frequent fights and disappointment.\n\n\nWhen Andy came home from school with a skinned knee because a boy in her class was harassing her, Elena snapped at Johnny for telling her that the boy had harassed her because he liked her. She then told Andy that if he harassed her again, Elena wanted Andy to hit him. She then had Andy start training with [[Snuffy Souza]], an MMA fighter, over Pruitt's objections. Andy continued this training through high school. ''(\"[[When the Party's Over]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Andy was nine, Elena got sick and \"died\". A week before her \"death,\" she picked Andy up from school and said they needed a fun day. They had ice cream and went to the park. Then they sat down and Elena said she'd always be there for Andy if she could, but if she couldn't, Pruitt would be and Andy had to look after him. Andy promised her mother she would. ''(\"[[Let It Burn]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Pruitt died, Andy had trouble sleeping and took medicine to help. The medicine gave her weird dreams. In one of them, she saw Elena and called out to her. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\")''\n\n\nAndy began looking into the circumstances surrounding her mother's death while sorting through Pruitt's things. She contacted Elena's sister, Sandra, looking for information. Sandra finally called Andy back and set up a meeting with her. Andy showed up to that meeting and was surprised to learn that Elena was alive after all. ''(\"[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\")''\n\nAndy quickly started having a panic attack at the realization. When she had calmed down somewhat, Sandra begged her to hear her mother out. Instead, she ran outside and started hyperventilating again. Sandra expressed regret for not having told Andy sooner. She encouraged Andy to listen to Elena. Elena explained that she had never planned to be a mother. Everyone told her she would change her mind when Andy was born. She loved Andy, but she resented her and she became depressed. She felt like a failure and wanted to die. She went to New York where her cousins lived and was a firefighter for two years before being injured out. She was devastated without Andy, but felt free. On /, while he was in New York, Pruitt went to her cousins' house and demanded to see her. He tried to bring her back with him, but she refused. When Andy heard about this, she left, telling Elena to have Sandra call her, as she'd tried to maintain a relationship with Andy while Elena hadn't. Elena later virtually attended Pruitt's funeral. ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Elena learned that Andy had killed [[Jeremy Benanti]], the man who assaulted her, she came to Seattle to see her. She went first to the fire station, where Vic and Sullivan promised to call Andy and tell her Elena was there. While they were out on a call, Elena called Sandra, who gave her Andy's address, then went to Andy's apartment, where she told Andy she'd been raped at the fire academy, but never reported it, which was why she was so insistent that Andy learn to defend herself. Andy thanked her. Then they talked about how much things in the department had changed and how much Andy was benefiting from those changes. Elena then turned on some music and the two of them danced together. ''(\"[[Death and the Maiden]]\")''\n\n\nElena, through a video call, helped Andy pick out an outfit for a date. She also praised Andy for dating outside the firehouse. She advised Andy to find a guy who could light up her whole person. ''(\"[[Pick Up The Pieces]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to [[Pruitt Herrera]]. They met at the fire academy, where they were both cadets. While he completed his training, she dropped out while she was pregnant with Andy. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n\nShe has one daughter. Before Andy, she also had a miscarriage. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\n\nAfter leaving Pruitt and Andy, she became a firefighter in New York.

Vic climbed into the car with her and started to coach her through her labor until she stopped getting responses from Josh and found that he was passed out in the road. He quickly woke up and rejoined them at the car. Shortly after, Vic found that Emmanuelle was crowning. She helped Emmanuelle, but they were distracted by the smell of gasoline. Josh looked and saw that a fire had started and gas was leaking. Vic instructed him to take the fire extinguisher and put out the flames. As he did that, Emmanuelle gave birth to their child. Just then, the rest of Station  arrived to help. Vic handed off the baby and they rushed to get Emmanuelle freed from the car. Once she was out, they put her and the baby in the ambulance.

Travis was surprised to see him when he came into the station later that morning. When the first call came in, he wasn't quick enough getting into his turnouts and into the truck, so he was left behind and got put on desk duty. He was surprised to see [[Joe (Satellite of Love)|Joe]] wandering around the station, eating the food, showering, and sleeping there. He tried to get Joe to leave, saying it would look bad for him if he couldn't get Joe to leave, but Joe listed his own problems, including homelessness and loneliness, and said Emmett's problem wasn't a real problem.\n\nHe ended up going to Sullivan to tell him about Joe and get him to leave, but found Sullivan passed out on his office floor. He saw the fentanyl vial and went to get and administer naloxone. When Sullivan didn't immediately wake up, he called his father's number, but hung up quickly when Sullivan jolted awake. Sullivan then said he had a prescription for that medication and that dizziness was a side-effect. He then told Emmett that the station runs on trust in order to get him not to tell anyone about the overdose. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett later went out on a call in which a truck hit some motorcyclists. When they discovered the driver, Maya called him over to have him intubate. With difficulty, he eventually got the tube in. Maya told him he took too long and that'll cause brain damage, but Travis stepped in and said that would be true only if the driver had any chance of survival in the first place, which he didn't. Emmett was upset that Maya had him intubate a dead guy, but Travis said that's how you learn to do intubations in high-pressure situations.\n\nAfter the call was over, Emmett went with other firefighters to get drinks. He was shocked to hear them making jokes about the carnage, but they said that's how they cope and keep doing the work day after day. ''(\"[[Born to Run]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett went out with the team on a call in which [[Kyle Rexton]] was holding a knife on a shop owner. He and Travis were tasked with securing\uathe perimeter and moving bystanders back to a safe distance. He chafed at this but did it. Then they were sent to clear out the adjacent buildings. After that was done, they were instructed to clear nearby houses. Emmett was upset with being put in danger like that and wondered when they would start saving their own lives. Travis called him out, saying he was used to getting whatever he wanted, but he was failing at this job. His father later tried to force Maya to move him to safety, but she refused, saying it was her team. After the call was over, Emmett shared with Travis that he was an Art History major until his father forced him to go to the Fire Academy. Travis called him out for that, saying people would die unnecessarily, because he's doing a job he's not cut out for. ''(\"[[Poor Wandering One]]\")''\n\n\nOn their day off, Emmett and his father showed Emmett's girlfriend, [[Alicia]], around the station and had lunch together. When they ran into Travis at the station, they invited him to join them. At lunch, Alicia told how she and Emmett had met in college and then re-met after graduation. She also showed off some of his artwork, which Travis liked. All throughout their lunch, they heard reports of a fire that was worsening as time went on. Chief Dixon was then called away to make an appearance at the fire at the request of the mayor. After he left, Travis retrieved his headphones, but before he could go home and enjoy his day off, the fire was upgraded to five-alarm and he and the whole team was called out. As they got ready to leave, Travis confronted Emmett for stringing Alicia along and said never to speak to him again if he didn't tell her the truth and set her free. Once they were dressed, they went to the scene of the fire, where Chief Dixon told them not to get killed and sent them in to work. ''(\"[[No Days Off]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett responded to a call when a band became trapped in a storage facility. They rescued the band, but learned they'd started a fire. Emmett and Travis put out the fire, but discovered it had spread to neighboring units. They exited the building and were sent to the roof to ventilate, but before they could, Travis learned the roof was too unstable for that, so they were sent back inside to find and evacuate people. After everyone was evacuated, they decided to pull out all firefighters. But since they hadn't been able to ventilate, visibility was low and they were unable to find an exit. Emmett started to panic and hyperventilate, so Travis had to calm him down and shared his oxygen tank with him. They remained trapped until Pruitt went on the roof and ventilated, improving visibility and allowing them to get enough air to exit. When they got outside, they learned what had happened. ''(\"[[I'll Be Seeing You]]\")''\n\n\nAlicia proposed to Emmett and they became engaged. The rest of the team found out when his father announced it and invited them to his country club to celebrate the engagement. Later that same day, Emmett helped Ben free two teens who were handcuffed to each other. The girl, [[Dara Agate]], then started seizing. After they got her to stop, the learned she had epilepsy, but took off her bracelet when she was with [[Tamil]] because she didn't want him to know it. Remembering that the apartment worked on trust and knowing he didn't want to be the person who kept his life hidden, Emmett decided to come out to the team. They easily accepted him, but told him he should tell Alicia. Vic then convinced Emmett and the others to pose for the calendar she was putting together to raise money to pay for Pruitt's funeral. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett went with the rest of the team to respond to a fire at a bowling alley. When they arrived, they were put on Search and Rescue. When Andy radioed out for additional help evacuating some kids, Maya told Emmett and Jack to go in. Emmett froze and said he couldn't. Maya became angry and told him to go to triage and stay out of her sight. When the call was over and they returned to the station, the team fought over who would have to be on garlic duty. Maya overheard their fighting and ordered Emmett to garlic duty or suspension. He chose garlic duty. ''(\"[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\")''\n\n\nFresh of a -hour shift, Maya volunteered Emmett to drive for the PRT, saying he'd spent his whole shift on the desk so he should be well-rested. PRT responded to an MVC, but weren't needed, so they went on to respond to a stabbing in Humboldt Park. They picked up the man who had bene stabbed and moved him into the PRT. As Ben and Jackson prepared to operate, they sent Emmett up to the front to make sure he knew the way to the hospital. When he got into the cab, he was shocked to see [[Melly Wyatt]] climb in beside him and pull out a gun, demanding that he drive. He did so, over Ben and Jackson's objections. He pretended everything was find and he just misunderstood their instructions and was looking for a safe place to stop. Melly finally let him stop the PRT and led him to the back, where he opened it up. She threatened to shoot him if they didn't give her all the painkillers they had. Ben tried to pretend they didn't have any, but she wouldn't back off. Emmett climbed into the PRT to get the drugs, but tripped on his way up, startling Melly, who fired the gun and hit Jackson in the calf. Emmett then retrieved the painkillers when Ben gave him the access code. Once she had the drugs, Melly took off but was hit and killed by a car driving past. Emmett tried to radio the call in, but he was shaking too hard, so Jackson did it. He then rode with them to the hospital to drop off Jackson so his leg could be treated. Later that night, he found Travis at the bar and told him he'd come out to his father and quit his job, saying he wasn't meant to be a firefighter. ''(\"[[Bad Guy]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett returned to the station for Sullivan's hearing to determine if he would be able to continue being a firefighter. He testified to what happened the day Sullivan overdosed, including that he didn't report the overdose at Sullivan's request. ''(\"[[We Are Family]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett continued his work doing testing and contact tracing for the hospital. When [[Marsha Smith|Marsha]] came into the hospital with likely COVID, he tested both Jack and Marcus for the virus given their contact with Marsha. Owen fast-tracked their results, which Emmett said was wrong, but understandable. ''(\"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\")''\n\nEmmett came to the station to test all the firefighters. While he was there, he talked to Travis and Vic about Vic's secret firefighter crush. As Emmett went to leave, he asked if Travis had been dating and Travis said finding his dad on there had soured things significantly. Emmett shared a story with Travis of Alicia finding a picture of some guy's junk on his phone. He passed it off as a guy from school playing a joke on him, and she believed him. It taught him that people are really good at lying to themselves for self-preservation. When Travis's father came to the door, Emmett excused himself and left early in the conversation. ''(\"[[Learning to Fly]]\")''\n\nWhen Marsha was due to be released from the hospital, Jack took the day off so they could pick her up and have a celebratory dinner. However, as they were getting ready to leave, Emmett called Jack and told him not to come as Marsha had taken a turn and wouldn't be released that day. He said Jack hadn't gotten a call because her son was her emergency contact, though he didn't know if her son had even answered the call. ''(\"[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Travis and Vic fought over her relationship with Theo, Emmett encouraged Travis to give Vic a break, warning him that it would be a lonely life if he didn't try to get over it. ''(\"[[No One is Alone]]\")''\n\nWhen they finally made up, Travis said he was glad to see them back to themselves. Travis in turn said he realized Emmett was right about him needing to move on and said he was ready to do that. Emmett then helped out with with drive-thru testing at the station. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")''\n\nEmmett came to Travis and Vic's place one morning with pastries and warned them that his father was on his way to the station. ''(\"[[Here It Comes Again]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett attended Maya and Carina's Wedding at [[Kaminski's]]. After the ceremony, he ran into Travis in the bathroom, where Travis admitted that he had feelings for Emmett that he wasn't prepared to face before, but was ready for now. Emmett said he enjoyed their friendship and wouldn't survive being hurt by Travis a second time. He then went to leave, but quickly turned around and kissed Travis. ''(\"[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett came to the Phoenix Fair. At the fair, he planned to ride in the Undies bike race, but chickened out and put his shorts back on. When [[Brad DiMarco]] became injured when a firework went off in his face and the firefighters were forced to transport him to the hospital on foot, Emmett led the way on his bike, clearing the path for them. ''(\"[[Phoenix from the Flame]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett trained as a civilian to work with the pilot program Dean started to respond to non-violent situations with unarmed responders. On their first day, they got a call to do a wellness check on a mother and daughter who had had  hangups with  in the last three days. Emmett met Vic and Dean at the apartment, where they were let inside by the landlord. They found [[Alysha]] and [[Ms. Debbie]], a mother and daughter. Debbie had multiple sclerosis and depended on the help of her daughter, who cooked and cleaned and took care of her needs. However, Alysha had started having psychiatric symptoms, which had worsened in the last few days, to the point where she feared for their safety. Emmett used his training to get Alysha to unlock the door, pretending Debbie needed medication. Once the door was unlocked, they forced their way inside and restrained Alysha to keep her from going out the window as she'd promised to do. When she fought against restraints, they were able to convince her to let them sedate her instead. Once she was sedated, they carried both mother and daughter downstairs and put them in aid cars. Emmett explained that Alysha would be admitted to the hospital for  hours and there were ways for her to get treatment even though they couldn't afford to pay. He also offered services to help Debbie. Debbie thanked him for treating her like a human being. Emmett then rode with Alysha to the hospital and they discussed how they could improve the program. ''(\"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\")''\n\nThe next call Emmett helped respond to was [[Myles Anthony Trudeau]], an autistic man who was refusing to leave a city bus at the end of its route. Emmett helped control the crowd outside while Jack talked to Myles. ''(\"[[% or Nothing]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett was at the station looking for Travis when he ran into Carina, who was using the gym. She informed him that the team was out on a call. They shared the worry that comes with loving firefighters and when Carina got a text asking her to come to the scene to treat a pregnant woman, Emmett went with her. When they arrived, Emmett stepped in to help treat Vic, who had been electrocuted. He then told Travis there were some aid cars stuck in gridlocked traffic just down the street, leading to them carrying Vic to one so she could go to the hospital. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett joined station  for Thanksgiving dinner. When Travis was distressed over his father's continued affair, Emmett tried to balance him out and encourage him to be more understanding of where Paul was. Instead, Travis pushed Paul until he came out to Nari at the station and confessed his affair.\n\nEmmett later joined the members of station  and their families for Thanksgiving dinner, provided by station  after their original meal was destroyed when a small kitchen fire activated the sprinklers. ''(\"[[Little Girl Blue]]\")''\n\n\nAbout a week before Christmas, Emmett decided he couldn't wait any longer to give Travis his Christmas gift, so he gave him a portrait he'd painted of Travis in bed. Later that day, he responded, along with Jack and Vic, to a Crisis One call. When they arrived, he told them Dispatch got a call about a woman who seemed to be having an anxiety attack. They went inside the house and found [[Amy]], who was breathing heavily in her kitchn, where a pan of eggs had been thrown to the ground. They turned off her stove and then tended to Amy. They quickly figured out that her husband, [[Greg (Season )|Greg]], was abusive and she'd actually made the call herself to buy her some time for him to calm down. They agreed that it was beyond what they could handle, so they needed to call the police. While Jack was calling police, Vic impulsively took Amy's son and tried to get her to leave. When police arrived, they found bruises on Amy and arrested Greg. Emmett then checked out Vic in the aid car, as her heart monitor had gone off. Vic then helped Amy pack and call her cousin in Portland.\n\nAfter the call, Emmett went back to the station, where they were wrapping presents to pass out to community members who might not be able to afford any. He celebrated when Maya and Carina announced they were going to start trying to have a baby. ''(\"[[All I Want for Christmas is You]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett arrived on the scene when neighbors called to report [[Harry (Season )|Harry]] yelling and pacing in his front yard. Travis took the lead on the call, talking to Harry while Andy and Emmett observed. Emmett was shocked when Travis admitted that he was falling out of love with Emmett like Harry's wife had done with him without giving Emmett any warning. After this, Emmett ignored Travis's calls. ''(\"[[The Little Things You Do Together]]\")''\n\nThings remained tense between Emmett and Travis after that, including when they responded to a Crisis One call together. Emmett arrived after Vic and Travis at a property owned by [[Virginia]], who said her tenant hadn't paid the last two months' rent and she wanted him removed from the property. They got not response when they knocked, so they pried open the door and found the tenant, Alan, long dead, likely because he was unable to afford his insulin. Vic and Travis were called away to a fire, leaving Emmett to wait for the police and fill out the report. The next morning, Emmett came to Travis's house and told him he hadn't been able to sleep the previous night because he couldn't stop thinking about them. He told Travis he forgave him and wanted to forgive what Travis had said and move forward. ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett and Travis came over on Dixon's birthday to have dinner. While they were looking through old photos of Emmett, Dixon shifted the conversation to SFD, which he believed needed more conservativism. Travis challenged him, but they were cut off by Kitty and Emmett calling them for dinner. They ate in awkward silence until Kitty brought up Alicia and her desire to have grandchildren. This led to even more awkwardness, then Dixon talking about his plans to run for mayor and his plan to shut down Crisis One if he were elected. He and Travis argued about it while Kitty tried to get them all to eat cake and Emmett told Travis it wasn't worth it. During this argument, Dixon accused Travis of taking Emmett off his path and making him gay. Emmett said that Travis hadn't made him gay. Travis stood up for Emmett, leading Emmett to say that he didn't need Travis to fight his battles. Travis said he did because it was the first time all night he'd stood up to his father. Travis and Emmett then talked outside. Travis apologized and Emmett said they both knew they shouldn't be together. He then told Travis he'd gotten into an art program in Italy. Travis said he really did care about Emmett, but they still said goodbye. ''(\"[[Alone in the Dark]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Travis Montgomery]]\nHe met and hooked up with Travis Montgomery before Travis knew he was a firefighter. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")'' Despite this, when Travis tried to talk to him about it, he said he has a girlfriend. Travis left, defeated.\ua''(\"[[Born to Run]]\")''\n\nLater, Emmett came to Travis's apartment after working and started kissing him. Travis kissed him back and pulled him inside. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\nAfter meeting Alicia, Travis told Emmett they were done because he hated what Emmett was doing to Alicia. ''(\"[[No Days Off]]\")'' Emmett told Travis he didn't want things to be over between them. ''(\"[[I'll Be Seeing You]]\")''\n\nAfter quitting his job as a firefighter, Emmett continued to have sex with Travis. While they were celebrating a successful call, Emmett took Travis outside and told him he loved him. Travis said he didn't feel the same, upsetting Emmett. ''(\"[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\")''\n\nLater, when Emmett returned to the station to testify at Sullivan's hearing, Travis approached him and asked if they could be friends, saying he needed more gay friends. ''(\"[[We Are Family]]\")''\n\nThey continued their friendship until Maya and Carina's wedding, where Travis admitted that he had feelings for Emmett and wasn't scared of them anymore, leading them to share a kiss. ''(\"[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]\")''\n\nAfter the wedding, they continued to see each other happily, despite Travis's fear that he was just setting himself up for more pain. ''(\"[[Phoenix from the Flame]]\")''\n\nSeveral months into their relationship, Emmett asked Travis to consider moving his wedding photo out of the bedroom so he didn't have to look at Michael every time they had sex. Travis, distracted by his parents, brushed off the request, upsetting Emmett. Later at the gas main explosion, Travis said he'd move the picture. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\nThings hit a snag when, while on a call, Travis admitted to a stranger that he was falling out of love with Emmett without giving Emmett a warning or a chance to fix things. Travis tried calling Emmett later, but Emmett ignored all of his calls. ''(\"[[The Little Things You Do Together]]\")''\n\nEmmett continued to ignore all his calls and texts. Finally, Emmett came to the station and said he couldn't respect himself if he stayed with Travis and asked Travis to stop trying to talk to him. ''(\"[[In My Tree]]\")''\n\nNot long after this, Travis and Emmett responded to a Crisis One call together. The next morning, Emmett came over and told Travis he forgave him for what he'd said and wanted to move forward together. ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\n[[Alicia]]\nHe and Alicia have been together for six years and first met in college, in an Art History class. ''(\"[[No Days Off]]\")''\n\nThey later became engaged. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\")'' After Emmett came out to his team, he ended the engagement. ''(\"[[Bad Guy]]\")''\n\n\n[[Michael Dixon]]\nHis father was the Fire Chief after Ripley. Emmett hid his true self because he felt his father would not approve of him.\uaDating Alicia and joining the Fire Academy was just to please his dad.\uaHe struggled with his identity because of the way he was raised. After a difficult call, Emmett came out to his dad and quit his job as a firefighter. ''(\"[[Bad Guy]]\")''\n\nAfter he came out to his father, his father refused to speak to him. ''(\"[[We Are Family]]\")''\n\n\nHe was a firefighter at station . His father says he's not a natural talent, but he works hard. He struggled from his very first day to keep up with the other firefighters. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")'' He quickly panicked when he and other firefighters became trapped in a burning building. ''(\"[[I'll Be Seeing You]]\")'' After that incident, he refused to enter a bowling alley that was on fire out of fear. ''(\"[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\")'' After being held at gunpoint by a woman seeking drugs, he decided to quit his job as a firefighter. ''(\"[[Bad Guy]]\")''\n\nAfter quitting the fire department, he got a job at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], doing contact tracing during the coronavirus pandemic.

She caught Jack's eye when she said the new fire chief looked like a sex offender. They ended up leaving the bar and having sex in a car. Jack was then horrified when she noticed her husband looking for her and even more horrified to learn that her husband is [[Rigo Vasquez]]. She was surprised at his reaction since they had met at a barbecue at the station before. ''(\"[[Indoor Fireworks]]\")''\n\nDespite being married, Eva continued to pursue Jack, coming to the station to sleep with him. After they had sex, Jack asked if Rigo was bad to her and she said he was actually great to her. ''(\"[[Eulogy]]\")''\n\nAfter having sex in a hotel room, Jack invited Eva to stay a while longer, but she left early in the morning, saying she didn't want to snuggle as she already had a husband. ''(\"[[House Where Nobody Lives]]\")''\n\n\nEva came on the team building camping trip with her husband. Despite her husband being there, she climbed into Jack's tent early in the morning so they could have sex, saying Rigo had had sleeping pills and beer. They were interrupted by the screams from [[Rachel Burke|Rachel]] and [[Scott Burke]], who'd been attacked by a bear. They waited until the rest of the campers had left to check them out before coming themselves. Their late arrival aroused some suspicion, but it passed because of the ongoing issue. Later, Eva and the others, who were searching for Scott's missing nose, encountered a bear. Eva immediately cowered to the ground. After they scared off the bear, Eva found Scott's nose. The team then left the campsite to go back home. ''(\"[[Into the Woods]]\")''\n\n\nWhile cleaning up after a rocket crash, Rigo was injured when he ignored Jack's warning not to hit some \"smoke\" (really liquid oxygen) with a fire extinguisher. Rigo was thrown back and eviscerated. He was then stabilized with REBOA in the PRT before being taken to the hospital. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")'' After his surgery, Eva was told Rigo was stable in the ICU. Later, he was able to come off the vent.\n\nJack approached Eva at the bar, offering his help to her. She rebuffed him, saying he needed to get over his guilt on his own time. ''(\"[[Born to Run]]\")''\n\nTravis and Emmett cooked some food for Eva, but when they took it to her, she said she didn't want it because she didn't want to be a widow and never see her husband again. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Jack quit his job, he reconnected with Eva and began living with her. One day, she left him handcuffed to her bed while she went to the kitchen. While she was gone, a tornado swept through and threw a tree into the side of the house, pinning Jack's handcuffed arm to the bed. Eva called for help and directed the firefighters to the bedroom when they arrived. While she got checked out at the aid car, they cut the tree, pulled it off him, and unlocked the cuff. Then they told Eva to take him to a hospital to get his injured wrist checked out. ''(\"[[Twist and Shout]]\")'' Jack didn't go right away to get his wrist checked out, instead leaving it just in a wrap, but it interfered with them being able to have sex, so he went to the ER and got a splint for the buckle fracture. He went to the bar to see her and she celebrated him being on the mend. ''(\"[[Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey]]\")''\n\nWeeks later, the tree was still stuck through the roof of the house. When Andy brought muffins and asked Jack to come back to the station, Eva got upset because she felt Andy was rude. Later, while Jack was trying to fix the roof, they got into an argument because Jack said he felt weird using Rigo's tools and Eva took one of Jack's pain pills. When Jack came back and started fixing the roof, they fought again and Eva told him that she didn't believe in God anymore because he took the wrong ones, referencing Rigo's death. ''(\"[[Dancing With Our Hands Tied]]\")''\n\n\nOn Halloween, Eva took drugs and gave some to Jack as well. The two of them went to a bar, where Jack told Eva he was hallucinating Rigo. She believed he was lying and trying to hurt her by bringing up Rigo, so she left him and began flirting with another man. When Jack approached them and tried to explain, Eva watched as the man she'd been flirting with punched Jack. ''(\"[[Demons]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Rigo Vasquez]]\nShe was married to [[Rigo Vasquez]] until his death. Despite this, she had sex with Jack after meeting him at a bar. They had met before, but Jack didn't remember this and didn't know she was married to Rigo. Even after Jack learned this, their sexual relationship continued, despite his attempts to stop it.\n\n[[Jack Gibson]]\nShe and Jack met at a bar an immediately slept together. ''(\"[[Indoor Fireworks]]\")'' Jack was horrified when he learned she was Rigo's wife, but kept having sex with her. ''(\"[[Eulogy]]\")'' This continued until Rigo was fatally injured at a scene after ignoring Jack's instructions. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\nYears later, when Jack learned that his birth parents stayed together after he was born and went on to have and raise four more children, he ended up reconnecting with Eva and they resumed their relationship.

While waiting outside the building, she collapsed and was taken to the hospital. She coded in the ER, but they were able to resuscitate. When she regained consciousness, she was worried about her son, Max, who has anxiety and likes to know what's coming and what to expect. However, when he came in so she could talk to him, she coded again and had to be rushed into surgery. There was damage to her heart that indicated a recent heart attack that hadn't been treated, likely because she thought it was just heartburn. Maggie placed an LVAD to take the pressure off her heart, but because of the severe damage she saw, she told Natalie's husband, Evan, that it was unlikely that Natalie would ever wake up. Despite this, Evan persistently refused to tell Max that his mom was dying and instead lied to him that everything would be okay. When Evan went to Natalie's room to say goodbye to her, he left Max with Andrew because he didn't want Max to see his mom like that. Andrew took Max up to the roof to talk to him about how sometimes people don't know how to tell other people bad news. He worried Max, who thought it meant that his mom was dead already, and he took off and then left the hospital on his own. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\nThe police were called to track Max down and [[Ryan Tanner]] found him walking alongside the street by himself. He called out to Max, but Max started running and fell into a manhole down into the sewer, where he was swept away. [[SFD Station ]] was called to coordinate a rescue effort. Evan asked to come along and help. They almost had him at one drain pipe, but because of an oxygen tank malfunction, Maya wasn't able to get down the sewer in time. Andy jumped down impulsively, but she wasn't able to get a proper hold on Max and he was swept away again. The last place where they had a chance to catch up to him turned out to have a very small opening, too small for an adult, so they were forced to lower a loop down to Max so he could be pulled up on his own. However, Max refused to trust his father, who had told him to let go of where he was holding and grab the loop. Evan then confessed to Max that his mother was dying and apologized for not telling him before. Max then grabbed the loop and was lifted to safety. Evan then took Max to his mother's hospital room, where he lay with his mom to say goodbye.

Grant gave Travis his number, but Travis didn't use it. They were both lured to Edith's apartment under false pretenses, where she tried to set them up. Travis told Grant he was interested in seeing him again, but when Grant tried to make plans, Travis just said he'd be in touch.\n\nThe next morning, Grant came to the station. Travis told him he doesn't date, but then Grant laid out his plans for their first few dates and Travis agreed to get breakfast. ''(\"[[Let It Burn]]\")''\n\n\nGrant made Travis the promised breakfast, eggs cooked in a jar, which he promised would be the best thing Travis ever tasted. After tasting the eggs, Travis agreed. ''(\"[[Hot Box]]\")''\n\n\nGrant went shopping with Travis one morning before work and helped him bring the groceries into the station. While he was there, Travis learned he'd made plans with Maya and Vic to do aerial yoga. Travis thought it was strange that they were making plans and walked Grant out. Grant said he didn't want Travis playing games and if he needed to go slower, that was okay. ''(\"[[Not Your Hero]]\")''\n\n\nGrant came to the hospital when he learned that Travis has been taken there. They wouldn't tell him anything at the desk because he wasn't family, but Ben and  Vic filled him in on Travis's condition. He was confused about Travis having been left alone and angry when he learned that Ben had left him. He waited with Ben and Vic for news about Travis. Travis ultimately made it through his surgery and Grant took care of him as he recovered. ''(\"[[No Recovery]]\")''\n\nAfter six weeks, Travis was ready to try to go back to work, but Grant wanted him to ask for more time off. Travis went into work one day to talk to Sullivan about that, but got caught up in helping in the search for Max and felt he was ready to step back into work. Grant was upset by this, but Travis reassured him that it was the right decision. ''(\"[[Under the Surface]]\")''\n\n\nGrant had a meeting with a restaurant investor. He needed the dry cleaning that Travis had picked up for him, which Travis accidentally left at the fire station, so Grant said he'd pick it up during his break. When he arrived, he met Sullivan and was surprised by how attractive he was. ''(\"[[Do a Little Harm...]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the restaurant where Grant works decided to stay closed during the windstorm, Grant ended up going to Friendsgiving with Travis. When he arrived, he was enlisted to help with the cooking. After the team was called away, he helped Greg, Ryan, and Pruitt move the meal to the station. While the team was gone on a call, they finished the meal and player poker while they waited for their return. When the team returned, they sat down to eat. ''(\"[[Weather the Storm]]\")''\n\nGrant expressed his desire to leave the station after Friendsgiving was over, but couldn't because it was still stormy outside. When conditions improved, Travis told him he could leave. Before he left, they got into a fight and decided to end their relationship, because they wanted different things. ''(\"[[Crash and Burn]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe started seeing Travis after his grandmother set them up. ''(\"[[Let It Burn]]\")'' Travis told Grant they they'd have to go very, very slow for him to ease back into dating. Grant was okay with that, but after a difficult shift, Travis went to Grant, kissed him, and told him he didn't want a slow burn. ''(\"[[Hot Box]]\")'' When Travis was injured in the skyscraper fire, Grant took care of him during his recovery. ''(\"[[No Recovery]]\")'' Due to Travis being injured, they skipped over a lot of the early courtship, including having sex. To combat this, Travis wore part of his fire uniform and seduced Grant. ''(\"[[Do a Little Harm...]]\")''\n\nDuring Friendsgiving, things became awkward when Greg assumed Grant and Travis were married after seeing Travis's ring and Grant denied it quickly and emphatically. This worried Travis, who asked Grant about it at the end of the day. Grant revealed that he didn't want to get married. ''(\"[[Weather the Storm]]\")'' Travis tried to talk to Grant about this, but they ended up having sex instead. Later, when Travis was left behind to look after Jack, who then ran away, they talked again. Travis said he wanted to get married again, as he had enjoyed being married. They argued over it and Travis called him Michael during the argument, so they both agreed it wasn't working and parted ways. ''(\"[[Crash and Burn]]\")''\n\n\nHe takes care of his grandmother.

Greg told Ryan that the guy hadn't been robbed and explained why. Ryan then revealed he knew the whole time, because Greg had taught him to think like a criminal his whole life.

Andy knew who he was and started to patch up his injuries. She wanted to take him to the hospital, but he refused, so she had him sign a waiver. When she and Maya were called out, Pruitt took over patching up his injuries. After a confrontation with Ryan, who believed he was lying about defending a kid, he tried to leave the station. However, when Andy and Maya returned to the station, they found him passed out in the elevator. They believed he had a cardiac bruise.

She was rushed to the ER and then immediately to the OR. Before they anesthetized her for her surgery, she complained of abdominal pain and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] discovered that she was about to give birth, despite believing she couldn't conceive. Before she could have her surgery, they needed her to give birth, so she was instructed to push. The pushing caused one of the pellets in her neck to dislodge and travel to her heart, causing arrhythmias. She was unable to see or hold her daughter before they had to anesthetize her for surgery.

''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n\nIfeya, along with her husband and daughter, went to her son's house to have dinner with him and Jack. During the dinner, Ifeya and Bill continuously tried to get Dean to join the family business. This came to a head when Yemi announced that she wanted to move out of their house, inspired by Dean. Ifeya then took Dean outside to talk to him privately, where he explained that being a firefighter is more than a job to him. He and Ifeya then made a deal that she would back off Yemi and let her move out and support her if he would go on a few dates that she set up for him. ''(\"[[Baby Boom]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Pru was born, Ifeya and Bill disapproved of how she came into the world and cut Dean off for some time. However. After the start of the [[COVID- Pandemic]] and Dean's wrongful arrest, they started to mend fences.\n\nIfeya came to Dean's house to babysit Pru while he went to work. He spent a bit of time before they left explaining to her how to take care of Pru, but she reminded him she'd taken care of kids before. ''(\"[[Here It Comes Again]]\")''\n\n\nWhen JJ's parents came to town to meet Dean and Pru, they arranged to have a dinner with Ifeya and Bill. Despite a small amount of tension, with Ifeya expressing that she didn't want Pru influenced by JJ's lifestyle, the dinner went well and JJ's parents expressed desire to continue visiting her and having a relationship with her. ''(\"[[I Guess I'm Floating]]\")''\n\n\nOn the first day of Crisis One, Ifeya went to [[Dean's Houseboat]] and babysat Pru so he could go to work. She felt it was too soon to launch the program and believed they needed more training. ''(\"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\")''\n\n\nDespite Dean's will stipulating that he wanted Pru to be raised by Ben and Bailey in the event of his death, Ifeya and Bill took her to live with them and insisted that they would be raising her instead. They also cleared out Dean's houseboat and arranged for it to be sold. When Ben and Bailey tried to reach a good solution for everyone, she refused and said she needed to override her son because she didn't believe he'd made the right decision for Pru. However, when Pru woke up that night crying for Bailey, she called Bailey and let her, along with Ben and Joey, help put Pru back to bed. ''(\"[[A House Is Not a Home]]\")''\n\nAfter months of fighting, Ifeya and Bill came to Ben and Bailey's place and told them that they wanted Pru to live with Ben and Bailey permanently, but wanted virtually all holidays and alternating birthdays. Bailey rejected the offer, saying that arrangement made them glorified nannies while Ifeya and Bill got to do all the fun things. She then implied that she was privy to some private medical information that could make the difference in court. Ifeya then told Bailey she'd had a heart attack and had had surgery to implant a pacemaker, which they were still adjusting. It made it difficult to keep up with a toddler. Ifeya and Bill then agreed to sharing the holidays, but Ifeya still asked Ben to quit firefighting, as she didn't want Pru to lose a second father to a fire.

She had a short-lived romantic relationship with Jack.\n\n\n\nInara and her son, Marcus, were living with her new husband, Ted. Marcus witnessed Ted hitting his mother and turned the burners on to fill the house with gas. Then his mother called  to report a gas leak. The firefighters responded to the calls, which happened three times in a single week. During the third call, they became suspicious that something more serious was going on, especially after Jack saw Inara signing to Marcus that daddy had calmed down. Jack separated Marcus and Inara from Ted and used sign language to learn the truth about what was happening, including that Inara didn't have anywhere else to take Marcus. She also said she'd called the police the first time it happened, but Ted convinced them she was overreacting and he'd locked her in a closet for eleven hours that night. Once he knew the truth, Jack helped Dean stall Ted while Inara went inside and packed a bag. Then they lied to Ted and said it was safe for him to stay in the house but not for Marcus and Inara to stay with him. While he was disputing this, they noticed flames in a room in the house. The fire was quickly extinguished and Ted believed that Marcus started it. When the firefighters witnessed him grabbing Marcus and yelling at him, they pulled him away. Jack then took Inara and Marcus to [[Marsha Smith|Marsha's]] house where she welcomed them to stay with her. Knowing that Inara had started the fire when she was inside packing her bag, Jack told her to flush the matches she had, throw away the clothes she was wearing, and scrub herself in the shower. She thanked him for his help. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\")''\n\n\nInara and Marcus continued to live with Marsha. Jack came by after his shift and spent time with Marsha, Inara, and Marcus, who taught him facts about dinosaurs. ''(\"[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\")''\n\nDuring the Covid- pandemic, Jack delivered groceries and supplies to them. He was unable to come inside, but flirted with Inara from a distance as she stood in the doorway. ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")''\n\nInara made energy bars for the firefighters, which she sent to the station with Jack. While he claimed the others loved them, she knew that wasn't true as she'd tasted one herself. Later, when a loose tiger became trapped in the barn at the station, Jack FaceTimed Inara and Marcus so they could see the tiger. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\nInara told Jack he didn't have to keep feeding them, but he said he wanted to. ''(\"[[We Are Family]]\")''\n\nOne day, while Inara was at work, Marsha collapsed, so Marcus texted Jack, who brought the aid car to pick her up. She was struggling to breath, so they took both her and Marcus to Grey Sloan. She was immediately tested and taken to the COVID unit. Jack and Marcus were also tested immediately and Inara was tested later. Marsha's test came back positive, but the other three tested negative. Jack was upset because Marsha had continuously refused to wear her mask. When Inara got home from work, she was worried that Marsha would die and they'd have to find another place to live. Jack offered to stay in the apartment with them until Marsha was able to come home, to keep them safe from Ted. He ended up sleeping on the couch, while Marcus slept on the floor next to him. ''(\"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\")''\n\nAfter some time in the hospital, Marsha started feeling better. She video called Inara, Jack, and Marcus asking for gossip and Inara and Jack were surprised to learn that Marcus already knew the two of them had hooked up and both he and Marsha were happy about it. Later, when Jack came home and asked Inara officially to be his girlfriend, Marcus and Marsha both celebrated. ''(\"[[Learning to Fly]]\")''\n\nMarsha's condition continued to improve until she was finally told she'd be able to go home the next day. Jack took the day off and he, Marcus, and Inara planned to come to the hospital to pick her up. However, as they were getting ready to leave, Jack got a call from Emmett telling them not to come as Marsha had taken a turn and they expected her to need to go on a ventilator later that day. Jack hadn't gotten a call as her son was her emergency contact. They were all heartbroken that they wouldn't be able to bring her home, so Maya brought the ladder truck to the hospital and Jack climbed up with Marcus and they held a sign outside Marsha's hospital window telling her to get better soon so Marcus could beat her at Parcheesi. ''(\"[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\")''\n\nInara called Jack when Marcus panicked after seeing a fire truck drive by. He was worried that something would happen to Jack while he was at work. At the advice of Theo Ruiz, whose own father was a firefighter who died in the line of duty, Jack took Marcus on a tour of the station over the phone and explained to him that most of the job wasn't very dangerous at all. This helped reassure Marcus that Jack wasn't going anywhere. ''(\"[[No One is Alone]]\")''\n\nWith Marsha on a ventilator, her son eventually stepped in and used his power of attorney to have them remove it. When the time came, Jack, Inara, and Marcus did a video call with the hospital. Her son was also on the call, but left as soon as the process was initiated. Levi explained to them that there would probably be shallowing of her breathing and it could take minutes or hours. They stayed on the call and talked to her as she breathed. Hours later, while Jack was sharing a memory of Marsha getting a pet bird to talk to, they were surprised to hear Marsha laughing. She had woken up and was breathing well enough on her own. All the firefighters celebrated along with Inara, Jack, and Marcus. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")''\n\nWhen Marsha improved enough to come home, Inara and Jack got her set up on the couch with everything she needed before they went to work for the day. ''(\"[[Here It Comes Again]]\")''\n\nAs Marsha progressed in her recovery, she offered to take Marcus to the park to work on an egg-drop project for school, giving Jack and Inara their first real alone time as a couple. They started to kiss some time after Marsha and Marcus left, but were interrupted when [[Sonia]] fell past their window into the dumpster. They rushed downstairs to help her. While Jack was talking to Sonia, keeping her calm, Inara was shocked to learn that Jack had slept with [[Eva Vasquez|a married woman]]. After Sonia was taken to the hospital, Jack and Inara returned to their alone time and had sex. ''(\"[[Comfortably Numb]]\")''\n\n\nWith the tension growing between her and Jack, Inara decided to take Marcus and move to California to live with her sister. She'd previously been unable to as Ted knew where the sister lived, but the sister had moved and Ted had gone to New York with a new woman, making Inara believe it was safe. Before she left, she attended Maya and Carina's Wedding with Jack. At the wedding, Inara stopped Jack when he started to say something. She was insistent that she was going to take Marcus and move and that Jack would stay in Seattle with Marsha. She knew that Jack wasn't in love with her, but rather with their family unit and didn't want Marcus to continue to get attached. ''(\"[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Ted]]\nShe is divorced from [[Ted]]. Because he was abusive, she lives in fear that he'll find her.\n\n[[Jack Gibson]]\nShe developed a relationship with Jack after Jack helped her escape her abusive husband and set her up to live with Marsha. Their relationship grew until one day, while Marsha was in the hospital with COVID and Marcus was asleep, they kissed and then had sex. Jack tried to talk to her about it afterward, but she said she felt good and didn't want to lose that good feeling, so she asked him to wait. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\n\nShe has one son, Marcus. She also has a sister who lives in California, whom she went to live with after she deemed it safe to do so without Ted finding her.

JJ took the smoke detector to the fire station to have it repaired and then took it home.\n\nLater, the firefighters were called to her apartment because her neighbor heard her screams. They found her on the floor, where she had fallen and hit her head. Her smoke detector was still beeping. Dean asked her if she had an attic, but she said it was more like a crawl space. He broke through the ceiling, which released smoke. He quickly picked up JJ and carried her out. ''(\"[[Invisible to Me]]\")''\n\nOutside the building, JJ protested that she didn't want to leave because she was losing all her worldly possessions. Despite this, Dean told her to stay outside. She watched as her neighbors were evacuated. When Dean brought out Seth, she worried over him because she had thought he was at work. She went with him to the hospital so he could be treated. She later showed up at the fire station and told Dean that Seth had died and she didn't know where else to go. ''(\"[[Contain the Flame]]\")''\n\nDean later came to JJ's apartment and told her the incident report from her place had been accidentally destroyed, so he had to go over things again. She realized he had made it up as an excuse to see her and ask her out on a date. She headed him off and asked him out instead.\n\nHe went back to her home that evening after a long day of work and started ranting to her about the day. When he saw her staring, he went to leave, but she interrupted him with a kiss and then he carried her back into her apartment.

When they finally came home, they had sex before Dean had to leave for work.\ua''(\"[[Hot Box]]\")''\n\n\nAfter a final hookup with Dean, JJ decided she was done with empty sex and went on a spiritual journey, looking into herself and practicing celibacy. During that time, she learned she was pregnant while on tour with Beck. Months later, she finally showed up at Dean's place to tell him she was pregnant. She apologized for not telling him sooner, but said she felt she couldn't until she felt the fetus move and realized they would be a person who had a right to know their dad. When Dean came home from work, he discovered that JJ was there. He brought her ice cream and she invited him to feel the baby moving, which delighted him. ''(\"[[House Where Nobody Lives]]\")''\n\nShe continued to stay with Dean, though she declined the offer to spend the day with him so he could avoid his work camping trip, saying she had a prenatal spa day planned. At the end of the day, she was surprised when he came home early. He told her he wanted to get married, but she made it clear that that wasn't something she wanted. He backed off and the two of them sat together and ate cheetos. ''(\"[[Into the Woods]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the blizzard, JJ was trapped along with several members of the community, at station . While she was there, she went into labor. She was upset because the blizzard made it impossible to get to the hospital for the epidural she wanted. With help from [[Carina DeLuca]] over FaceTime, Maya helped her cope with the pain, even passing on Carina's suggestion that she masturbate to relieve the pain and progress her labor. JJ then gave birth in the station bathroom. ''(\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\")''\n\nJJ refused to the name the baby immediately, saying that, like with bands, she wanted to wait until something cool happened and she just knew. Not long after that, she packed up her things and left, telling Dean she'd never intended to stay, but wanted him to have the choice to keep the baby or place her for adoption. She told Dean to give her a good name and a good life and tell her to look JJ up when she's a teenager. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\n\nSome time after leaving Seattle, JJ briefly stopped in Hong Kong on her way to an ashram in India and told her parents about Pru, prompting them to visit Seattle to meet Pru and Dean.

After Seth died, JJ came to the station and talked with Dean, explaining to him that she had nowhere else to go.\n\nLater, Dean came to her apartment and said that the accident report was damaged, so he had to do it again. JJ quickly picked up on the fact that he was making up excuses to see her, so she asked him out on a date.\n\nDean came back and started ranting about his day, and was getting ready to leave after he saw JJ staring at him, but she kissed him and they went back to the apartment, with Dean carrying her.

He didn't get adopted and instead grew up in foster care. He was almost adopted into one family with two siblings in June , until their house caught fire due to an old faulty oven. Jack ran into the house and helped to save his brother but his parents didn't make it and he got separated from his brother and sister. After a while, he ended up in a group home with a lot of other kids, who became his family until he joined the Seattle Fire Department and found his family there. During his time in the group home, he had night terrors, which freaked out all the kids except one girl.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguisher, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFrankel came to the station and explained to Jack and Andy the procedure for choosing a new captain, which would take months. She said they'd alternate as captain each shift until then. Andy went first. She had the team do air consumption drills with new partners. Frankel watched for a while and then said she could stop back in anytime.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went to continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed. Back on the ground, Frankel admonished both Jack and Andy for their choices, saying Andy should have listened to Jack's experience and Jack should have followed orders.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.\n\nLater, when Jack submitted an incident report for the pool party call, Frankel talked to him about the adversity she'd faced and the respect she earned. She shared a concern that Andy had been handed things. Jack corrected her that Andy hadn't had anything handed to her and if anything, her father held her back.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lynn (Station )|Lynn]] came into the station to have her car seats installed, Pruitt pressured Jack to do it personally.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time, and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy and Jack carpooled to The Incinerator, a test to determine one's suitability to be Captain. They arrived surprised to find so many candidates and only one open spot. They were put in a group with [[Charlotte Dearborn]] and [[Cole Edmonds]] to take the test. Cole went first and expected the women to watch while he and Jack did the rescue and talked down to them. Next was Charlotte, who was cavalier about safety, though she set a record time. During Jack's turn, they put out the fire, but after multiple sweeps, they didn't find the dummy, so Jack made the decision to leave without it. On the outside, he was informed that very few people mastered that variation of the test and there was no dummy in the first place. Finally, it was Andy's turn. She emphasized them working as a team. She had them hold on to each other due to low visibility. The building started to creak as they crawled along and eventually, the roof collapsed, separating them. Cole didn't respond to her calls, so they had to find him. He was unconscious. Charlotte then called for a mayday over Andy's objections. Frankel ordered everyone out, but Andy decided to stay in and find the dummy. Jack stayed with her and they retrieved the dummy. Once they were out, Frankel berated Andy for her decision to ignore the mayday call. Ripley interrupted and said he understood Andy's call, but they have rules for a reason. It's a Captain's job to remember that. In a real call, they'd all have come out in body bags. He understood but didn't agree with, her call. On the way home, Jack said he needed to win it because he was still in it, but Andy refused to talk to him about it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDuring a shift when Andy was supposed to be Captain, Jack had to step in when Andy accompanied her father to the hospital.\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called to\uarespond.\uaJack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Jack and Ryan shook hands and each agreed that the other had done good work.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. With the fire in the house, the garage started to heat up. They searched for anything they could use to try to free themselves. They found a toolkit, which Karen used to pick the lock on the trunk of the car and retrieve a jack. They tried to use the jack to lift the garage door, but it wouldn't budge. As the temperature climbed, Ryan decided to hotwire the car and try to use it as a battering ram. Jack said it was a bad idea, but Ryan started it anyway. Andy was able to stop him before he moved the car. Jack had the idea to use the motor from the internal door to get access to the house. It didn't work and they started to wear out. When Pruitt arrived and gave Andy a pep talk, she used the last of her energy to think of a plan. She saw the water heater and decided they could use the pilot light to create an explosion. They siphoned gas from the car and rigged the water heater up to explode and propel itself through the garage door. It worked and once they were free, they were all cooled down and rehydrated.\n\nWhen Jack later asked Dean what happened with the access pad, Vic covered for him and he assured her there wouldn't be\uaa next time.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack was waiting for his final captain interview, a page came in about a skyscraper fire downtown, so Ripley said the interviews were being postponed until further notice. He then told Andy that if he didn't get captain, he was putting in for a transfer to another station.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the active fire, they worked with Charlotte, who made the decision to jump through the fire to try to get to a fire door. Then there was a crash and she didn't respond. Andy jumped after her and found her injured. She used an extinguisher sphere to put out the flames and let the rest of the group come help her free Charlotte. Andy took Charlotte down to triage and because the fire was contained, she sent Jack and Dean to the floor above to check it out. On that floor, they found a large number of combustibles. A rapid evacuation was started. Andy dropped Charlotte at triage and then went back up to the top floor to tell them to get ready for evacuation. Then she went back downstairs and helped Ripley pack up and evacuate base camp. When Jack and Dean found a civilian as they closed fire doors, they called for an elevator evacuation. Ripley said no, but Andy took the elevator key and sent the elevator up. Jack sent Dean down with the civilian and continued his work. He talked to Andy through the elevator shaft. She tried to convince him to find a way out, but he said he wasn't willing to sacrifice the lives of anyone on the team to try to save himself. She asked him to stay on the radio, which he did until it cut out a few minutes later. Then there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nJack was trapped under a pile of debris which was getting hotter and hotter. He was stuck there for so long without being able to move that his PASS device activated. He thought he was going to die. Andy and Maya went up to the floor where he was and pried open a door to get access. They then followed the sound of his PASS device to find him. They pulled the rubble off him and the three of them evacuated the building together. Outside, Andy evaluated Jack, who insisted that he was okay.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nIn order to foster cooperation between the fire department and police department, Sullivan sent Jack on a ride-along with Ryan. Ryan told Jack he wasn't allowed to leave the squad car for any reason because he was a civilian. They were on traffic duty. They first pulled over [[Vince (Home To Hold Onto)|Vince]], who was speeding to get home because he had burned himself on hot coffee and wasn't wearing pants or underwear. Jack used the megaphone to ask Vince about his burn and then advised him that he'd need medical attention and offered a police escort to the hospital. After that was complete, Ryan pulled over [[Gregory Dougal]], who was also speeding. He said he was on the way to a birthday party with his daughter, [[Lindy Dougal|Lindy]]. Ryan said he'd be right back and went back to the squad car. He immediately radioed in to say he suspected a child abduction. Jack was shocked that Ryan had figured that out based just on the traffic stop. Ryan pointed out what he'd seen and confirmed that there was an Amber alert out for Lindy, who was the subject of a custody dispute. They waited for backup, but when Gregory clearly became restless, Ryan went over to the car and calmly told him not to do what he was planning because it wouldn't end well for him. He was able to talk Gregory into surrendering. Jack sat with Lindy until her mom came. The mom thanked him, even though he tried to tell her that Ryan was actually the hero. When Jack told Ryan about that, he said he's used to it because cops aren't seen as heroes like firefighters are.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Maya was paired with Jack to teach one group, which included [[Elle Kingsley]]. They both flirted with her and spent the whole day trying to outdo each other for her affection. When Sullivan saw them laughing and felt they weren't taking it seriously, he called Maya out on it, which eventually got him sent home for the rest of the shift. At the end of the day, both Jack and Maya got Elle's number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nJack continued to have trouble sleeping and what little sleep he got was plagued by nightmares of being trapped in the skyscraper.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station, where he played poker with the others and anxiously waited for news. At the end of the day, he got into a spat with Pruitt after Pruitt expressed concern about Jack's lack of sleep. When the team returned to the station, they all sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter being called out by Pruitt for not getting Jack help, Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and they left to find Andy. Jack then quickly left the station and wouldn't answer his phone.\n\nJack went to four months of therapy three times a week. He said he felt ready to go back to work, but she said he needed to deal with whatever was still keeping him up at night. He was still not speaking to Dean because he felt like Dean had betrayed him. Maya met Jack after every single therapy session, even though he said it wasn't necessary.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nJack was finally cleared to go back to work, though he was still fighting with Dean. After months of rehab, Sullivan was also ready to go back to work. Pruitt criticized him for missing Jack's PTSD and not seeing that regular drop-ins weren't coming in anymore. This inspired Sullivan to take Ben and Jack for a wellness check on a drop-in Pruitt specifically mentioned. They went to his house and did an exam. He revealed that Sullivan was the reason he stopped checking in. His car was busted, leaving him unable to pick up his medications. Ben then heard regurgitation in his heart. He didn't want to go to the hospital, but he collapsed trying to fight them off. Sullivan distracted him with a game of chess as they worked to get him stable while they waited for an aid car. He stabilized, then checkmated Sullivan. After they sent him to the hospital, they remembered that he mentioned his car wasn't working, so they went to his garage and fixed it.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nMaya and Jack were called out to the transit tunnel for an unknown medical emergency. They arrived to learn that a subway had malfunctioned and multiple passengers were injured in a minor fall. Once they boarded the car, they started treating the injuries, which all seemed minor. One of the injured was [[Will (Crazy Train)|Will]], who didn't want to let Maya check him out, but agreed when Maya asked directly. She examined him and asked about his cough, but his father didn't know how long he'd had it. Will coughed up blood and Maya noticed that he'd been on an international flight. He'd come from Bashran, in the middle east. Maya consulted with Jack and said she believed they were dealing with a contagious illness and needed to go on lockdown. They radioed out for CDC, which confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in Bashran and said they'd be on their way. They also noted that another passenger, [[Neil]], had come in on the same flight. They talked to Will's father and explained the situation and then made an announcement to the whole car. While they were working, Maya told Jack that she believed he had lied about being fine to get back to work. The situation escalated when Neil's condition worsened and he collapsed on the floor. They put in an IV and used lidocaine to restore sinus rhythm. He stabilized, but then Will collapsed. While Maya and Jack were distracted, [[Reese]] tried to leave, but [[Kenneth]], a security guard, used a taser on him, which set off a cardiac episode. He took the heart monitor off Neil and put it on Reese, which revealed ventricular arrhythmia. They didn't have any more lidocaine to treat him, so Maya went through the Aid Car, asking the passengers to show her any medications they had. While she was working on that, Reese flatlined and Neil stopped breathing. Jack asked the passengers to help and handed out assignments. They were able to stabilize Reese but realized Will needed blood. Desperate, Jack used Harold as a donor for his own son. After a rough moment, all the patients were stable. The CDC then arrived and set up decontamination so all the passengers could leave. Jack and Maya's tests showed that they weren't infected. After being decontaminated, the two of them went back to Maya's place and had sex in her shower.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStill upset with Dean for his part in the intervention, Jack called Dean's family and set up a dinner with them.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> However, before the dinner could happen, Dean's family canceled and Jack was trying to reschedule.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFinally, Jack was able to reschedule the dinner. Ifeya, Bill, and Yemi Miller came over. Ifeya and Bill continued to try to pressure Dean to quit firefighting and join the family business. He said he wouldn't and after Yemi, inspired by Dean, told them she wanted to move out of their house, Ifeya insisted on speaking to Dean alone. He told her about how firefighting is more than just a job to him and got her to give Yemi the same support she gave him by agreeing to go on a few dates she set up. After the dinner, Dean proclaimed Jack an honorary Miller.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJack knows how to get things done and isn't usually afraid to break the rules in order to save people. Jack is caring, passionate, and energetic especially when it comes to Andy Herrera.\n\n\n\n[[Andy Herrera]]\nJack and Andy secretly began sleeping together. When she found an engagement ring while they were having sex, she freaked out. Later, when Jack lost Pruitt while they were in a fire together, Andy got angry with him. With Pruitt stepping down, Jack and Andy had to work as co-captains together, further straining the relationship.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe two continuously bickered because of their different leadership styles, but\uathey began sleeping with each other again after a while to relieve the tension and postpone the conversation they knew they needed to have. He decided that sex was not enough for him and that he wanted more, to build a home with someone. Andy said she didn't want more and that the team and the station were her home. As they were arguing over this, they failed to properly dress and Pruitt caught them when he came to fetch documents from the captain's office.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref> Under pressure from Pruitt, they told the team about their relationship. The team was mostly supportive but only worried about who they'd saved first in a fire. Their worries were abated when Jack and Andy said they'd ended things.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Elle Kingsley]]\nJack flirted with Elle at a training for police officers and spent the day competing with Maya for her affection. At the end of the day, both he and Maya got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Maya Bishop]]\nMaya and Jack first met on Maya and Andy's first day at Station . Jack jokingly asked if he could touch Maya's Olympic Gold Medal for luck, but Maya immediately refused, telling him it wasn't luck but hard work and it proved how much better she was than him. Then, Maya and Andy both agreed that Jack was \"very ew\".<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> Maya was the only person who knew about Jack and Andy's secret relationship, the latter's proposal, and their subsequent breakup. She was often antagonistic towards Jack, making smack talk about him behind his back and she had clearly sided with Andy during the captain's race.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> However, when Andy and Jack got back together, Maya didn't know and was hurt when she found out, thinking Andy had betrayed her, but the girls resolved their differences.<ref>[[Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref> Later, at the skyscraper, Maya helped Andy look for Jack.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the skyscraper and the end of Andy and Jack's relationship, Maya and Jack were often seen bickering and throwing light-hearted insults at each other. When Ripley revealed that Maya had applied to be a lieutenant, Jack told her he was ready to take her on if she tried to take his job since there could only be two lieutenants at the station. At the police training, they worked together and competed for the attention of policewoman [[Elle Kingsley]], and eventually both got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...|Do A Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> When Pruitt drew everyone's attention to Jack's PTSD, Maya participated in the intervention. However, Jack got angry at everyone and told Maya she had no chance to take his job from him. When the team went to look for Herrera and Sullivan, Pruitt as acting captain benched Jack and ordered Maya to act as temporary lieutenant. Four months after the windstorm, Maya was meeting Jack after every therapy session and showing her support, telling him he would eventually return to active duty. She also invited him to Andy's party, but he declined.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Jack were both on Aid Car during the next shift, but Maya didn't think that Jack was ready to be back to work. The two responded to the train crash which turned into an infectious disease call and even though they were arguing in the beginning, they later started working together to treat the patients. Afterwards, while waiting to be cleared, the two resolved their differences and later had sex while showering at Maya's apartment.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref> While Jack wanted to clear things up between them, Maya told him she was telling Andy about what had happened and that nothing would happen between them ever again. However, when Maya tried to tell Andy, they were interrupted by Ryan and his date.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\nLater, Maya noticed that Jack was doing the quiet thing, meaning he was angry and out of concern, she asked what happened. Jack told her that seeing Dean with his family brought up feelings about his own and he told Maya that he didn't actually know who his biological parents were. Maya tried helping him by suggesting he internet-stalk them, but he brushed her off and told her he didn't want her help. However, Maya still cared and she told him so on the rooftop of the station, adding that he was the last person she expected to care about. She then walked away, but turned around and kissed him passionately.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref> The two then continued to hook up in secret. While having beer for breakfast after shift at the houseboat, Miller asked Jack to point out why Maya would make a terrible fake girlfriend for him, but Jack simply complimented Maya, saying that \"her eyes sparkle even in the dark\", proving he also had feelings for her.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy brought up the fact that she and Jack were on good terms, Jack went to Maya and told her they needed to tell Andy, but Maya suggested they have a last secret hookup in a supply closet before telling Andy the truth. However, Andy found them and she and Maya got into a big argument about it as Andy felt humiliated.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> During overhaul at the coffee processing plant, Dean revealed that he knew about Maya and Jack as they often snuck in and out of the houseboat and Maya was eager to talk to someone about all of her feelings as Andy was still mad at her.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Ripley died, Maya was visibly sad and constantly crying and Jack tried to ask her what was going on, but Maya denied the fact that she was crying. Later, Dean used an analogy with sea anemones to explain their behavior to them why Maya was crying and the fact that Jack wasn't actually annoyed with her as well as the fact that the two didn't know how to act now that they were officially together. At the funeral, Maya held Jack's hand during Sullivan's eulogy.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the bar crash, Maya sat down with Jack and told him he is good in bed and he is a good guy. He caught on to what Maya was intending. He asked if it was because she was interested in getting promoted to captain. She neglected to answer the question. She said they should just be friends.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Inara]]\nAfter helping Inara escape from an abusive husband at a fire call, he moved Inara and her son Marcus in with Marsha.\n\n\nHis most recent foster parents got married after  months of dating.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Dean Miller]]\nJack met Dean at the fire academy. Dean helped Jack get through Hazardous Materials and Jack helped Dean get through Resource Deployment. Their friendship has remained strong.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref> During their time at the academy, they initially didn't get along and even ended up getting in a physical fight, which nearly got them kicked out.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> They ended up working together at Station  after the academy and became best friends.\n\nAfter learning that Dean lived on the water, Jack was surprised Dean had never invited him over before.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref> When Dean learned that Jack had grown up in foster care, he was upset that Jack hadn't told him before, but then asked Jack to move in with him, believing that that's what Jack wanted all along.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> After Jack moved in, Dean woke up to find Jack rearranging the furniture.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nHe became angry with Dean when Dean told Pruitt about his PTSD. This led to him not speaking to Dean for months.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref> When he finally returned to work, he spoke to Dean only to tell him that he'd called Dean's family and made them talk to him, as payback for what Dean had done.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Ryan Tanner]]\nAfter Jack went on a ride-along with Ryan, they buried the hatchet and went to Dean's after work to share a drink and hang out.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Pruitt Herrera]]\nPruitt was Jack's mentor.\n\n\nJack is a Lieutenant at [[SFD Station |Station ]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]].\n\nAfter Pruitt Herrera was diagnosed with cancer, Jack and Andy became the acting captains of Station , with one of them running each shift.

He tried to leave the hospital, but Jo caught him and told him explicitly what could happen if he tried to leave before he got treatment in order to convince him to stay. He later had surgery on his arm. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, Joey was reluctant to do his PT. Cormac initially thought he was bored by it, so he brought in a video game that used the same motions and said he could play that instead. He told them he couldn't play video games or enjoy being safe and warm without knowing his siblings were okay, too. Bailey then made some calls and arranged for his siblings to come to the hospital for pizza and video games, which reassured him greatly.

He also turned eighteen, but declined to meet with his social worker to discuss his options for continued foster care or group homes. Upset that he was being discharged during a blizzard with nowhere to go, Bailey invited him to come to her house and stay with her family, which he accepted.

They ate voraciously, then discussed their mutual desire to go down the fire pole, which Ben said they couldn't do. When they cleared their plates, they asked if they could go get more, which Ben said they could. ''(\"[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\")''\n\n\nAt the start of the Covid- pandemic, Ben's sister Rosalind came to live at her brother's house to watch Tuck and Joey while Ben and Bailey both quarantined due to their work.

Tuck lashed out, fleeing to his room and refusing to speak to anyone, even Joey. Ben made spaghetti to draw him out. Joey then sat down with Ben and they talked about having lost people before. Joey talked about the difficulty of being separated from his foster siblings and Ben offered to have a barbecue at the end of the pandemic and inviting all of them over. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd, protests cropped around the country, including many in Seattle. Joey and Tuck asked Ben if they could join the protests, saying they wanted to march for themselves and for Rosalind. Ben finally agreed and they marched along the rest of Station . ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station )|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Bailey found a lump in Ben's testicle that a urologist determined was most likely cancerous, Joey immediately took an interest in the surgery he'd need to have to remove his testicle and hopefully all the cancer. This conversation led to a discussion of Joey's future and if he wanted to go to medical school. When he expressed concern over the cost, Ben easily said they could help with that. ''(\"[[I Guess I'm Floating]]\")''\n\nWhile Ben had his orchiectomy, he dreamed that Joey was helping a version of Ben himself operate. ''(\"[[Comfortably Numb]]\")''\n\n\nJoey shadowed Ben for a whole shift while he was on aid car to get an experience for his college essay. Their first call out was to an encampment like the one Joey had lived in prior to meeting Bailey. Joey quickly recognized their patient as [[Ameen Deng]], a friend of his with a heart condition. While Joey watched, Ben and Jack began treating Ameen. When he coded, Joey told them he was DNR, but without legal paperwork, Ben and Jack were forced to continue treatment over Joey's objections. The CPR was unsuccessful and Ben radioed to Grey Sloan to have a physician pronounce him dead remotely. The next day, near the end of the shift, Joey told Ben he'd finished his essay, which he'd written on the failure of emergency healthcare in the US. ''(\"[[Too Darn Hot]]\")''\n\n\nOne evening, while they were eating dinner amidst the dispute over Pru's custody, Ifeya called Bailey becuase Pru had woken up crying for her. With Joey and Ben's help, Bailey was able to soothe Pru to sleep over the phone. ''(\"[[A House Is Not a Home]]\")''\n\nWhen Ifeya and Bill agreed to allow Pru to live with Ben and Bailey, Joey happily helped them welcome her home. To help nurture her Nigerian culture, Joey found a Nigerian grocery nearby and began cooking with ingredients found there. ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\n\nJoey attended the party Ben and Bailey threw at the station for Pru. ''(\"[[Crawl Out Through the Fallout]]\")''\n\n\nOn Halloween, Joey brought Pru to the Station  open house. He dressed as a referee while Pru was Megan Rapinoe, a change from the firefighter costume she'd originally planned to wear. ''(\"[[Demons]]\")''\n\n\n\nAfter his parents died in a car accident when he was five, he ended up in foster care. After several years, he was placed in a house with [[Frank]], [[Sarah (House Where Nobody Lives)|Sarah]], and [[Ernie (House Where Nobody Lives)|Ernie]].

On their way back afterward, Maddox and Dan talked about Sullivan knocking a kid's cell phone out of his hand when he tried recording the injured firefighters. Andy defended Sullivan, saying he was a better firefighter than Maddox and didn't cook his lid to look like he'd seen action. She also reminded Maddox about the statistics regarding firefighters and cancer. ''(\"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to expand Crisis One to the entire SFD, Dean arranged for Diane to train them all in conflict resolution and how to deal with a variety of scenarios they might see. For the first scenario, she asked Andy and Sullivan to play a married couple with a domestic dispute. She was unaware they were separated. She played the responder in the scenario. When Sullivan had to leave to respond to a call, Theo took his place and the scenario continued. Vic swapped in as the responder, but this ended with her and Theo flirting. Dean suggested he pick the pairings to avoid interpersonal relationships, which Diane agreed to. Next, he had Jack and Maddox play co-workers, the latter of whom had locked himself in the conference room. Dean played the responder. When Maddox got very hammy, Dean accused him of not taking it seriously, so Diane called for them to take a break. For another scenario, Aquino was having a crisis and Ben played the responder and was able to talk him through it. They continued their training and at the end of the day, Diane felt they were prepared to work with the program. ''(\"[[% or Nothing]]\")''\n\n\nMaddox accompanied the rest of station  when they were called as backup after a gas main explosion about half a mile from station . On the way, he called the new probie, [[Deja Duval]], feisty. When Andy defended her, saying she wasn't a chihuahua, Deja said she could take a compliment.\n\nAfter [[Pat Aquino]] and [[Dean Miller]] were seriously injured, station  drove to the hospital. Deja asked if the shift was normal and Theo told her that it wasn't. They all cried together, despite Andy's insistence that Dean would live. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\n\nAndy stepped in as acting captain while Aquino recovered. During this time, Maddox contineud to make sexist remarks, especially toward Deja, in the name of hazing her. Also, while they were fighting a large apartment fire, Andy send Maddox and Deja to evacuate the building, when when they got inside, Maddox abandoned Deja and went on fire attack instead. When they returned to the station, Andy called everyone's attention to her and said that the attitude around the station needed to change, that the hazing and the sexism and ignoring her orders needed to stop or there would be consequences. In particular, she said Maddox's actions had earned him a new role as fire prevention coordinator and fixing the paperwork would mean six or seven shifts of desk duty. ''(\"[[A House Is Not a Home]]\")''\n\nMcCallister took early retirement after the gas main explosion, leading to the appointment of [[Natasha Ross]] as the new fire chief. She visited both station  and  to meet all the firefighters. After her visit to , they were called out to Leon's Ridge, where a car had gone over a cliff. Maddox helped at the top of the cliff, blocking traffic and operating the ladder to drop a basket down to retrieve [[Owen Hunt]] from the car. ''(\"[[Started from the Bottom]]\")''\n\n\nMaddox, along with the rest of stations  and , participated in the K N Turnouts fundraiser. After it was over, all the members of  went home to enjoy their day off. ''(\"[[Searching for the Ghost]]\")''\n\n\nMaddox and the rest of station  responded to a call about a skydiver who had gotten caught in a tree. They arrived on the scene to find [[Sam]], who was impaled on a tree branch in multiple places. She regained consciousness shortly after they arrived. Andy sent Maddox and Theo up into the tree to start cutting her free. While they were working, Maddox dropped his saw, which made Sam start to panic. Wanting to keep her calm, Andy climbed up the ladder herself and helped get Sam free. Once the branches were cut, they put her on a stretcher, but she coded. Andy did CPR on the way to the hospital, but they were unable to resuscitate her. ''(\"[[In My Tree]]\")''\n\n\nOn their next shift, Ross visited the station and told them she was shutting the station down. She informed them they'd all receive reassignments or severances soon. The station was then called out to a fire at a candy factory. With difficulty, they were able to put the fire out.\n\nThe next morning, as the next shift arrived to relieve them, Andy gave a speech about them all being part of the history of . ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\nThe firefighters gathered at the station one last time, taking pictures, before the flag was lowered and the lights were turned off for the last time. Then they went to Joe's for drinks, where Andy bought the first round for everyone. They then sat and shared stories of calls they'd been on together. When Deja overheard Andy telling Theo about her conversation with Ross, she told the others and they all became upset with Andy, blaming her for the station being closed, and left.

She then revealed that she'd left Lane and apologized to Maya for not protecting her from the abuse. Maya said she loved her dad and didn't believe he was abusive. She told her mother she was just being dramatic. When the team was called out, Maya left, but Katherine stayed at the station. Hearing Ben and Sullivan fight made her nervous, so she kept busy by helping set up the tables for that night's spaghetti dinner. When Maya returned, she was upset with her mother for coming into her workplace and taking over. She re-iterated that her father was the reason she won a gold medal and said that Katherine needed therapy, but she didn't think she did.

''(\"[[Comfortably Numb]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of her wedding, Maya went to her parents' house, where she officially came out to them for the first time ever and told them she was marrying a woman she loved. She also told her mother that she deserved better than to be cowering in the hallway behind her husband. She said Carina offered to have Katherine come live with them, something Maya herself wanted, and said that if she decided she'd had enough, she knew where they lived and there would always be a bed there for her. When Lane tried to object, Maya silenced him. Katherine later attended the wedding without Lane. ''(\"[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]\")''\n\nAt the wedding, Maya and her team found out that Maya had been fired as Captain. She, Carina, and Andy went to Fire Chief McCallister's office in an attempt to convince him to reverse his decision, yet to no avail. A disappointed Maya returned to the party and informed the guests of what had happened.

She told them she was a cadet at the fire academy and was checking out each station to see where she might fit in once she was finished with her training. She didn't feel like she was good enough to get a spot at station . Andy offered to give her a proper tour of the station and some advice on how to get better. She and Vic had her squeeze rice to improve her grip strength and re-dressed an injury she'd patched up herself. At the end of the day, Andy also introduced her to Sullivan, saying she's station  material. ''(\"[[Crazy Train]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Kat's friend and the only other female in her academy class quit, Kat came back to the station to talk to Andy again. Andy told her about meeting Maya in training and relying on her. Andy worried Kat was thinking about quitting herself, so she asked Sullivan for permission to take her on a call with them. She was able to persuade him to let Kat observe. They were called to an apartment building where [[Penelope Hayes]] had gone missing while playing hide-and-seek with her brother. She was considered high-risk because she had asthma, which her brother said was triggered by her being scared. Kat joined Andy and Jack to search a portion of the building. However, when they met up with Ryan and Jenna, who were also searching, Kat suggested redistributing the teams so each team had one firefighter and one police officer, a technique she'd just learned in training. Kat and Andy continued the search with Jenna. They heard from another building resident that Penny liked to hang out in the basement, so they went there to search and found her trapped in a washer. They couldn't get it open, so they had to call for backup. The backup arrived, but also brought news of a gas leak in the building, which had forced an evacuation. Due to the danger, Andy sent Kat out along with everyone else but Sullivan, who helped her free Penny. Later, Andy apologized to Kat for putting her in danger like that and then being brusque with her when sending her out, but Kat said that going on the call was the best thing she did.

She said Carina offered to have Katherine come live with them, something Maya herself wanted, and said that if she decided she'd had enough, she knew where they lived and there would always be a bed there for her.

When they arrived, Robert recognized one of the cars as belonging to his wife, so he immediately rushed to help her. He tried to break protocol to help her, but Lucas told him he was too close to the situation and needed to back off. Claire died, which strained their friendship. ''(\"[[Do a Little Harm...]]\")''\n\n\nBy , Ripley had become the Fire Chief of the Seattle Fire Department. When Station 's Captain Kennedy was promoted to Battalion Chief, Ripley appointed the station's relatively new Lieutenant [[Theo Ruiz]] as Captain. Not too long after his promotion, Theo made a fatal error on a call that led to the death of his long-time friend [[Michael Cooper Williams|Michael Williams]], husband to fellow firefighter [[Travis Montgomery]]. Crushed by guilt, Ruiz asked for a demotion after the tragic event. While Ripley initially tried to fight him on it, he agreed and Ruiz was demoted back to Lieutenant. ''(\"[[No One is Alone]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the captain candidates came out for their practical tests after taking their written exams, Ripley unexpectedly came out to observe. He watched as each team of four took turns acting as captain. When Jack decided to leave without the dummy after two sweeps turned up nothing, Ripley complimented him on being the first person in fire years to master that variation. After Andy had her turn and had to call for mayday when [[Cole Edmonds]] was hit by falling debris, he witnessed [[Battalion Chief Frankel]] berating her over her decision to stay in and find the dummy instead of coming out. He told her he'd speak to her about it later, as she was meant to judge the candidates impartially. He then told Andy that part of being captain is making tough decisions, like between the ethical choice to continue rescuing the dummy or the safer choice of coming out. ''(\"[[Stronger Together]]\")''\n\n\nRipley came out to the strip mall fire. He was surprised to see Jack in charge instead of Andy, but Jack told him Andy had to take a personal day. ''(\"[[Let It Burn]]\")''\n\n\nBelieving that Frankel had shown bias in the issue, Ripley decided to interview the crew of Station  himself, getting their input on who should be captain. After interviewing all of them, he went to the hospital to interview Pruitt, who said he wouldn't recommend either Jack or Andy to be Captain. ''(\"[[Every Second Counts]]\")''\n\n\nWhile doing the final interviews of the Captain candidates, he was paged away to a skyscraper fire in downtown Seattle. He said the interviews were postponed until further notice. When Station  arrived at the fire, he gave them directions. When he learned that there were combustibles on a floor above the fire, he sent Ben and Travis to vent the stairway so civilians on the top floor could get out. While that was happening, the fire jumped floors between the panes of glass in the window. Ripley was helping evacuate the base camp they had set up, when Jack radioed down and said there was a trapped civilian and they needed elevator rescue. Ripley said that wasn't possible because they couldn't jump the fire in the elevator or risk spreading the fire through the elevator shaft. Despite this order, Andy took the elevator key and sent it up to them. Ripley told her making tough calls like this was part of the job she wanted. He took the key back from her and went out down the stairs. ''(\"[[Not Your Hero]]\")''\n\nAndy asked Ripley over the radio for help to rescue Jack, but he refused and ordered Andy to leave the building herself because it wasn't safe to be there. Despite this order, Andy stayed in the building to save Jack. Dean soon came out of the building and also requested help to go rescue Jack, which was also refused. Ripley told him to help the people already outside. Against this order, Dean re-entered the building. When Vic exited the building with Travis, he asked how they were all doing. Vic didn't believe he cared, but he insisted that he cares more than she could know. He also said that if she came at him like that again, she'd be fired. ''(\"[[No Recovery]]\")''\n\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], their new captain, who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately. ''(\"[[No Recovery]]\")''\n\n\nRipley attended a peer group for firefighters, where he talked about being haunted by the skyscraper fire and the choices he had to make that day. After the group was over, Vic approached him and apologized for the way she spoke to him during the skyscraper fire. He said she should share her own experience because it might help others. ''(\"[[Lost and Found]]\")''\n\n\nRipley came to a training held by the firefighters of Station  for the police department, training them in CPR and first aid. When Ripley noticed Sullivan being particularly hard on Maya and singling her out, he sent Sullivan home, knowing that it was the anniversary of his wife's death. ''(\"[[Do a Little Harm...]]\")''\n\n\nRipley attended Dean's surprise birthday party, where he flirted with Vic over cutting the cake. After the party, they went home together. ''(\"[[Do a Little Harm...]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the windstorm, the team was called in because B shift was stranded. At the station, they were surprised to see Ripley there, checking on the stations. They went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. After breaking up the whole tree, they finished the drive to the house, where a fire had started during a rescue. The fire was then extinguished. Ripley then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station . ''(\"[[Weather the Storm]]\")''\n\nRipley got a call that Andy and Sullivan hadn't been heard from in over an hour and hadn't arrived at their last known destination. He was called back to headquarters, so he left Pruitt to act as Captain during the rescue mission. ''(\"[[Crash and Burn]]\")''\n\n\nMaya was set to transfer to station , but Sullivan came to him and said he wanted all three lieutenants because he felt they each played an important role at the station. ''(\"[[I Fought the Law]]\")''\n\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . A young girl came out of the driver's seat and said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. Once she was freed, Lucas helped Travis and later USAR stabilize the building so it wouldn't collapse. This was complicated when a broken cellphone sparked and explosion fueled by the extra propane tank under the sink in the RV. ''(\"[[Baby Boom]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Ripley was visiting with Sullivan and trying to rekindle their friendship, Station  got a call out for a car accident. Ripley checked the page and recognized the number that called  as Vic's. Because of this, he joined them on their call. After helping the team rescue [[Josh (Station )|Josh]] and [[Emmanuelle]], he took Vic home and tucked her into bed. She was worried because of their fight about her having told Travis and told him that if that small fight was enough to end them, he should take his good-smelling shirt and leave. He said he didn't want to leave and instead climbed into bed with her, even though she was sick. ''(\"[[When It Rains, It Pours!]]\")''\n\n\nDuring a power outage, the generator at station  had a worrying result, so Ripley supervised while Pruitt fixed it and then wrote him a recommendation for the job he was applying for. Ripley noted that Pruitt was way overqualified for the job, but Pruitt said he thought it would be nice to be a big fish in a small pond for a while and get some praise. ''(\"[[The Dark Night]]\")''\n\n\nRipley jumped in to help when a fire at a coffee processing plant got out of control. He oversaw operations outside, but when all other firefighters were trapped leaving the captain of  alone inside, Ripley superseded his order for no one else to come in and went in after him. After getting knocked over by exploding coffee beans, he was able to get [[Ted Conlin|Conlin]] out. Vic, after watching and waiting for him, said she wanted to spend forever with him and proposed that they get married for real, not just as a way to get around the rules as he'd suggested. She told him not to answer right away and they agreed to meet for breakfast the next day in order to talk about them. The next morning, he went to a flower shop to get her flowers and accept her proposal. However, as he left the shop, he collapsed on the sidewalk. ''(\"[[Friendly Fire]]\")'' Ripley was found by [[Levi Schmitt]], whom he'd met in the flower shop, and taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where Bailey recognized him as he was being treated in the ER. Maggie ran several tests, trying to get to the bottom of why he passed out in the street. Eager to see Vic and accept her proposal, he made multiple attempts to get discharged so he could leave. When Maggie left him alone in his room, even after making him promise not to leave, he left the hospital in search of Vic, which was discovered when Maggie got his test results that showed his condition was much worse than previously believed. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nThe tests showed he'd been exposed to some kind of toxin, which could kill him. He was out searching for Vic, but agreed to go to a hospital if they promised to find Vic and bring her to him. Once he was at the hospital, it was confirmed that he'd been exposed to hydrofluoric acid at the coffee plant fire, which was affecting his calcium levels. They started treatment, but Maggie told them it wasn't working and now was the time to say goodbye. His sister and Sullivan talked with him for a while and then Vic went in and sat with him until he died. ''(\"[[Always Ready]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Sullivan overdosed on fentanyl, he saw Ripley, who told him that he had a problem and needed to repair his life from top to bottom. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\n\n\nExes\nHe'd been married twice. First, to an unknown person when they were very young, then to Eva, who disliked his job and made him sleep on the couch regularly only six months into their marriage. ''(\"[[Do a Little Harm...]]\")''\n\n[[Victoria Hughes|Victoria \"Vic\" Hughes]]\nLucas first met Vic during the Captain peer reviews. Vic yelled at him and blamed him for the outcome of the call, saying he wasn't doing his job and making sure all stations were on par with Station  with response times. ''(\"[[Every Second Counts]]\")''\n\nAfter the skyscraper, the two had another confrontation in which Vic blamed him for not caring about her team and evacuating the entire building with her whole team still inside. Even though Lucas told Vic that if she came at him like that again, he'd fire her, he was clearly bothered by what she'd said. ''(\"[[No Recovery]]\")''\n\nThe two reconciled when Vic attended a peer group for firefighters, she was surprised to see Ripley there, sharing how the skyscraper fire affected him. After the group, she apologized to him for how she'd acted that day and its impact on his feelings about the day. ''(\"[[Lost and Found]]\")''\uaDuring the police training session at Station , which Chief Ripley was overseeing, they flirted. After Dean's birthday party, Vic asked him out for a drink and then two of them slept together. The next morning, she snuck out of her own apartment, worried about what it meant, but Lucas called her later that day and they presumably agreed to keep seeing each other. ''(\"[[Last Day on Earth]]\")'' \n\nRipley visited Station  during the storm, and even though he was worried it looked like he was there for her, Vic told him they could be professional while at work. After working together on a call breaking up a tree, Vic and Ripley agreed that what they'd done was hot and hooked up at the station. ''(\"[[Weather the Storm]]\")''\nAfter Ripley announced Maya's promotion to lieutenant and transfer to Station , Maya asked Vic details (since Vic was seeing Mayhorn from ) in front Ripley, who was clearly curious, but Vic quickly shut it down. Later, Lucas tried to find out more from Vic, but they were interrupted by Pruitt. ''(\"[[Crash and Burn]]\")''\n\nFour months after the windstorm, they were still seeing each other. They went to Astro Corner Coffee Shop so they could eat together in public and Lucas asked if they could do more of that because he liked being in public with her.\uaThey then started to have sex in the parking lot, but the manager caught them and asked them not to. ''(\"[[Crash and Burn]]\")''\n\nVic learned that Ripley had told his sister about them and he was surprised she hadn't told anyone. She decided to tell Travis and told Ripley that she'd told her best friend. Not realizing that meant Travis, Ripley said he knew that she had the sense to tell someone away from the station. ''(\"[[I Fought the Law]]\")''\n\nWhen Lucas learned that Vic had told Travis, he was upset and believed she wasn't considering the consequences of other firefighters knowing. The two had an argument in Vic's bunkroom and Vic asked Lucas if their conversation (meaning their relationship) should be over. Lucas left before he could say anything he didn't mean.\ua''(\"[[Baby Boom]]\")''\n\nAfter their fight, Vic was uncertain what their future held. Because she was sick, Sullivan sent her home while Lucas brought burgers to ask Sullivan for advice about Vic. Even though he tried not telling Sully who he was seeing, Sullivan guessed quickly. When the station received a partial  call, Lucas quickly realized it was Vic and joined the team to rescue her. After she treated a couple that had been in a car accident during a storm and delivering their baby, Lucas was checking up on her in the Aid Car, but Vic told him she didn't need him and that she was awesome to which he responded that he knew.\uaLater, Lucas was taking care of Vic at her apartment and Vic confronted him that they hadn't finished their fight and told him he was wrong because if an argument was all it took to break them up, they shouldn't even be together, so if they couldn't fight and make up, he could take his nice-smelling shirt and go. Lucas responded that he didn't want his shirt back and that no matter what, he didn't want to go, \"I don't want to let you go.\" He then got into bed with Vic despite the fact that she was sick. ''(\"[[When It Rains, It Pours!]]\")''\n\nSometime after this, Lucas christened Vic with her nickname, \"Eggy\" because of the dish she ordered for breakfast at the Astro Corner Coffee Shop. The manager of the diner apologized about scolding them when they were about to have sex in the parking lot and said they were relationship goals. He also assumed that Vic and Lucas were married, calling Lucas Vic's hubby. Lucas then told Vic about his previous wives and that if he would get married a third time, he would take it very seriously and he wouldn't be game unless he knew it was really right.\ua''(\"[[Always Ready]]\")'' Around this time, Vic met Jennifer, Lucas' sister, and the two hit it off even when Vic told her about how the two of them jumping out of planes during the weekends\ub\ub\ub\ub\ub\ub\ub.''(\"[[Always Ready]]\")''\n\nWith their first fight out of the way, things settled quite nicely for them. While he was at the station to talk to Sullivan, they took advantage of a brief power loss to make out a little. When discussion Pruitt's recent trip to Hawaii, they discussed going on a trip themselves, but because of the secrecy, they decided that they could only go on trips in their heads. At the end of a difficult day, Vic said she wanted to go on a real vacation with him, but she still acknowledged that they couldn't without telling everyone they were dating, so she dismissed the thought as a mere fantasy. ''(\"[[The Dark Night]]\")''\n\nIn order to be able to stay together without worrying about their different ranks, Ripley suggested they get married, but they dismissed the idea as too crazy. However, after seeing him make a difficult call and go in after the captain of station , she proposed to him for real, saying she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him. He tried to respond, but she told him not to reply right away. They agreed to meet for breakfast the next morning and talk about them. However, the next morning, Ripley didn't show up, which Vic took as a rejection. She didn't know that Ripley had collapsed right after getting her flowers and had to be taken to the hospital. ''(\"[[Friendly Fire]]\")''\n\nWhen Lucas woke up a the hospital, he asked for Vic, but the other firefighters told him they couldn't reach her. While waiting for test results, Lucas checked himself out of Grey Sloan to go look for Vic. When Sullivan called, he said he'd go back to the hospital after he found Vic and explained what had happened. Sullivan then told him he had to go to the hospital urgently because he had inhaled chemicals at the fire, and he agreed to go to a hospital if they would go get Vic and bring her to him. They did so, but by then, his condition\uahad worsened and Jennifer, his sister, believed Vic was at fault for what had happened to her brother and pulled the family card, keeping Vic from knowing anything about Lucas' condition. However, when she learned what really happened and that Vic had proposed marriage, she let Vic in, but by then it was time to say goodbye. Vic struggled with not wanting to go into the room, but ultimately, Travis helped her get there. Lucas accepted her proposal\uaThe couple reunited, albeit briefly. Vic said they could finally take that vacation and described their dream vacation. Lucas then accepted Vic's proposal and asked if they could get someone in the room to get married, but Vic just wanted to have the moment with him, just them. A crying Vic told him she was really ready to spend the rest of her life with him and Lucas said that at least he got to spend the rest of his with her.\uaThey shared a kiss and Vic held his hand until he died.\ua\ub\ub\ub\ub\ub\ub\ub''(\"[[Always Ready]]\")''\n\nAfter he died, Vic was lying on top of the firetruck crying over Lucas as\uashe remembered when they said \"I love you\" for the first time while her team surrounded her.''(\"[[Always Ready]]\")''\n\n\n[[Jennifer Ripley]]\nHe is very close with his sister Jennifer. Their parents died when he was in college and she was still a kid, which brought them even closer. She worried about his job and even more when he took up dangerous hobbies. ''(\"[[Always Ready]]\")''\n\n\nHe and [[Robert Sullivan]] were good friends when they worked at station . Their friendship was strained when Robert's wife died on a call while Ripley was working on her. ''(\"[[Do a Little Harm...]]\")''\n\n\nHe was the Fire Chief for the [[Seattle Fire Department]]. Before deciding on a new Captain, Ripley also acted as interim Captain for Station  for six weeks. He had been with the Seattle Fire Department for over fifteen years when he died.

Marcus witnessed Ted hitting his mother and turned the burners on to fill the house with gas. Then his mother called  to report a gas leak. The firefighters responded to the calls, which happened three times in a single week. During the third call, they became suspicious that something more serious was going on, especially after Jack saw Inara signing to Marcus that daddy had calmed down. Jack separated Marcus and Inara from Ted and used sign language to learn the truth about what was happening, including that Inara didn't have anywhere else to take Marcus. She also said she'd called the police the first time it happened, but Ted convinced them she was overreacting and he'd locked her in a closet for eleven hours that night. Once he knew the truth, Jack helped Dean stall Ted while Inara went inside and packed a bag. Then they lied to Ted and said it was safe for him to stay in the house but not for Marcus and Inara to stay with him. While he was disputing this, they noticed flames in a room in the house. The fire was quickly extinguished and Ted believed that Marcus started it. When the firefighters witnessed him grabbing Marcus and yelling at him, they pulled him away. Jack then took Inara and Marcus to [[Marsha Smith|Marsha's]] house where she welcomed them to stay with her. Knowing that Inara had started the fire when she was inside packing her bag, Jack told her to flush the matches she had, throw away the clothes she was wearing, and scrub herself in the shower. She thanked him for his help. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\")''\n\nHe and his mother continued to live with Marsha. ''(\"[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\")''\n\n\nDuring Covid-, Marcus, Inara, and Marsha isolated at Marsha's place together. Marcus didn't like when they wore the masks because he couldn't read their lips. He also wanted to show Jack his new train set, but Jack couldn't come inside to see it. ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")''\n\nWhen a loose tiger became trapped in the barn at the station, Jack FaceTimed Inara and Marcus so they could see the tiger. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\nJack came over one day before work so Marcus could show Jack his new train from a distance. ''(\"[[We Are Family]]\")''\n\nOne day, while Inara was at work, Marsha collapsed, so Marcus texted Jack, who brought the aid car to pick her up. She was struggling to breath, so they took both her and Marcus to Grey Sloan. She was immediately tested and taken to the COVID unit. Jack and Marcus were also tested immediately and Inara was tested later. Marsha's test came back positive, but the other three tested negative. Jack was upset because Marsha had continuously refused to wear her mask. When Inara got home from work, she was worried that Marsha would die and they'd have to find another place to live. Jack offered to stay in the apartment with them until Marsha was able to come home, to keep them safe from Ted. He ended up sleeping on the couch, while Marcus slept on the floor next to him. ''(\"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\")''\n\nJack came over after his shift one day to help Marcus with his online homework. Jack offered him money for every prime number he could name and Marcus quickly cleared him out. He then ate several grilled cheese sandwiches trying to keep with Jack, then went to take a nap. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\nAfter some time in the hospital, Marsha started feeling better. She video called Inara, Jack, and Marcus asking for gossip and Inara and Jack were surprised to learn that Marcus already knew the two of them had hooked up and both he and Marsha were happy about it. Later, when Jack came home and asked Inara officially to be his girlfriend, Marcus and Marsha both celebrated. ''(\"[[Learning to Fly]]\")''\n\nMarsha's condition continued to improve until she was finally told she'd be able to go home the next day. Jack took the day off and he, Marcus, and Inara planned to come to the hospital to pick her up. However, as they were getting ready to leave, Jack got a call from Emmett telling them not to come as Marsha had taken a turn and they expected her to need to go on a ventilator later that day. Jack hadn't gotten a call as her son was her emergency contact. They were all heartbroken that they wouldn't be able to bring her home, so Maya brought the ladder truck to the hospital and Jack climbed up with Marcus and they held a sign outside Marsha's hospital window telling her to get better soon so Marcus could beat her at Parcheesi. ''(\"[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\")''\n\nInara called Jack when Marcus panicked after seeing a fire truck drive by. He was worried that something would happen to Jack while he was at work. At the advice of Theo Ruiz, whose own father was a firefighter who died in the line of duty, Jack took Marcus on a tour of the station over the phone and explained to him that most of the job wasn't very dangerous at all. This helped reassure Marcus that Jack wasn't going anywhere. ''(\"[[No One is Alone]]\")''\n\nWith Marsha on a ventilator, her son eventually stepped in and used his power of attorney to have them remove it. Marcus was very angry about Marsha dying, so Jack took him to the station gym and had him punch a punching bag as a healthy way of dealing with the anger. He then hugged Jack and cried. When the time came to remove the ventilator, Jack, Inara, and Marcus did a video call with the hospital. Her son was also on the call, but left as soon as the process was initiated. Levi explained to them that there would probably be shallowing of her breathing and it could take minutes or hours. They stayed on the call and talked to her as she breathed. Hours later, while Jack was sharing a memory of Marsha getting a pet bird to talk to, they were surprised to hear Marsha laughing. She had woken up and was breathing well enough on her own. All the firefighters celebrated along with Inara, Jack, and Marcus. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")''\n\nAs her recovery continued, Marsha offered to take Marcus to the park to work on an egg-drop project for school, allowing Jack and Inara their first real time alone together as a couple.

Instead, he sat in the driveway for two hours when the carport collapsed on his car due to the wind storm. Mary finally spotted him and called for help. Station  arrived on foot after trees blocked their way and worked to free Jimmy. Mary was irritated at him for running away instead of helping her deal with his mother, Ruth, whom she felt was undermining her parenting. This was affirmed when they heard her over the radio responding immediately when they cried, instead of letting them cry it out. Mary went back inside for her safety while they continued to try to free Jimmy.\n\nHowever, a spark started a fire in their house. When the team noticed, they jumped into action to rescue the family and put the fire out. Maya had to run back to the truck to get supplies. She sent Ben and Travis in to get Ruth, Mary, and the babies out while Dean and   finished getting Jimmy out. Travis and Ben found Mary trying to go upstairs after the babies, so Travis pulled her out while Ben went upstairs to get the babies. He found Ruth in their nursery holding both of them to her chest. He took the babies from her and told her to follow right behind him. Once the babies were out, Mary and Travis took them to check them over and Ben realized that Ruth hadn't followed him out. Even though Travis warned him to wait for oxygen, Ben took a deep breath and ran back into the house after Ruth. He got to the room, but before he could get her out, the doorway became blocked with flames, trapping them inside. He radioed out with his situation and then waited with Ruth for help.\n\nWhen Maya returned, she and Vic came inside and carried Ruth out with them right after Ben.

Ryan called Maya to let her know and she verified that he was her brother. She was shocked to learn that Mason had been living on the streets.

While waiting outside the building, Natalie collapsed and was taken to the hospital. She coded in the ER, but they were able to resuscitate. When she regained consciousness, she was worried about her son, Max, who has anxiety and likes to know what's coming and what to expect. However, when he came in so she could talk to him, she coded again and had to be rushed into surgery. There was damage to her heart that indicated a recent heart attack that hadn't been treated, likely because she thought it was just heartburn. Maggie placed an LVAD to take the pressure off her heart, but because of the severe damage she saw, she told Natalie's husband, Evan, that it was unlikely that Natalie would ever wake up. Despite this, Evan persistently refused to tell Max that his mom was dying and instead lied to him that everything would be okay. When Evan went to Natalie's room to say goodbye to her, he left Max with Andrew because he didn't want Max to see his mom like that. Andrew took Max up to the roof to talk to him about how sometimes people don't know how to tell other people bad news. He worried Max, who thought it meant that his mom was dead already, and he took off and then left the hospital on his own. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\nThe police were called to track Max down and [[Ryan Tanner]] found him walking alongside the street by himself. He called out to Max, but Max started running and fell into a manhole down into the sewer, where he was swept away. [[SFD Station ]] was called to coordinate a rescue effort. Evan asked to come along and help. They almost had him at one drain pipe, but because of an oxygen tank malfunction, Maya wasn't able to get down the sewer in time. Andy jumped down impulsively, but she wasn't able to get a proper hold on Max and he was swept away again. The last place where they had a chance to catch up to him turned out to have a very small opening, too small for an adult, so they were forced to lower a loop down to Max so he could be pulled up on his own. However, Max refused to trust his father, who had told him to let go of where he was holding and grab the loop. Evan then confessed to Max that his mother was dying and apologized for not telling him before. Max then grabbed the loop and was lifted to safety.

He also put her on a strict diet that wouldn't even allow her to eat a cookie. As such, Maya missed out on the things that most teenagers occupy themselves with, like music and celebrity crushes.\n\nDuring practice, one of her competitors, [[Hima]], approached her and invited her to tag along with the rest of the team for pizza. Maya declined because of her diet. Hima had noticed him at races before and commented he was a bit scary. Maya admitted he was. Hima then invited her to the theatre to watch the latest movie, which Maya accepted. As their friendship grew, Maya developed a crush on her. While Hima was helping her with her trigonometry, she discovered that Maya wouldn't even eat a cookie per her father's imposed diet. Maya knew how it looked but she praised herself lucky for having a dad who put her above everything else, never missing a single race, while other dads were always working or vanished after a divorce. Hima then found out Maya didn't know anything about pop culture. When she asked if Maya had a celebrity crush, Maya replied she had a crush, though not a celebrity one. She then leaned in and kissed Hima.\n\nDuring the next race, Hima twisted her ankle and fell on the track. Maya, who was leading the race, stopped to check on her. Hima urged her to keep going but Maya only managed to get back to second place. Her father was furious with her and told her she had no friends on the track, only competition. That night at the dinner table, he punished her by denying her potatoes. He then went on to ignore Maya completely and turned to Mason, who wasn't used to receiving attention from his father. Mason said he finished third in a mile run and got a piece in the school art show. Their father told him to quit art so he could achieve first place. Maya stood up for him by saying she would come to his art show and reached for the potatoes, but her father grabbed them and threw the bowl into the wall and he told Mason he couldn't hear losers, who are dead to him. His behavior made her put all her attention back into training. She won the next race and as her father congratulated her, she ignored Hima's attempt at high fiving her.<ref>[[Into the Woods]], x (S)</ref>\n[[File:xMayaMedal.png|thumb|Maya's gold medal.]]\nMaya then went on to win a gold medal in the , meter sprint in the  Olympics in London. She did so on a sprained ankle, pushing through the pain like she had been taught.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref><ref>[[House Where Nobody Lives]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nOn her first day at the fire academy, Maya met Andy. Andy tried to tell her they didn't have to be friends because they were the only two women. Maya said there's safety in numbers and they ended up sticking together. When Andy struggled with a hose drill, Maya coached her through it.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy was confused about her feelings, she called Maya and Vic to drink and hang out. They talked on the porch and admitted Ryan's looks when he came over to talk to Andy.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya went with Travis on a medical call. They tended to [[Edith]], who had fallen and dislocated her shoulder, something that had happened before. Maya was shocked that Edith refused pain medication. Travis saw her foot shaking and asked if she had seen a doctor for it, but she said she was fine. Travis told her she needed an adjustable bed and her grandson was supposed to get her one. She said that she hadn't told her grandson about it because she didn't want him to worry.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile on duty, Maya received a call from [[Ryan Tanner|Ryan]], explaining that her brother was in jail for stealing art supplies. When she arrived at the jail, she was surprised to find out that he was unhoused. She explained to Ryan how he took an interest in art but his parents had no attention or investment to give him since it was all put into her Olympic training, and that Maya blamed herself for his drug addiction. Ryan said to her that he would keep Mason at the jail overnight and keep an extra eye on Mason while on patrol, which Maya agreed to.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy responded to a call for an Aid Car at a police stakeout, just in case anyone got hurt. They got bored as they waited in the ambulance, unable to leave. After the lost the video feed and heart gunshots, Andy, worried for Ryan, wanted to go in immediately, but Maya reminded her that they had to wait to be called. Not long after, they were called in and they learned that it was another officer, not Ryan, who had been shot and they took him to the hospital for an x-ray because the bullet had been caught by his vest.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital. At the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she was scared of fire. They decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref> Maya and Travis did fire drills with Vic, exposing her to flames. Maya continued the drills, even when Vic started to panic. Maya tried to coach her through it, but Vic said it wasn't helping and stopped the drills. They later went jogging, which Vic also didn't enjoy, but Maya said it was jogging or the torches.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy took an ambulance out to give hepatitis vaccines to unhoused people. They saw Mason, who declined a vaccine and Maya's help. Despite this, Maya returned to the area to bring Mason supplies, both things she thought he needed and things he thought he needed. When she jogged by the area later, she saw that he'd painted a mural on the wall, but had left the area.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Maya noticed Vic just starting at the flames and stood with her when she said it helped.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station . Maya sang Andy's praises in her interview, including regarding her decision to leave Jack in the Aid Car with Peter. Maya also admitted, when pushed, that Jack overcame Andy's rule breaking to gain a good outcome. She then told Ripley she knew that Jack was a strong candidate. He then told her she was also a good captain candidate and he expected her to throw her hat in the ring to be lieutenant if a spot came up.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. With the fire in the house, the garage started to heat up. They searched for anything they could use to try to free themselves. They found a toolkit, which Karen used to pick the lock on the trunk of the car and retrieve a jack. They tried to use the jack to lift the garage door, but it wouldn't budge. As the temperature climbed, Ryan decided to hot wire the car and try to use it as a battering ram. Jack said it was a bad idea, but Ryan started it anyway. Andy was able to stop him before he moved the car. Jack had the idea to use the motor from the internal door to get access to the house. It didn't work and they started to wear out. When Pruitt arrived and gave Andy a pep talk, she used the last of her energy to think of a plan. She saw the water heater and decided they could use the pilot light to create an explosion. They siphoned gas from the car and rigged the water heater up to explode and propel itself through the garage door. It worked and once they were free, they were all cooled down and rehydrated.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the law firm, Maya and Vic worked with [[Molly]], the fire coordinator for the floor who took her job very seriously. They had her watch the stairwell while they checked the floor. When the evacuation was started, they had to keep the civilians calm as they waited for their turns. They sent the first group down with Molly, but when the fire jumped floors through the windows, the civilians panicked and started running down the stairs, which led to them trampling Molly. Maya, who had intermittent hearing loss from the water heater explosion, didn't hear Vic warn her. Maya and Vic then continued to fight the fire and Vic found that she wasn't afraid anymore.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Vic started to evacuate themselves, but they met up with Andy, who was on her way up to find Jack. Maya decided to stay with Andy so she wouldn't be alone and sent Vic down to find more help. She and Andy then went up to the floor where Jack was. The door was jammed, which Maya worried meant that the other side of the door was so hot it would kill them instantly. Despite this fear, she helped Andy open the door. Once the door was open, they heard Jack's PASS device going off. They followed the noise to a pile of rubble, which was burying Jack. They were able to free Jack and then evacuated the building.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety. Back at the station, Maya was upset with Andy for ruining their first chance to get Max.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Maya was paired with Jack to teach one group, which included [[Elle Kingsley]]. They both flirted with her and spent the whole day trying to outdo each other for her affection. When Sullivan saw them laughing and felt they weren't taking it seriously, he called Maya out on it, which eventually got him sent home for the rest of the shift. At the end of the day, both Jack and Maya got Elle's number. Upon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party on the station's roof with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAt the recommendation of Ripley and Sullivan, Maya applied to be a lieutenant. She didn't tell the rest of the team, but they found out when Ripley commented on it in front of them. She later told Andy she hadn't told them because she worried about awakening the competitive beast inside her.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya was on the Aid Car with Andy. Their first call involved a kid. It should have been a simple call, but the kid ran into a building with a gas leak, so they had to track down the kid and break through a wall. They came back to the station very dirty. After a shower, they tended to [[Greg Tanner]], who came in looking for Pruitt to patch him up after a fight. Andy tended to him instead and called Ryan, who didn't believe Greg when Greg told him he got in the middle of a fight defending a kid and his phone got broken. When she was finished treating Greg, they got called out again, to tend to an injured hiker. With difficulty, they found [[Clark]], who had fallen and had a branch puncturing his leg. After returning from a later call, she and Maya found Greg in an elevator, where he'd passed out. They suspected a cardiac bruise from the fight. They were able to restore sinus rhythm.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died. Four months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy, Dean, and Maya responded to a call about a woman injured in the park. They arrived to see a confused woman on a park bench with a head wound. She couldn't remember anything about herself or how she was injured. While checking her for other injuries, Maya found a picture of a boy in her shoe. They finished checking her out and then dropped her off at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Later, they found her at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] when they were dropping off another patient. Andy went after her and got her to agree to come back to their rig. Maya and Dean went to investigate how she'd ended up there. Dean learned she was a fugitive and the cops wanted them to distract her to give them time to arrive. They learned she was [[Margaret Chen]]. Andy felt there was more going on, so she asked Margaret about it. She stole some money from her work to pay for her son's medical care. She was going to put it all back, but she got caught before she could. He was scheduled for his surgery that day and she wanted to see him before her surgery. They enlisted Ryan's help. They were able to sneak her into the hospital to see her son and then she was arrested and taken to court.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Jack were called out to the transit tunnel for an unknown medical emergency. They arrived to learn that a subway had malfunctioned and multiple passengers were injured in a minor fall. Once they boarded the car, they started treating the injuries, which all seemed minor. One of the injured was [[Will (Crazy Train)|Will]], who didn't want to let Maya check him out, but agreed when Maya asked directly. She examined him and asked about his cough, but his father didn't know how long he'd had it. Will coughed up blood and Maya noticed that he'd been on an international flight. He'd come from Bashran, in the middle east. Maya consulted with Jack and said she believed they were dealing with a contagious illness and needed to go on lockdown. They radioed out for CDC, which confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in Bashran and said they'd be on their way. They also noted that another passenger, [[Neil]], had come in on the same flight. They talked to Will's father and explained the situation and then made an announcement to the whole car. While they were working, Maya told Jack that she believed he had lied about being fine to get back to work. The situation escalated when Neil's condition worsened and he collapsed on the floor. They put in an IV and used lidocaine to restore sinus rhythm. He stabilized, but then Will collapsed. While Maya and Jack were distracted, [[Reese]] tried to leave, but [[Kenneth]], a security guard, used a taser on him, which set off a cardiac episode. He took the heart monitor off Neil and put it on Reese, which revealed ventricular arrhythmia. They didn't have anymore lidocaine to treat him, so Maya went through the Aid Car, asking the passengers to show her any medications they had. While she was working on that, Reese flatlined and Neil stopped breathing. Jack asked the passengers to help and handed out assignments. They were able to stabilize Reese, but realized Will needed blood. Desperate, Jack used Harold as a donor for his own son. After a rough moment, all the patients were stable. The CDC then arrived and set up decontamination so all the passengers could leave. Jack and Maya's tests showed that they weren't infected. After being decontaminated, the two of them went back to Maya's place and had sex in her shower.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. Once she was freed, they stopped her seizures and sent her to the hospital. When a broken cell phone and an extra propane tank caused an explosion, Maya took over caring for an infant that had been surrendered at the station so Sullivan could oversee stabilizing the building. She used him as a sounding board for her romantic and friendship troubles before handing him over to the social worker.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya has an innate competitive nature that results in her wanting to be the best at the station. According to [[Dean Miller|Miller,]] she doesn't do relationships and usually only has exclusive relationships for a few weeks. However, Maya is also described as relentless and caring, and if she cares about someone she cares fully and will do anything for her friends and family.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n[[Charlotte Dearborn]]\nShe had a one-night stand with [[Charlotte Dearborn]] as part of her self-care.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Elle Kingsley]]\nWhile teaching CPR and first aid, Maya flirted with Elle, a police officer. At the end of the day, Maya got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Jack Gibson]]\nMaya and Jack first met on Maya and Andy's first day at Station . Jack\uajokingly asked if he could touch Maya's Olympic Gold Medal for luck, but Maya immediately refused, telling him it wasn't luck but hard work and it proved how much better she was than him. Then, Maya and Andy both agreed that Jack was \"very ew\".<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> Maya was the only person who knew about Jack and Andy's secret relationship, the latter's proposal, and their subsequent breakup. She was often antagonistic towards Jack, making smack talk about him behind his back and she had clearly sided with Andy during the captain's race.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> However, when Andy and Jack got back together, Maya didn't know and was hurt when she found out, thinking Andy had betrayed her, but the girls resolved their differences.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)]], x (S)</ref> Later, at the skyscraper, Maya helped Andy look for Jack.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the skyscraper and the end of Andy and Jack's relationship, Maya and Jack were often seen bickering and throwing light-hearted insults at each other. When Ripley revealed that Maya had applied to be a lieutenant, Jack told her he was ready to take her on if she tried to take his job since there could only be two lieutenants at the station. At the police training, they worked together and competed for the attention of policewoman [[Elle Kingsley]], and eventually both got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> When Pruitt drew everyone's attention to Jack's PTSD, Maya participated in the intervention. However, Jack got angry at everyone and told Maya she had no chance to take his job from him. When the team went to look for Herrera and Sullivan, Pruitt as acting captain benched Jack and ordered Maya to act as temporary lieutenant. Four months after the windstorm, Maya was meeting Jack after every therapy session and showing her support, telling him he would eventually return to active duty. She also invited him to Andy's party, but he declined.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya and Jack were both on Aid Car during the next shift, but Maya didn't think that Jack was ready to be back to work. The two responded to the train crash which turned into an infectious disease call and even though they were arguing in the beginning, they later started working together to treat the patients. Afterwards, while waiting to be cleared, the two resolved their differences and later had sex while showering at Maya's apartment.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref> While Jack wanted to clear things up between them, Maya told him she was telling Andy about what had happened and that nothing would happen between them ever again. However, when Maya tried to tell Andy, they were interrupted by Ryan and his date.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\nLater, Maya noticed that Jack was doing the quiet thing, meaning he was angry and out of concern, she asked what happened. Jack told her that seeing Dean with his family brought up feelings about his own and he told Maya that he didn't actually know who his biological parents were. Maya tried helping him by suggesting he internet-stalk them, but he brushed her off and told her he didn't want her help. However, Maya still cared and she told him so on the rooftop of the station, adding that he was the last person she expected to care about. She then walked away, but turned around and kissed him passionately.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref> The two then continued to hook up in secret. While having beer for breakfast after shift at the houseboat, Miller asked Jack to point out why Maya would make a terrible fake girlfriend for him, but Jack simply complimented Maya, saying that \"her eyes sparkle even in the dark\", proving he also had feelings for her.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy brought up the fact that she and Jack were on good terms, Jack went to Maya and told her they needed to tell Andy, but Maya suggested they have a last secret hookup in a supply closet before telling Andy the truth. However, Andy found them and she and Maya got into a big argument about it as Andy felt humiliated.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> During overhaul at the coffee processing plant, Dean revealed that he knew about Maya and Jack as they often snuck in and out of the houseboat and Maya was eager to talk to someone about all of her feelings as Andy was still mad at her.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref>\ua\n\nAfter Ripley died, Maya was visibly sad and constantly crying and Jack tried to ask her what was going on, but Maya denied the fact that she was crying. Later, Dean used an analogy with sea anemones to explain their behavior to them why Maya was crying and the fact that Jack wasn't actually annoyed with her as well as the fact that the two didn't know how to act now that they were officially together. At the funeral, Maya held Jack's hand during Sullivan's eulogy.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter the bar crash, Maya sat down with Jack and told him he is good in bed and he is a good guy. He caught on to what Maya was intending. He asked if it was because she was interested in getting promoted to captain. She neglected to answer the question. She said they should just be friends.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Nicole|Nikki]]\nWhen Maya met Dean's girlfriend, Nikki, she was surprised that it was one of her exes.<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nCarina met Maya at the [[Emerald City Bar]] where she recognized Maya from when she brought in a patient's nose.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> Carina offered to buy her a drink if she told the story. Maya said she was drinking alone. Carina asked if she was sure, and Maya said she was maybe not sure.<ref>[[Into the Woods]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya called Carina when JJ went into labor at the fire station. They later FaceTimed, and Carina said they could talk about anything and any time Maya wanted.<ref>[[Ice Ice Baby]], x (S)</ref>\n\nCarina came to the station and brought lasagna for Maya because she heard from Ben that Maya had had a rough day. Maya said that all they did was hook up and she didn't need a girlfriend. Carina went to leave but then Maya apologized. Carina closed the door and they started kissing.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter they had sex one day during Carina's lunch break, Maya had a breakdown and said she was the truck that destroyed the family of Station . Carina comforted her.<ref>[[Born to Run]], x (S)</ref>\n\nCarina told Maya to speak her truth in Italian, and then they started kissing.<ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya asked Carina if she wanted to take some days off and go on vacation together. Carina gladly accepted.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOn vacation, Carina and Maya had drinks by the pool when a man named [[Todd (No Days Off)|Todd]] started to flirt with them. Carina commented that men are idiots in Italian. Todd thought she was speaking Spanish and tried to reply. Maya challenged him to a push-up battle and if she won, he would them drinks and leave them alone. He accepted the challenge and quickly lost. Maya ordered another round drinks on Todd's tab and Carina added french fries and mozzarella sticks. They then shared a kiss while the men looked at them in surprise.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya's phone chimed and she found out about the four-alarm fire back in Seattle. Carina assured her that everyone else would respond to the fire and that she couldn't help from , miles away. Maya started to have a panic attack about how she should be there helping. Carina told her that emergencies happen every day and that they all get fixed even without her. She held Maya's face and helped her calm down.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Carina met Maya's mother, she went to comfort Maya because of her mother's statement that what her father did to them was abuse. Carina explained to her that she loved her own father so much it took her a long time to realize that what he did to them, letting them live in fear, wasn't okay. Although Maya kept saying that her father never hit her or her brother, meaning he wasn't abusive. Maya then decided she needed to go for a run to blow off some steam. After she came back, she saw that Carina never left. Carina said she stayed there in case Maya wanted to talk. Maya told her to leave and admitted that she slept with Jack just an hour before she got back.<ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter an encounter with her father that included her father grabbing her ponytail while she was working, Maya cut off her own ponytail in the station bathroom. Jack saw this and told her a sorry could go a long way with Carina. She went to the hospital to apologize to Carina and found her in line at the coffee cart, where she told Carina she was right. Her dad was abusive to her. She apologized to Carina and begged her to get back together. She said she loved Carina. She added that she'd never said that to anyone but her brother, so it was a big deal for her. [[Teddy Altman]], also in line at the coffee cart, encouraged Carina to forgive Maya. Carina said Maya slept with her ex-boyfriend, and did that to hurt Carina. Maya told her she was willing to spend the rest of her life trying to prove to Carina that Maya could be trusted. Teddy said Carina should forgive Maya if she truly loved her. Carina told Maya she loved her too. They made up with a kiss.<ref>[[Louder Than a Bomb]], x (S)</ref> \n\nOnce things settled down, Carina had to go back to Italy because of her expiring visa. Marriage was the only way to stop Carina from going back, so Maya suggested it. Carina stated she wanted kids but didn't want to get married. After a large fight, Carina left for the airport without Maya. In the car, her friend, Gabriella, called her and told her she should not let Maya go, as she'd seen how happy Maya made her, even while she was grieving her brother. As Maya and Andy were discussing the fight, Carina came running back from the car, stating that she would much rather do something she didn't want to do than lose Maya. Then, Carina proposed and Maya happily accepted.<ref>[[Comfortably Numb]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nGrowing up, Maya never saw her father as abusive toward her. She always said that he really cared for her and her career as a runner. Lane Bishop often pushed Maya to be her \"best\" and would punish her if she didn't do well enough. Once she came in first place a track meet, but she didn't beat her time. Her father made her walk home over  miles. The next time she ran, she beat her best time.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x (S)</ref> Her parents put lots of money and attention towards her Olympic dreams, but they often put Maya and her training ahead of her brother, [[Mason Bishop|Mason]].<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter a call which included abusive couple who had a baby, Andy went to go talk to Maya, asking her if it reminded Maya of her father. Maya said no, because her father raged and threw things, but never at people and never in front of the neighbors. Maya talked about how Mason was like their mother and buried his head in the sand. She just wanted to please her father. She made herself a perfect copy of her dad so that he wouldn't find a reason to be mad at her. Over the years, she learned his sighs, the looks, the hunch of his shoulders. She was scared that by protecting herself from him that she was turning into him and she didn't want that. She told Andy she didn't want to be like him. For her thirteenth birthday, she was allowed to have a couple friends over to spend the night. She didn't have three close friends but she invited three softball players from her team to spend the night. They hung out in the basement and did all the typical sleepover things. At that age, Maya knew that she wasn't completely straight, but pretended during the sleepover. One girl, Holly, went to kitchen during the movie and came back with a soda. Maya freaked out because those were her dad's and no one was allowed to touch them. Holly didn't see the problem as it was just a can of soda. A few minutes later, Lane came tearing down the stairs, asking who drank his last soda. He yelled at Holly and took the soda back. Holly called her mom and went home crying. Maya told Andy she woke up that morning to all of Carina's things in the apartment and felt this rage build up inside of her. She was so used to having control over every space in her apartment and was terrified that she would be like her father, that she would snap at Carina. Due to Lane's parenting, Maya was afraid she wouldn't be able to love Carina the way she deserved to be loved. Andy told her that because she didn't want to end up like her father, that she was nothing like him.<ref>[[Don't Look Back in Anger]], x</ref>\n\nThe day of the Maya's and Carina wedding, Maya told Carina that she never told her she was bisexual or even that she was getting married, stating she didn't think they would care or be proud of her. She went to their house and told them she is bisexual, in love with a woman, and getting married to her. She told her mom that she didn't deserve to be cowering behind Lane in the hallway and invited her mom to come live with her and Carina. Lane tries to talk to her, but Maya cut him off and left. Maya's mother came to the wedding alone.<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Andy Herrera]]\nMaya and Andy are best friends and each other's confidant.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref> They met at the fire academy and banded together as they were the only two women in their class and have been best friends ever since.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> However, when Andy snapped at Maya that the Captain's race wasn't her fight, Maya backed off and was cold toward Andy.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref> She continued to ignore Andy, but after realizing you should let the people you love in, she went to find Andy, but was shocked to see Jack's uniform top outside the Captain's bedroom.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref> While on a stakeout together, unable to leave, they started talking and sorted through their issues together.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\uaWhile trapped in a burning garage with no way out, the two worked together to find a way to escape and Andy was worried when Maya was knocked over from the explosion.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref> Maya also helped Andy look for Jack during the skyscraper fire.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\ua\n\nWhen Andy decided she needed to move out of her father's house, Maya supported her and offered to let Andy move in with her.

When Ripley announced that Maya had applied for lieutenant and she would have an interview, Andy was upset Maya hadn't told her. Maya later confessed she hadn't told her because she didn't want her and Andy to get competitive, but Andy told her she wasn't afraid to get competitive with her. Later, when Sullivan took his anger out on Maya during the police training, Andy took Maya's side and yelled at Sullivan.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> The next shift, Andy and Maya worked together on Aid Car and Maya was supportive of Andy who was worried Sullivan would fire her, but Sullivan didn't.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\nDuring the windstorm, Maya was initially rostered on Aid Car,\uabut Andy took her place along with Sullivan so Maya could impress Chief Ripley. When Ripley announced that Maya would be promoted to lieutenant at station , Maya tried to call Andy to tell her the news, but it went to voicemail.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya was worried about Andy when Ripley told the team that she and Sullivan hadn't reached Rainier First Hospital and she drove the firetruck and helped rescue Andy and Sullivan. She attended Andy's Medal of Valor ceremony and later hosted a party at their apartment for the occasion. Maya also teased Andy about having sex with Ryan in her room during the party.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref> When Andy didn't want to give an interview about winning her Medal of Valor, Maya supported her, but told her that she'd lost her \"firegasm\" and the two worked together to help a woman with fake amnesia to see her son before his surgery.

Maya asked Andy if they should talk later, but Andy said they should just focus on Vic. Later at the funeral, Andy and Maya talked and Maya apologized for not telling Andy about Jack and Andy accepted her apology before Maya asked Andy how she was coping with the funeral. After the funeral, while at the bar, Andy and Maya talked about Andy and Jack and Vic. Andy then told Maya that Ryan had thought that she and Sullivan were together. Maya told Andy that she'd seen their moment at the hospital, too, but Andy refused to believe it.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n\n\nMaya is a firefighter at [[SFD Station |Station ]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]].

Ben tried to talk her down, but she refused, even when he said that he couldn't take his hands off the stabbing victim without him dying. Emmett then climbed into the PRT to get the drugs, but tripped, startling Melly, who then fired the gun and hit Jackson in his leg.

Travis helped Michael practice rescuing trapped persons by pretending to be one in a scenario created by Theo to help him study. Michael successfully rescued Travis. By the next year, they were dating secretly. However, when Travis came over to Michael and Theo's place, they learned that Theo knew  and was happy for them. They continued to date until, in , while having dinner with Theo, Travis accidentally referenced their future children. This prompted Michael to pull out a ring to propose. Travis surprised him by producing a ring of his own. They proposed and accepted simultaneously. ''(\"[[No One is Alone]]\")''\n\nWhen they told Travis's parents they were engaged, his parents were silent on the issue and then his father left the table. As they planned the wedding, Travis asked his mother to read a poem she'd written while she was pregnant with Travis at the ceremony. She agreed, but on the day of the wedding, neither of his parents came. Michael promised to be his family and show up for him.\n\nAfter the wedding, Nari read the poem to them privately. Michael said she'd done her best, though Travis said it wasn't enough. ''(\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\")''\n\nWhen Theo came up for a promotion to captain, the three of them celebrated with some champagne. After the promotion went through, Travis worried about Theo being Michael's captain given their friendship. He worried about Theo being responsible for Michael being injured on the job. Michael reassured him that it would be okay. However, some time later, at a scene, Theo miscalculated and told Michael it was safe to shelter in place. It wasn't, and Michael ended up dying. ''(\"[[No One is Alone]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Travis Montgomery]]\nHe was married to [[Travis Montgomery|Travis]] until his death. Neither of Travis's parents was present at their wedding and never publicly accepted their marriage. ''(\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\")'' After their wedding, they honeymooned at a B&B. ''(\"[[Reignited]]\")''\n\nAt some point during their marriage, they won a trip to the Maldives. During the trip, Travis worried about not having much time left on their trip until Michael told him to stop and enjoy himself instead of just worrying about not having enough time left. ''(\"[[No One is Alone]]\")''\n\n\n[[Theo Ruiz]]\nHe and [[Theo Ruiz|Theo]] were best friends until his death, for which Theo was responsible.

Instead of arresting him, he instead told the son to go straight home, knowing that would earn him a favor from the mayor. Instead of going straight home, the son caused an accident which killed a family of five. He spent only a single night in jail before being released. Dixon later cashed in that favor to be named the fire chief. ''(\"[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\")''\n\n\nMichael was chosen to replace the late [[Lucas Ripley]] as fire chief in Seattle. He gave a press release promising good things for Seattle under his leadership. Then he visited Station , where they made bad first impressions by mocking him without knowing he was standing behind him. He declared his intentions to use specifically Maya to generate good press for the fire department. After Station  responded to a fire at a store where a set of fireworks had been set off, he lauded the department's efforts in that case during a press conference. ''(\"[[Indoor Fireworks]]\")''\n\nWhile they were playing ping pong, Ben proposed to Dixon that he sponsor a program to staff ambulances with physicians, bringing the hospital to the public. He rejected Ben's idea and then left to go to a meeting. After watching [[Martin]] die, Ben went back to Dixon and asked him what he had to do to make the physician response team happen. He asked Dixon to give half the money and said he'd get Grey Sloan to make a fellowship to cover the other half. ''(\"[[Eulogy]]\")''\n\n\nDixon was pleased when Maya was named the new captain of station  and supported her when she gave her first big speech to the team. Later, he ran into Pruitt, who was having trouble getting his cancer treatment covered even though the cancer was almost definitely a result of his work as a firefighter. Dixon brushed off Pruitt and his concerns. ''(\"[[House Where Nobody Lives]]\")''\n\n\nDixon came to the station the day the PRT launched, posing for photographs and preparing for the press. He also introduced his son, [[Emmett Dixon]], the newest recruit for station . He asked Sullivan to take it easy on Emmett, because he wasn't a natural talent even though he worked hard. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Dixon learned that station  was responding to [[Kyle Rexton]] holding a knife on a shop owner, he tried to get Maya to back her team off so PD could step in with their negotiator. She refused, saying Sullivan had unique insight because he and the subject were both veterans and her team was handling it. Later, Dixon went back to Maya and told her to get his son off the scene. She refused, saying he's part of her team. Dixon then ordered the SWAT team to approach and said PD would be making the calls once SWAT was in position. Before this could happen, Sullivan peacefully led Kyle out, where he was arrested and the grenade he was holding was neutralized. When they returned to the station, Dixon told Maya that if she put his son in danger again, he'd bury her in desk duty. ''(\"[[Poor Wandering One]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Pruitt lined up boots on the steps of city hall to represent the firefighters who had died of cancer within the last year, Dixon was upset at the display. ''(\"[[Poor Wandering One]]\")''\n\n\nOn Emmett's day off, Dixon planned to have dinner with him and his girlfriend, Alicia, and show her around the station. They had dinner along with Travis, who had come to the station to get his forgotten headphones. At the lunch, Dixon made it clear he intended for Emmett to make lieutenant within six months and asked Travis if he could do it on his own or if he'd have to pull some strings. Travis said a few decades on the job might toughen him up. After a fire in the city was upgraded to a three-alarm, Dixon excused himself to make an appearance at the scene. Later, after it was upgraded again to a level-five, all firefighters in the city were called to the scene. Dixon told the arriving members of station  to stay safe and not get killed because it would be murder on the city's insurance. ''(\"[[No Days Off]]\")''\n\n\nFollowing Pruitt's death, Dixon launched an investigation into Maya and her decision to allow Pruitt to go onto to the roof where he fell to his death. When he arrived at the station, he found Travis posing for a calendar and believed Maya had planned that to garner sympathy. He then invited the whole team to his country club to celebrate his son's engagement to [[Alicia]]. He then proceeded into Maya's office to question her, along with [[Jerry Cooke]]. He asked Maya to go over what had happened and she explained what Pruitt had chosen. When she became emotional speaking about it, he told her to pull herself together and not make him regret endorsing a female captain. She informed him that her emotion was not a weakness but a strength. After the questioning was finished, Maya reminded Dixon that during the same call, Sullivan left his post and entered the building, but he couldn't reprimand him because it would reflect poorly on himself, as he'd appointed Sullivan. She told him he could order her back to work or order her to do whatever and she'd do it. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\")''\n\n\nDixon was annoyed when Sullivan stopped him from going home because he had something to tell him. Thinking it was about Pruitt's funeral, he finally agreed to fund it. Sullivan then confessed that he and Andy were married. He additionally confessed to stealing drugs from the PRT and overdosing while on the job. After hearing his confession, Dixon made it clear to Sullivan that he expected him to keep it to himself. If it got out, he'd have a drug scandal marring his first year as Chief and made it clear he'd turn them over to the feds, risking prison time for Sullivan, Ben, and Bailey, if it got out. As Sullivan left, Dixon told him Sullivan owed him one and he wouldn't forget that. ''(\"[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\")''\n\nIn exchange for keeping quiet about Sullivan's theft and overdose, Dixon tried to push through permits for a friend's new business without inspections. Sullivan decided not to let that happen and went to the Civil Services Commission and confessed to what he had done and detailed Dixon's corruption. ''(\"[[Bad Guy]]\")''\n\n\nDixon came to check in at the scene of a series of explosions at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]]. While Maya was trying to report on what happened, he instead walked away to talk to the press. While he was at the scene, talking to the press, two officers came and informed him they had a warrant for his arrest. They arrested him on charges of fraud and extortion. ''(\"[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\")''\n\nHe revealed at Sullivan's hearing that all charges against him had been dropped. ''(\"[[We Are Family]]\")''\n\n\nDixon was called on to testify at Sullivan's hearing to determine if he would be allowed to continue to be a firefighter. He was quick to shift any blame off himself, claiming he didn't report it immediately because he was holding his own internal investigation. He also insinuated that Sullivan used the fact that Emmett is gay to keep him quiet on the issue. He also implied Sullivan had been using drugs during other calls, including the one where Pruitt Herrera died.\n\nAfter testifying, he told Ben to let Sullivan go down and not go down with him. ''(\"[[We Are Family]]\")''\n\n\nIn the wake of Dean's lawsuit against the Seattle police, Dixon came to the station and told Maya to put a muzzle on Dean if she valued her career and their relationship with the police department. She told him the police department should be the one mending fences, not the fire department. ''(\"[[Here It Comes Again]]\")''\n\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd's death, Dixon appeared on television making a statement on behalf of the police department. He said the police department stood in support of their communities. Then he knelt on camera. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station )|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\nAs the protests continued, Dixon appeared on television again, telling people that protesting was not the way to get their voices heard. ''(\"[[Say Her Name]]\")''\n\n\nOn the first day of Crisis One, Dixon spoke to [[Sean Beckett]] and expressed his excitement over Crisis One, because it meant PD didn't have to respond to \"mental health crap\" anymore. ''(\"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\")''\n\n\nEmmett and Travis came over on Dixon's birthday to have dinner. While they were looking through old photos of Emmett, Dixon shifted the conversation to SFD, which he believed needed more conservativism. Travis challenged him, but they were cut off by Kitty and Emmett calling them for dinner. They ate in awkward silence until Kitty brought up Alicia and her desire to have grandchildren. This led to even more awkwardness, then Dixon talking about his plans to run for mayor and his plan to shut down Crisis One if he were elected. He and Travis argued about it while Kitty tried to get them all to eat cake and Emmett told Travis it wasn't worth it. During this argument, Dixon accused Travis of taking Emmett off his path and making him gay. ''(\"[[Alone in the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nNot long after his birthday, Dixon held a press conference during which he announced his candidacy for mayor. In his speech, he promised to clean up Seattle. That same day, he also visited the scene of a fire, where his friend, [[Mr. Phillips|Mr. Phillips']] building was in flames. When firefighters discovered that there were several women trapped inside the building and Mr. Phillips hadn't said anything about it, they rescued them. Dixon said that the women would have their opportunity to tell their story and so would Mr. Phillips, telling the firefighters not to jump to conclusions. Dixon then spoke privately to Mr. Phillips, assuring him they'd take care of it. ''(\"[[Death and the Maiden]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Kitty Dixon]].\n\n\nHis son, Emmett, was a firefighter. ''(\"[[House Where Nobody Lives]]\")'' He told Sullivan that Emmett is not a natural talent, but he's a hard worker. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\nAfter Emmett came out to him, he refused to speak to him, though he outed him publicly to push his own agenda at Sullivan's hearing. ''(\"[[We Are Family]]\")''\n\n\n[[Gary (Bad Guy)|Gary]]\nHe is friends with Gary. When Gary started a new business, Dixon promised to take care of the permits.

Carina and Ben helped her inside the building and then out to the barn, but the aid car was still out, so they laid Nancy on the floor of the barn. Carina examined her and  determined that the baby was in a breech position. Despite this, Carina was able to coach her through labor. While she gave birth, Wayne collapsed due to cardiac arrest. While Ben tended to him, Carina kept Nancy focused on her labor. She gave birth soon afterward, then delivered the placenta. There was some bleeding, so Carina did fundal massage, which was successful in stopping the bleeding.\n\nBen, Andy, and Dean did CPR at the station and then loaded him in the ambulance. Ben stayed behind to help Carina with Nancy while Andy and Dean took Wayne to the hospital. At the hospital, a nurse told them there weren't any beds, forcing them to continue CPR in the aid car while they waited for a bed to become available.

Nari and her husband were not pleased by this, as they were ashamed that their son was gay. His father wanted them to elope, believing a public wedding was putting them too much on display, but Travis disagreed. Nari agreed to read a poem she'd written at the wedding, but on the day of the wedding, neither she nor her husband showed up. She read the poem to them privately, but Travis said it wasn't enough and it was too late.\n\n\nYears later, when there was a blizzard in Seattle, Nari called Travis at work and told him to eat some soup to stay warm. He quickly ended the call to deal with other problems at the station, but when she called back the next morning, he told her he could use some of that soup. ''(\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the covid- pandemic, Travis delivered groceries and supplies to her house. ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")''\n\nDespite these deliveries, Nari decided to go to the grocery store, telling Travis that if Paul could golf, she could go shopping. She was unaware that he wasn't actually golfing, but meeting up with men for sex. She offered to box up some spicy tofu for him if he wanted to come get some. He later decided to do this. ''(\"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\")''\n\nAfter Paul told her his golfing buddy's wife had tested positive, Nari went with him to the drive-thru testing at the station. When Travis saw them, he had them park and come inside. After getting his mother settled in, he privately questioned his father about his real exposure, knowing it hadn't happened while golfing. Travis then tested both of his parents and sent them home. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")''\n\nAs she was leaving the grocery store one day, a maskless woman blamed her for the pandemic and spat on her. Nari then went out to her car and frantically cleaned herself with a wipe, then cried. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station )|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n\nNari and Paul came to station  on Thanksgiving to share their Thanksgiving meal. As they shared what they were thankful for while setting up the tables, Travis pushed Paul until he finally came out to Nari and confessed his affair. Nari left the room after hearing his confession.\n\nWhen Travis followed her, she said she wished Travis hadn't pushed Paul because she enjoyed their life as it was. She then went to the kitchen where she insisted Jack let her help cook. While they were cooking, Nari smelled smoke and discovered that the turkey was on fire in the oven as someone had set the oven to clean instead of bake. Travis had to use the jaws of life to open the oven to Maya could put out the fire. Luckily, Station  brought over a whole meal including a turkey.\n\n\nIn light of Paul's actions, Nari decided to move out of their shared home. She told him over breakfast, though she admitted he didn't seem to believe she was serious, and began packing her things while he was gone. Travis came over while she was packing and they ended up talking about Nari's decision to side with her husband instead of defending Travis against him when he was a child. Nari ultimately apologized and admitted she was wrong for allowing Paul to treat Travis the way he had.

While waiting outside the building, she collapsed and was taken to the hospital. She coded in the ER, but they were able to resuscitate. When she regained consciousness, she was worried about her son, Max, who has anxiety and likes to know what's coming and what to expect. However, when he came in so she could talk to him, she coded again and had to be rushed into surgery. There was damage to her heart that indicated a recent heart attack that hadn't been treated, likely because she thought it was just heartburn. Maggie placed an LVAD to take the pressure off her heart, but because of the severe damage she saw, she told Natalie's husband, Evan, that it was unlikely that Natalie would ever wake up. Despite this, Evan persistently refused to tell Max that his mom was dying and instead lied to him that everything would be okay. When Evan went to Natalie's room to say goodbye to her, he left Max with Andrew because he didn't want Max to see his mom like that. Andrew took Max up to the roof to talk to him about how sometimes people don't know how to tell other people bad news. He worried Max, who thought it meant that his mom was dead already, and he took off and then left the hospital on his own. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\nThe police were called to track Max down and [[Ryan Tanner]] found him walking alongside the street by himself. He called out to Max, but Max started running and fell into a manhole down into the sewer, where he was swept away. [[SFD Station ]] was called to coordinate a rescue effort. Evan asked to come along and help. They almost had him at one drain pipe, but because of an oxygen tank malfunction, Maya wasn't able to get down the sewer in time. Andy jumped down impulsively, but she wasn't able to get a proper hold on Max and he was swept away again. The last place where they had a chance to catch up to him turned out to have a very small opening, too small for an adult, so they were forced to lower a loop down to Max so he could be pulled up on his own. However, Max refused to trust his father, who had told him to let go of where he was holding and grab the loop. Evan then confessed to Max that his mother was dying and apologized for not telling him before. Max then grabbed the loop and was lifted to safety. Evan then took Max to his mother's hospital room, where he lay with his mom to say goodbye.

In , she was doing a tour of duty in Iraq, where she met and worked alongside [[Robert Sullivan]], a scout sniper. As they waited for their target to appear, they talked, getting to know each other to pass the time. While he dreamed of a simple life after his service, she said she wanted to stay in the military forever. As she said this, their target appeared. Ross ordered the shot, but Sullivan didn't take it because the target's children were present. His hesitation cost them the shot, which upset Ross. Later that night, they got another shot at it. In order to convince him to take the shot, Ross told Sullivan all the things she wanted to do after leaving the military, which she couldn't do until he took the shot. After some hesitation, he fired. After they were extracted, they shared a moment together in a tent and agreed to enjoy each other's company more. The two of them then started kissing. ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\n\nUpon her arrive in Seattle to take on the job of fire chief, Ross learned that her predecessor, [[Fire Chief McCallister]], had left his desk so unorganized it took her days to sort all the paperwork out. Once that was done, she started visiting stations to meet the firefighters serving under her. On \none such day, she visited station  and , introducing herself and meeting them. She then went with station  to a scene, where a car had gone over the side of a cliff. Andy Herrera tried to cede command to Ross, but she said she was just observing and told Andy to keep command. When the call was over, she returned to station  with the team, where she said she'd noted amongst everything else in the derelict paperwork a long-overdue promotion. Overriding Beckett, she then promoted Robert Sullivan to lieutenant of station . ''(\"[[Started from the Bottom]]\")''\n\n\nRoss came to the K fundraiser. After the event was over, she gave a speech about the clinic. Then she flirted with Sullivan while posing for pictures with him. ''(\"[[Searching for the Ghost]]\")''\n\n\nRoss came to station  on the day the clinic first opened. She posed for pictures with Jack and told him it needed to be a success at it was the first thing she approved as Chief. When she overheard Travis struggling to communicate with a patient, [[Jae-Jin Park]], who didn't speak English, she stepped in and asked him in Korean what was wrong, then translated his reply for Travis. She noted that he had edema in his legs like her father had when he had stage  cancer. While they tried to decide what to do next, Jae-Jin's son, [[Justin Park]], came in and explained to them that they knew he had cancer, but hadn't told him because it was inoperable and they wanted to enjoy the time they had left with him and take trips. They knew that if he knew he had cancer, he would hide away from them to avoid feeling like a burden. Ross and Travis watched as Justin led his father out of the station. ''(\"[[In My Tree]]\")''\n\n\nAndy approached Ross and told her that she wanted to be back at , because it was her home and her team. She talked about the problems that  had while she talked, which solved a problem for Ross, as she'd been trying to decide which station to close to balance the budget. ''(\"[[In My Tree]]\")''\n\nAfter a pep talk from Sullivan, Ross visited  on the next shift and told them the station was being closed. She also said they would receive their reassignments or severances within the week. The same day, she met with Maya and told her that she wouldn't be reinstating Maya as captain of , because the department relied on a chain of command to keep people safe and she had ignored a direct order from her superior. Maya tried to defend her decision and told Ross her demotion was more about her supporting her team's involvement in Black Lives Matter than that one call, but Ross shut it down and said it was a problem that she didn't understand that she'd done something wrong.\n\nAfter Beckett refused his offers to help with his alcohol abuse, Sullivan went to Ross and told her that he had a drinking problem. She thanked him for letting her know. ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\nRoss came to the closing of , where she told Andy she was doing everything she could to make sure Andy landed back at , though she couldn't make any promises. From there, she went to , where she told Beckett he'd have to submit to a test of his alcohol level because someone had accused him of drinking, possibly while on the job. She then informed the team that he would be out until further notice and Sullivan would act as captain in his absence. ''(\"[[Alone in the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nIn the aftermath of Andy's arrest, Ross met with her. Since he had to stop by station , she said they could talk in the car on the way. Andy thought she would be receiving her re-assignment, but Ross told her she would be suspended in accordance with department policy to suspend any firefighter charged with a felony. On their way to the , a call came on the radio for a scene involving multiple stations, meaning Ross needed to make an appearance. At the scene, she told Andy she had to stay in the car because she was a civilian.\n\nWhen she learned that the fire was in a sweatshop where twelve undocumented Thai women were being held hostage, she called an immigration lawyer she knew to meet the women at the hospital to help them get S-visas. Travis was frustrated by this, saying it wasn't enough, that not enough was in their purview. She told him either to put himself into a position where he could change things or stop talking about it. Otherwise, his ranting was pointless. When Sullivan tried to speak to her about Beckett, saying him being captain was a flaw in the symptom, she told him she didn't ask him and requested that he not speak to her about any firefighters. If he needed to report something, she told him to go through proper channels. ''(\"[[Death and the Maiden]]\")''\n\n\nIn preparation for a meeting with the board, Ross came to the clinic and took some pictures. She also asked Maya, Carina, and Ben to go over the med station with her so she would be able to talk about the program appropriately. During this time, she was also brusque with Sullivan, brushing off his offer to help. ''(\"[[The Road You Didn't Take]]\")''\n\n\nRoss came to the scene as they were finishing a call involving radioactive material being spilled onto the street near a school bus full of children. While she was checking how the call had gone, Travis said he was going to run for mayor and asked for her support. She said she couldn't endorse him as fire chief, but she would personally. From the scene, she went to the station, where Ben and Bailey were having a party for Pru. Her presence aroused Maya's suspicion, as she knew that Ross and Ben weren't especially close. Maya later left the party to confront Ross and Sullivan, saying she knew they were sleeping together and saying if Ross didn't give her her job back, she was going to report them. When Jack abruptly quit, Ross gave Andy the open lieutenant position at . ''(\"[[Crawl Out Through the Fallout]]\")''\n\n\n\nDuring her time in the Marines, she was involved with [[Robert Sullivan]]. When she became the fire chief for Seattle Fire Department, they rekindled this relationship. ''(\"[[The Little Things You Do Together]]\")''\n\nThe day the clinic opened, Sullivan asked Ross out on a date, but she declined, saying she wanted to lie low for a while so they didn't get discovered. ''(\"[[In My Tree]]\")''\n\nAfter telling Sullivan that he needed to start reporting things through proper channels instead of by texting or calling her, Ross came to Sullivan's place and the two of them had sex. ''(\"[[The Road You Didn't Take]]\")''\n\nThe two of them continued hooking up after this and she came to Pru's party at the station, despite barely knowing Ben. This aroused suspicion from Maya, who confronted Ross and Sullivan at the party, saying she knew they were sleeping together and saying if she didn't get her job back, she would be reporting them.

For the first scenario, she asked Andy and Sullivan to play a married couple with a domestic dispute. She was unaware they were separated. She played the responder in the scenario. When Sullivan had to leave to respond to a call, Theo took his place and the scenario continued. Vic swapped in as the responder, but this ended with her and Theo flirting. Dean suggested he pick the pairings to avoid interpersonal relationships, which Diane agreed to. Next, he had Jack and Maddox play co-workers, the latter of whom had locked himself in the conference room. Dean played the responder. When Maddox got very hammy, Dean accused him of not taking it seriously, so Diane called for them to take a break. For another scenario, Aquino was having a crisis and Ben played the responder and was able to talk him through it. They continued their training and at the end of the day, Diane felt they were prepared to work with the program. ''(\"[[% or Nothing]]\")''\n\n\nA gas main exploded about half a mile from station . After some time at the scene, station  called for backup and station  was sent to help them. After [[Fire Chief McCallister]] joined the scene, command of the scene was shifted to him and Aquino and Beckett began assisting with evacuations. While checking a house, Aquino was blown back when he opened the door to a house full of gas, as Beckett had been unable to warn him in time. He had a penetrating wound to his abdomen, but he was conscious after the explosion. He was loaded onto a gurney and into an aid car. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, he was taken to surgery after x-rays revealed an open-book pelvic fracture along with the penetrating abdominal wound and facial burns.

He and his wife were not pleased by this, as they were ashamed that their son was gay. Paul wanted them to elope, believing a public wedding was putting them too much on display, but Travis disagreed. Nari agreed to read a poem she'd written at the wedding, but on the day of the wedding, neither she nor her husband showed up. She read the poem to them privately, but Travis said it wasn't enough and it was too late. ''(\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the covid- pandemic, Travis delivered groceries and supplies to his parents' house. During this time, Travis was also shocked to find his father on a dating app for men. His profile picture showed Paul wearing nothing but chinos and a belt that Travis had gifted him, captioned with the phrase \"Let me be your daddy.\" ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")''\n\nDespite the pandemic, Paul kept finding men to hook up with. He would tell his wife he was golfing when he was meeting them. His son, realizing what he was doing, confronted him, saying he knew about his profile. Paul denied it and Travis let it go, saying he was too tired to have the conversation. ''(\"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\")''\n\nLater, Paul came to the station to drop off a tin of cookies Nari had made for Travis. He also asked Travis to come over and help them install security on their computer as someone had hacked his Facebook and stolen his picture and he worried where it would end up. Travis knew he was lying to try to save face, but he had to leave on a call, so he simply gave the cookies back to Paul and said maybe they'd help him wash down the shame. ''(\"[[Learning to Fly]]\")''\n\nWhen the wife of man Paul was sleeping with, whom he claimed to Nari was his golfing buddy, tested positive for COVID, Paul and Nari came to the station to get tested for COVID during the COVID testing event. When Travis learned what had happened, he had them come inside, where he questioned his father about his exposure. His father still refused to admit what had really happened. After they were tested, Travis went to see them to their car. After his mom got in, he spoke to his dad about how it made him feel to be rejected when he came out and how much it would have helped him to have his father validate how he was feeling instead of rejecting him. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")''\n\n\nPaul and Nari came to station  for Thanksgiving. Throughout the day, Paul received several messages Travis knew to be from Kyle. Travis deduced that he was planning to meet up with Kyle at some point during the day. While sharing what they were thankful for, Travis made several pointed comments to Paul, leading to him coming out and confessing his affair to Nari, who left the room.\n\nLater, Paul admitted to Travis that he felt free because Nari knew. But he decided not to leave to meet up with Kyle because he loves Nari and wanted to show her that. As they ate dinner, Travis told Paul he knew the pain he was feeling and assured him it would get better. ''(\"[[Little Girl Blue]]\")''\n\n\nPaul came home one day to find that Nari had packed her things and was moving out. The two of them hugged.

Despite the hack, she was in such advanced labor that the hospital had to take her in. She wanted painkillers, but because of the hack, they didn't have access to any of that, so Carina suggested that her partner, Dayna, initiate orgasm to relieve some of her pain. After that suggestion, Peggy refused to listen to her and when the power went out for a minute, Peggy decided to try to leave. However, Arizona examined her and determined the baby was already crowning, so Arizona coached her through pushing and her baby was born. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\n\nDayna had an inconclusive mammogram and was referred to [[Scott Hanson]] for a second opinion. He diagnosed her with stage II breast cancer and started her on chemotherapy. He also promised her she'd get through it. After her second round, she projectile vomited in the car, causing her wife to serve and hit a tree. She was taken to the ER, where they did a CT scan that didn't show any evidence of cancer, raising suspicion. After scheduling a fake appointment where she, too, was diagnosed with cancer, Arizona, along with Owen, decided they needed to stop Hanson. While Owen confronted him and called the police, Arizona showed Dayna and Peggy Dayna's real scans and told her she didn't actually have cancer, which they both celebrated. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\n\nTo express their gratitude, Peggy and Dayna gave Arizona some cookies. They later paged her because they realized they had used peanut butter with marijuana left over from Dayna's chemotherapy. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\n\nPeggy, Dayna, and Rose were out for a walk when Rose started fussing because she didn't want to be in the stroller, so Peggy took her out, but she refused to walk, so Dayna had to carry her. While they were walking, Dayna tripped when Peggy tried to blow Rose's nose, but couldn't break her fall because she was holding Rose, so Peggy reached out to cradle Rose's head so it wouldn't hit the ground, leading to Dayna injuring her face and Peggy her hand. They walked to station , where Carina recognized them, as she'd delivered their daughter. Thanks to the supplies that had arrived for the clinic, Carina and Ben were able to treat them at the station. Because of the location of their injuries, Ben suspected that Peggy had hit Dayna, but this was quickly put to rest when they independently gave the same story of what had happened. After they were treated, they had to fill out of a lot of paperwork, but they were grateful to avoid the ER. Before they left, Carina shared that she and Maya were looking at their options and asked if they'd used anonymous donor.

After Dean's death, she was adopted by [[Ben Warren]] and [[Miranda Bailey]].\n\n\n\nAround eight months after one final hookup before committing to a time of celibacy, JJ came to Dean and told him she was pregnant. ''(\"[[House Where Nobody Lives]]\")''\n\nJJ spent the final weeks of the pregnancy at Dean's houseboat. ''(\"[[Into the Woods]]\")''\n\nDuring a serious blizzard, JJ was at the station with Dean when she went into labor. Maya called Carina, who advised over the phone how to handle the labor, since they were unable to get to the hospital for the delivery. JJ was upset with this, saying she wanted an epidural to handle the pain. Maya told her that Carina had suggested masturbating in order to progress the labor and help with the pain and JJ did so happily. Not long after that, labor progressed and she gave birth. ''(\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\")''\n\nWhen she was less than a week old, she still didn't have a name. Dean and JJ learned they had different ideas of how to parent. After a few days, JJ packed her things and left the baby with Dean, saying she'd never intended to stay and just wanted to give Dean the chance to keep her if he wanted. She told Dean to give her a good name and a good life before leaving. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\nWith JJ gone, Dean struggled to take care of the baby. When Pruitt came over to help, he tried to reassure Dean that he would be okay, but quickly discovered that Dean wasn't sure he was going to keep her. After they spent the day talking, with Pruitt helping with the baby, Dean decided to keep her and named her Pruitt Arike Miller, after Pruitt. Soon after, Vic also moved in and agreed to take shifts with Dean to care for Pru. ''(\"[[Born to Run]]\")''\n\nDuring the Covid- pandemic, her aunt Yemi started living with her and took care of her. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her father died, Andy, who had been staying with them, brought her to the hospital to go with Ben and Bailey, since Ben had agreed to take her if anything happened to Dean. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Ben brought Pru to the station for the station's meal. When he had to go out on a call, he left her with Maya, who struggled as she hadn't spent much time with children. While Maya was watching her, Pru said she needed to potty, so Maya picked her up to take her, but Pru pooped in her diaper before they got anywhere. Carina then came in and took Pru from Maya and changed her diaper and her socks. Pru then spent some time coloring in the barn while the tables were being set up. When her grandfather arrived to take her, Bailey talked him into staying for dinner. He did so, but as soon as dinner was over, he took Pru with him, calling her Arike, which he said was her true name. ''(\"[[Little Girl Blue]]\")''\n\n\nPru remained with her dad's parents while Ben and Bailey explored their legal avenues. Dean's parents remained insistent that she would be living with them. However, one night, when Pru woke up crying for Bailey, they called her and had her help get Pru to sleep. ''(\"[[A House Is Not a Home]]\")''\n\n\nAbout a week before Christmas, Ifeya allowed Bailey to take Pru to the station for a visit. ''(\"[[All I Want for Christmas is You]]\")''\n\nAnna, Pru's nanny, later dropped her off for a visit with Ben and Bailey on the same day they were meeting with Ifeya and Bill to discuss their custody arrangement. She said they'd been held up at a medical appointment and asked her to drop Pru off. When the Millers arrived, they told Ben and Bailey they'd decided to let her live with them, with caveats. They eventually worked things out. ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Bailey took a few vacation days, she returned to work with Pru, but then had to put Pru in daycare when she discovered several surgeries had had to be cancelled or postponed. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\n\nBen and Bailey threw a party for Pru at the station. At the party, Ben gave a speech about how being a dad, especially to Pru, had helped him learn to stop taking so many risks at work. ''(\"[[Crawl Out Through the Fallout]]\")''\n\n\nIn the wake of the surgical residency program being shut down, Pru helped Bailey erase surgeries off the surgical board. Then Bailey quit and she and Pru went home to bake cookies. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nBailey took Pru to the park to have a play date with [[Luna Ashton|Luna]]. ''(\"[[Wasn't Expecting That]]\")''\n\n\nJoey brought Pru to the station for the Halloween open house. She was originally supposed to come as a firefighter, but changed her mind and came as Megan Rapinoe instead. At the party, she saw and hugged Jack. ''(\"[[Demons]]\")'' From there, she went to the hospital to trick or treat there, despite already being tired. Bailey changed her into an Ewok costume and took her around. Afterward, she fell asleep in her stroller as Bailey packed up to go home. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\n\n\nWhen she was less than a week old, her mother left her with her father, saying she couldn't be a good mom. She told Dean to have their daughter look her up when she was a teenager if she wanted.

He only came home when Andy flew to New York and demanded that he come home.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nPruitt responded to the scene when [[Claire Sullivan]] was involved in a car accident. He was upset with [[Lucas Ripley|Ripley]] and [[Robert Sullivan|Sullivan]] for not arriving promptly when their station was the first called out.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nBen joined the station as the newest recruit, while his wife still wasn't on board with his decision. During a training exercise, Ben ran off after finding out that Bailey had had a heart attack. He then called Pruitt to let him know he was quitting his job in order not to cause Bailey more stress. However, Bailey talked to him about doing what makes you happy and convinced him to call his boss back and reverse the decision.<ref>[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Pruitt's team responded to the fire. He sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOnce Pruitt was released from the hospital, Ryan came to pick him up after seeing that Andy was busy with a call. He tried to take Pruitt home, but Pruitt insisted on going to the station instead, where he congratulated the team on a successful rescue and making the news.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFrom there, Ryan took him home, where he checked the news for the fire the team was called to next.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nPruitt told Andy of his intent to find a desk job somewhere. She didn't like the idea because she wanted him at home healing. Despite this, he went behind her back and Jack hired him to work reception at Station .<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Pruitt overheard Travis and Dean talking about Dean trying to get with JJ, Dean decided to go back to Pruitt for advice. Pruitt suggested he just go to JJ if he wanted her. He suggested Dean go get a new incident report from her because hers had been damaged and when Dean pointed out that it hadn't, Pruitt spilled juice on it.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile looking for some paperwork, he saw Jack and Andy in an intense moment and realized they'd been sleeping together.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref> He confronted the two of them and told them they had to tell the team or he would tell them himself.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen brought his wife over to visit and she was surprised to see Pruitt at the station instead of at home. After the team was called out, she talked to him about letting his body heal, but he tried to say that he was better off helping people at the station than sitting at home.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nPruitt got sick at work, which was noticed by Dean Miller, though Pruitt brushed it off when Dean asked about it. Later, he told Dean he'd decided to go home and rest and asked him not to say anything to anyone else about what had happened. Dean agreed. Instead of going home, Pruitt went to the hospital, where he asked them to page Bailey.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nHe asked Bailey to give him medicine to help him get through his work, but she insisted on a full exam first. He decided it wasn't that bad and left the hospital. Later, at the station, Dean and Ben sat Pruitt down and told him they'd both noticed he was sick and knew he needed medical attention. He tried to refuse, but when he nearly collapsed, Andy took him to the hospital, despite his objection that she needed to stay at the station.\n\nAt the hospital, tests showed he wasn't responding to his treatment anymore. Bailey suggested adding a new agent. Pruitt agreed to it. Andy wanted to be there for her father, but he said she didn't have to do that. She revealed to him that she'd promised her mother she'd look out for him. Suddenly, he started crashing. Bailey stabilized him and determined he'd had an allergic reaction to the new agent. Despite this, she wanted to continue the treatment as planned. He told her he wanted his daughter kept up to date and involved in all his treatment from that point on.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nInsistent that his opinion should have weight in the decision of who should run the department, Pruitt was interviewed by Ripley in his hospital room while he received chemo. At the end of the interview, Pruitt said he wouldn't recommend either of them for the Captain position.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Pruitt learned from Vic that Andy and others were trapped in a garage that was heating up, he remembered a time when he'd lost part of his team when a similar thing happened. He came down to the scene and coached Andy to fight and figure out a way out from the inside. It helped and Andy and the others were able to use a water heater to escape. Later, while they were at the bar celebrating, Pruitt confessed that he hadn't backed either Andy or Jack for Captain, which upset Andy.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhile the firefighters battled a skyscraper fire, Pruitt called Ryan because he was having trouble breathing and didn't want to pull an aid car away from the skyscraper. Ryan showed up just after Bailey arrived because she was worried about him having missed his scheduled appointment. They found Pruitt not breathing and pulseless. Bailey started CPR and Ryan went to get his car so they could get him to the hospital.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nPruitt was rushed to the hospital, where he was quickly stabilized. They discovered that a clot was the reason why he couldn't breathe. The chemo had caused the clot, but it was also working on the cancer, meaning that Pruitt might only be a few treatments away from remission.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nPruitt came into the station to do his laundry because his machine was broken. While he was there, he tried to talk to Sullivan about his future at the station, but Sullivan brushed him off and said to enjoy his retirement. While was there, Ben was called about getting information regarding the storm drains in Seattle, because [[Max Forrester]] was trapped and they were trying to rescue him. Pruitt, along with Travis, immediately stepped in to help make calls to get information. With their help, Max was successfully rescued.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSullivan called in Pruitt to help him mend things with the team. Pruitt suggested that Sullivan find the heart of the team and use that person to gain the respect of the others.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm. Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but a call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station with the civilians. They played poker and waited for the team to return. Pruitt noticed that Jack was struggling and didn't seem to be sleeping, so he asked Jack about it, but Jack angrily brushed him off.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile they ate, Pruitt stepped aside with Dean and asked him about Jack. He shared his concern and said it wouldn't resolve on its own. He then called the whole team out on not getting Jack help. With his help, they staged an intervention, which prompted Jack to spew vitriol at them. Ripley interrupted his ranting and said that they weren't grounded anymore and no one had heard from Andy and Sullivan for over an hour. He was called back to headquarters, so he left Pruitt to stand in as interim Captain and they went out to find Andy and Sullivan. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhile Sullivan was out recovering, Pruitt stepped up as Captain. When Sullivan was ready to return, Pruitt said he wasn't ready to step back until he felt Sullivan understood his role as Captain, not only making sure everything was clean and orderly, but in serving the community and looking after his team.

After the house was listed, he got some offers, including an all-cash offer from someone who had a tiny puppy that he turned down because he thinks tiny puppies are weird. He also consulted with Ryan to look into the criminal backgrounds of all the people who had put in offers. He also confessed to Ryan that he felt he'd become too comfortable in the house and he wanted to move forward.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter selling his house, Pruitt started packing things. When he ran across some things of Andy's, he brought them to her at the station, saying Reggie had told him it was easier to get rid of things before the move than to sort them while moving in.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Pruitt slut shames Andy.]]\nAt some point, Pruitt found out that there was something going on between Andy and Sullivan. He came by her and Maya's apartment and yelled at her for sleeping with firefighters in her own station, which he deemed bad for the reputation of female firefighters. She assured him she hadn't slept with Robert but that it wasn't his business if she had. He disagreed and said her decisions reflect on his legacy. She then threw him out but he demanded she respect her father. She then left her own apartment instead. Maya then peaked out of her bedroom and told him it was late.

She returned with the news that it was a scrotal lymphoma. He told her he wouldn't go through chemo again as it made him sicker than the cancer itself last time. She stressed that the cancer was very aggressive and that it would metastasize to his lungs in less than six months, giving him a limited life expectancy. He then pointed out that Bailey was bleeding. Carina came in and found she was having a miscarriage. Pruitt stayed with her to comfort her until Ben arrived. Pruitt went to drink at Joe's bar, where Ben joined him. Pruitt told him his late wife had had a miscarriage before Andy. Ben asked him why he was at the hospital. Pruitt stayed quiet and seconds later, a car crashed into the bar.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Pruitt tries to find a way out.]]\nPruitt, Ben, Jackson, and Nico assessed the situation. Several of Grey Sloan's residents were seriously injured and needed medical attention. With the entrance blocked by debris, Nico and Pruitt unsuccessfully tried the back exit, which was blocked by a truck from the outside. He assisted the doctors in taking care of the residents and the driver and passenger in the car until Station  cleared a way into the bar and freed everyone. Andy was surprised to see him and asked why he was there.

They saw the crew of station  as the walked through toward their own campsite. The next morning, the firefighters were awakened by screams coming from the Burkes' camp. He had been making coffee when a black bear attacked them, tearing off Scott's nose and severing an artery in Rachel's arm. The team put a tourniquet on Rachel's arm, packed Scott's face, and then carried them down to the parking lot, where the ambulance picked them up and took them to the hospital. The nose was later located and taken to the hospital so it could be reattached. ''(\"[[Into the Woods]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, Rachel and Scott both immediately went into surgery. Rachel's brachial artery was repaired and Scott's nose was temporarily attached to his arm, so that his face would have time to heal before it was reattached there. Rachel had to have a second surgery the next day to wash out her wounds to prevent infection. She was told she'd be okay after some rehab. Scott, on the other hand, coded after his surgery due to bleeding in his chest and wasn't able to be resuscitated. Rachel was devastated to learn he'd died and pushed Brian, her secret lover, away.

Captain Herrera was there when Rigo's father passed.

When they responded to a fire at Roger's Five and Dime, he jumped in without waiting for instructions, even as Ben was prepared to give some at the triage area. Later, when they went to celebrate at the bar, Rigo showed up looking for his wife. ''(\"[[Indoor Fireworks]]\")''\n\n\nRigo was on Aid Car with Andy and they responded to a bridal shop, where [[Shauna]] had passed out and hit her head. They suspected carbon monoxide poisoning and tested the air to confirm it. They got Shauna out and her condition improved, but they couldn't take her to the hospital because Andy noticed smoke coming out of a manhole cover. When the rest of station  arrived to help, Rigo was upset to be pulled off aid car to evacuate the street. He saw a manhole cover and decided to pull it off over Jack's orders. Jack pulled him away just in time and then benched him for the rest of the call, saying he couldn't trust Rigo. ''(\"[[Eulogy]]\")''\n\n\nRigo made several remarks during Maya's first day as captain, some indicating his distaste for having a female captain. Despite this, he followed orders and participated in the group workout and drills. ''(\"[[House Where Nobody Lives]]\")''\n\n\nRigo brought his wife on the camping trip Maya had planned to build morale. He was annoyed at the mandated fun. When another couple out camping was attacked by a bear Rigo and the rest of the team stepped in to help. Rigo was suspicious when he saw Jack and Eva emerge from the woods at the same time, but didn't confront them on it because of the attack. He later helped carry [[Rachel Burke]] down out of the woods to the parking lot so she could be taken to the hospital. ''(\"[[Into the Woods]]\")''\n\n\nAt some point, he went on a call with Andy where they had to save a woman, [[Kelly (Station )|Kelly]], who was choking in her backyard. When they arrived, Andy was quickly dibbled when she noticed a raccoon nearby and started freaking out. Rigo took over and did the Heimlich on Kelly, saving her life. Back in the Aid Car, he and Andy laughed about what had happened. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Rigo learned that Jack had slept with Eva, things became very tense between them. It came to a head during the blizzard when Rigo beat up Jack. Because of this, the rest of the team learned that Jack had slept with Eva, something they considered a huge betrayal. ''(\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\")''\n\nMaya decided not to fire Jack because of what he'd done, but called the two of them into their office to apologize and assure her they could work together. Rigo was unable to apologize to Jack, but apologized to Maya for not waiting until he was off the clock to beat Jack up. They went out on a call soon afterward and while working together to put out some small fires in a food truck lot, Jack tried to stop Rigo from approaching a tank of liquid oxygen. Rigo ignored him and when Jack tried to pull him back, he dropped a fire extinguisher, which sparked an explosion that eviscerated Rigo. Ben stepped in from the PRT to operate on Rigo's abdomen and save his life. He was able to use REBOA to stabilize him and then he was driven to the hospital. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\nEva was told he was stable after his surgery and he was later able to come off the ventilator. ''(\"[[Born to Run]]\")'' Because he was responsible for Rigo's accident, [[Griffin Ford]] offered to cover all his medical expenses. ''(\"[[Life on Mars?]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of his discharge out of the hospital, Rigo threw a pulmonary embolism and died. ''(\"[[Poor Wandering One]]\", \"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Pruitt's death, Andy dreamed that Rigo told her he never had a dad, especially one like hers. He also told Jack he wasn't a bad guy. Andy was confused as to why Jack was in her dream because he wasn't dead. He then told her they were all orphans. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\")''\n\n\nOn Halloween, Jack hallucinated Rigo throughout the day. He imagined Rigo taunting him over his relationship with Eva and then Rigo telling him he wasn't at fault for Rigo's death. He also told Jack that he deserved love and happiness. When Jack went to the station to see Pru, Rigo nodded at him.

When he was , he learned that his grandfather had been a Nazi during WWII. His grandfather tried to justify his actions, and it quickly became clear to Robert that his grandfather's only regret was that Robert found out. He told Andy and Pruitt that he lived in that house for another six years, but that day was the last time he ever talked to his grandfather again.

He was angered when Andy impulsively jumped into the drain against his orders and told her to be silent for the rest of the call. They reached the final place where they could possibly find Max and found it to be a much smaller entrance than they expected. Andy suggested using the jackhammer to open it up, but they learned there was a gas line near it, which made it too risky.

When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSeeing that the whole team was good, but at the same things, Sullivan decided to assign each of them a specialty to learn. He assigned Dean to water rescue, Maya to incident operations, Vic to crisis management, Jack to tactical force training, Ben to hazmat training, Travis to urban rescue, and Andy to recruitment. He later explained to Andy, who disliked her assignment, that he picked her to do recruitment because she's the most passionate about the job and that shows when she talks to people about it.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSullivan oversaw a training given by station  firefighters for police officers on the anniversary of his wife's death. During the training, he saw Maya and Jack joking around and called Maya out for making it a joke. They went back to the training, but when he felt she wasn't taking it seriously, he called her out again until Andy defended her. Ripley then put a stop to it and told Robert to go home for the rest of the shift.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nIn order to mend things with his team, Sullivan enlisted the help of Pruitt, who suggested he find the person who's the heart of the team and get their help with the rest of the team. Sullivan took this to be Andy and asked her to sit with him sometime when they weren't working and help him earn the team's respect.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSullivan took Pruitt's advice and approached Andy for help. They got a coffee and she suggested that he join them for meals and share about his life to bond with the team.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nDuring the windstorm, the team was called in when B shift became stranded. At the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Sullivan and Andy went on the first call out. They went to the scene, where they found a car that had been hit by another car that then drove off. Unbeknownst to Andy, it was on the same stretch of road where Sullivan's wife had died. In the car, they found [[Shannon (Weather the Storm)|Shannon]], who said she was trying to escape the storm when she was hit. Her leg was broken, so they splinted it, but because of the high winds, they had difficulty wrapping her leg, so they moved her into the Aid Car. As they worked, Shannon asked if one of them could get her purse out of her car, as it had a necklace her grandmother gave her. Sullivan retrieved it for her. They were able to stabilize her leg, but the radios weren't working because of the storm, so they were unable to get advice from dispatch on where to take her and Sullivan wanted to wait for the all clear before leaving. However, when they noticed the wind was starting to move the Aid Car, they knew they needed to get out of there. They tried, but the Aid Car was blown off the edge of a cliff.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAndy and Sullivan woke up in the aid car. Shannon was also awake, but Sullivan was trapped under the collapsed dashboard. Andy got him freed and he planned to go for help, but he wasn't able to move or feel his legs. Andy got him on a backboard and tried to reassure him as she treated both him and Shannon. She then put out a small fire on the Aid Car to keep them safer. Andy stayed in the back with them and continued to monitor them. Shannon coded, but Andy was able to resuscitate. After she was in sinus rhythm again, Andy decided she needed to leave the Aid Car to set off the flares. Only one was still viable, so she took it and left the rig. She made the difficult climb up and set out the flare. While Andy was on her way back, Shannon coded again. Despite risk of paralysis, Sullivan unstrapped himself from the backboard and tried to reach the defibrillator. When he couldn't, he attempted a precordial thump. When Andy returned, she started compressions, but she was unable to resuscitate and Shannon died. Soon after, they were found and rescued by the team.\n\nFour months later, he was still recovering and could only walk with the help of a cane. He left rehab for an hour to attend the party celebrating Andy's Medal of Valor.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter months of rehab, Sullivan was finally ready to go back to work. He met with Pruitt, who had acted as interim captain, and received reports from Pruitt. Pruitt criticized him for missing Jack's PTSD and not seeing that regular drop-ins weren't coming in anymore. This inspired Sullivan to take Ben and Jack for a wellness check on a drop-in Pruitt specifically mentioned. They went to his house and did an exam. He revealed that Sullivan was the reason he stopped checking in. His car was busted, leaving him unable to pick up his medications. Ben then heard regurgitation in his heart. He didn't want to go to the hospital, but he collapsed trying to fight them off. Sullivan distracted him with a game of chess as they worked to get him stable while they waited for an aid car. He stabilized, then checkmated Sullivan. After they sent him to the hospital, they remembered that he mentioned his car wasn't working, so they went to his garage and fixed it.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen, Dean, and Travis had planned to work together to repaint Travis's place. As they prepared to leave, Sullivan talked his way into an invitation to join them. With Sullivan there, they painted in virtual silence. When Sullivan started dancing while painting, they were disturbed, but he explained that when a month ago, you couldn't move your legs, you dance when a song comes on that makes you want to dance. The rest of them started to dance as well.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. While they worked on her, Andy took Ellie to the conference room to talk to her and keep her calm. As her mom was ready to be moved, she said she didn't want to go to the hospital with her because she felt she was always messing things up. Shortly afterward, she collapsed from low blood sugar. She was given glucose and quickly woke up, but still worried about her mom having another seizure and her not being able to help. Andy then sent Ellie to the hospital to be with her mom, while they dealt with the damage to the station caused by the crash and subsequent explosion.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen Ripley passed out on a sidewalk and was taken to the hospital, Sullivan, Ben, and Andy came to the hospital to check on his condition. Andy and Ben were surprised to learn that he'd been buying flowers for Vic when he passed out. After being banished from his room, they waited in the hospital waiting area. They were shocked when his lab results came back, showing his condition was much worse than previously believed and he had fled the hospital in search of Vic.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter the ambulance accident, and his leg injury, Dr. Koracick informed him that he was going to have chronic pain. He refused surgery because it had a / chance of working and was $,. So he convinced Koracick to prescribe one more dose of opioids.<ref>[[Eulogy]], x (S)</ref> While Ben was checking the meds for the aid car, Sullivan offered to help. While he was checking the Fentanyl doses, he hides two in his pocket. Shortly after taking a dose, Robert became a little hyper. He told Ben that he was in the Marines which Ben didn't know. He also told him that he speaks six languages and listed them. He later fell asleep in his office. \n\n\n\n\n\n[[Claire Sullivan]]\nRobert was happily married until his wife\us death. She was involved in a car accident. Robert and Lucas were the first responders at the scene of her accident, but despite their efforts, she died. Since then, he changed into a completely different person and continues to blame himself for his wife\us death for being unable to save her.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> Their first date was to a roller rink, because she loved roller skating.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Andy Herrera]]\n\nWhen they first met, Robert and Andy weren't on the best of terms, but two near-death experiences brought them together; surviving the Aid Car tumbling off a cliff<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x</ref>, and a wave of fire in California.<ref name=\":\" /> When they finally gave into the attraction between them, Sullivan suddenly stopped, which upset Andy, who didn't know he stopped because his leg had gone numb.<ref name=\":\">[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref> After a little back and forth, they finally got together and told Pruitt they were a couple over lunch. They remained in a secret relationship and even got married in a small ceremony with only Pruitt attending, as his cancer was back and he was dying. After his death, falling through a roof he was venting, Sullivan took care of his wife while she grieved her father. He told her that both his parents were dead, and Andy replied that \"we're all we have\".<ref>[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]], x</ref> When Andy returned to work and Ben confronted Sullivan about the stolen drugs from the PRT car, Sullivan was forced to confess to both Ben and Dixon about his marriage. Later that night, they confessed their relationship at a party at the station, much to the surprise of their co-workers.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], x</ref> \n\nUnfortunately, they separated for a while due to Sullivan\us status at a recovering addict. Amelia Shepherd suggested they take a -day break to help with his sobriety. Both Sullivan and Andy found it difficult to be apart, and almost slipped up more than once. Andy almost didn't attend Robert's court case regarding him stealing drugs from the PRT.<ref name=\":\">[[We Are Family]], x</ref> After a discussion with his sponsor, Richard Webber, he decided to reconnect with his wife. He and Andy are seen dancing to music in the beanery and share a kiss. Later, they have sex on the floor of Sullivan's old office, which doesn't seem to bother him at all.<ref>[[Out of Control]], x</ref>\n\nWhen both Sullivan and Dean are arrested after rescuing two girls from inside a man's house<ref>[[Out of Control]], x</ref>, Andy is devastated. When Sullivan emerges from the police station, Andy can be seen running to hug her husband.<ref>[[Train in Vain]], x</ref> During grief counselling, Andy mentions how she fell in love with a Black man, and that she \"takes on the pain he [Sullivan] doesn\ut allow himself to feel.\ud<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station )]], x</ref> \n\n\nRobert's parents were not part of his life very often. They worked a lot, which left him with his grandpa for the most part. He was close with his grandfather until he learned that his grandfather was a Nazi. After he found that out, he never spoke to his grandfather again. His parents both died when he was sixteen in a plane crash.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\n[[Lucas Ripley]]\nRobert has known Lucas for years since his earlier years as a firefighter. They were best friends until the death of his wife, which Robert blamed on Lucas.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nLater they worked to reconcile with one another. When Lucas was on his deathbed, Robert offered to visit with him first, when Vic wasn't brave enough. Robert didn't want to say goodbye, so instead told him \"we're good\"<ref>[[Always Ready]]</ref>\n\n\n[[Maya Bishop]]\nUpon his appointment as Captain, Sullivan immediately indicated to Maya that he expected her to submit an application for lieutenant. When she said she had, he said he looked forward to reviewing it.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nLater, at a [[Storage Unit Fire|fire at a storage unit]], Robert went against Captain Bishop's request for him to stay behind and take in charge outside the storage unit fire. He continued to put on his gear and did not answer her, going against protocol to go inside alone and save his wife.\n\n\nWhen he first became a firefighter, he had no desire to rise up in the ranks. He told Ripley that he did not want to sit around and push papers all day and wanted to be where the action was, saving lives. This changed when his wife died in a car accident. He was a lieutenant in Montana for while until Ripley persuaded him to move back to Seattle and become captain of Station .\n\nRobert was a Battalion Chief for the [[Seattle Fire Department]]. He oversaw about five fire stations, including [[SFD Station ]]. However after he overdosed on fentanyl and had a court case regarding whether or not he should be allowed to continue working for the SFD, he was demoted back to his original firefighter rank.<ref name=\":\" />\n\nAfter his demotion, he became eager to get back to where he was. He undermined Andy often as he was not used to being just a firefighter who wasn't in charge. He also questioned Maya a lot. After the news of the drug use, his team didn't trust him for a while. They tried to mask it by pretending to joke with him and calling him a probie. After Maya broke protocol, he attempted to save the house by going to the SFD board to plead for her. However, this led to Maya being demoted. This caused tension between him and the other members of Station . When his old Marine buddy became the new fire chief, she promoted him to lieutenant. He asked her not to as he finally regained the trust of his team. However, she said that she wanted to change the ways. The old fire chief had his people and she wanted her people.\n\nIn the past, he was an instructor at the West Seattle Fire Academy. He moved to Montana to be a Captain after he lost his wife in Seattle. When he moved back to Seattle, he was appointed as the new captain of [[SFD Station |Station ]], replacing [[Pruitt Herrera]] when it was decided none of the Lieutenants would get the job.\n\n\n*He was a Marine who was stationed in Iraq. He is afraid of Belgian Malinois because they used that breed over there and he saw them do unspeakable things to other people.<ref>[[Ice Ice Baby]], x (S)</ref>\n*He speaks  different languages: English, Spanish, French, Italian, Farsi, and German.<ref>[[Into the Woods]], x (S)</ref>\n*German is his first language <ref>[[Satellite of Love]], x (S)</ref>\n*He wasn't born in Seattle, but has lived there most of his adult life.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n*One of his first assignments was incident operations.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n*He considers making smoothies to be a hobby.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n*He was a scout sniper while stationed in Iraq.<ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n*He can salsa dance.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], x (S)</ref>\n*His grandfather was a Nazi.<ref>[[No Days Off]], x (S)</ref>\n*He was his high school's valedictorian.<ref>[[We Are Family]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nSxRobertSullivan.png\nSxRobertSullivan.png\nSxRobertSullivan.png\nSxRobertSullivan.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Robert-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life:\n*[[Do a Little Harm...]]\n*[[Poor Wandering One]]\n*[[No Days Off]]\n*[[We Are Family]]\n\n\n\n\n{{Robert Sullivan Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Robert Sullivan]]\n[[es:Robert Sullivan]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sullivan, Robert}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:Firefighters]]\n[[Category:S Rescuees]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Despite this, she continued to live her life as a boy into adulthood, when she finally decided she wanted to live her life as her true self and be happy.\n\n\nRosalind went with her brother, Ben, after their father died to spread his ashes at a place where they frequently camped together, at his request.\n\n\nAfter his ashes were spread, Rosalind and Ben raced back up a hill. At the top of the hill, Rosalind was winded and eventually collapsed. She was rushed to the ER, where she refused to cooperate with the doctors, insisting that she was fine despite evidence to the contrary. A test revealed an enlarged spleen, which had to be removed, so [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] scheduled surgery to do that, but Meredith was also concerned about Rosalind's hormones levels because she appeared male, but had the hormone levels of a young woman. She eventually admitted that she was starting to take hormones to live life as a woman.\n\nWhile waiting for her surgery, Rosalind started to cough up blood from a bleeding esophagus, which was caused by the off-shelf hormones she'd been taking. She was rushed into surgery to repair the bleeding and remove her spleen. After her surgery, her brother continued to reject her as a woman, asking why she didn't tell him sooner, as they've been close since they were kids. She tried to explain, but Ben stormed out.\n\n[[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] brought [[Jackson Avery]] in for a plastics consult. Jackson introduced himself and asked for her name, saying he didn't figure she was sticking with Curtis. She told him she had chosen Rosalind and Jackson asked if he could call her that and then explained to her the steps for a healthy transition, saying the off-shelf hormones were done and anything she puts into her body is approved and regulated by the hospital from now on. And he also told her it was time to start seeing a therapist again. ''(\"[[The Great Pretender]]\")''\n\n\nWhen an earthquake struck Seattle, Ben was initially reluctant to call his sister because they still hadn't spoken after she came out to him. However, after spending the day working with [[Jackson Avery]], Ben called Rosalind, who had a bookshelf fall at her home, but was okay. ''(\"[[I Feel the Earth Move]]\")''\n\n\nAt the start of the COVID- pandemic, Rosalind came to live at her brother's house to watch their sons while Ben and Bailey both quarantined due to their work. Both boys enjoyed this change and wanted Rosalind to continue to stay with them. Rosalind brought them down to the hospital one evening to clap for the healthcare workers at the hospital along with the firefighters of station . ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")'' ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")'' \n\nWhen Bailey's mother died, Rosalind was there when Ben broke the news to Tuck. She helped Ben to understand that him lashing out at Ben wasn't personal and was merely an artifact of his grief. She encouraged Ben to help him process his grief and talk about his feelings, unlike how he had dealt with his grief when his own mother died when he was a little older than Tuck. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd, protests cropped around the country, including many in Seattle. Joey and Tuck asked Ben if they could join the protests, saying they wanted to march for themselves and for Rosalind. Rosalind said she'd take the lead from Ben.

The hospital had been hacked, meaning they didn't have access to the painkillers she wanted and she didn't react well when Carina suggested that Dayna stimulate her to climax to relieve her pain. As her labor progressed, she tried to leave the hospital, only to be stopped and told she was crowning. They had her lean over a gurney in the hospital, where she pushed and Rose was born. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\n\nRose returned to the hospital with her moms when they were in a car accident. Dayna had had her second chemotherapy session after being fraudulently diagnosed with cancer and vomited in the car, causing Peggy to swerve and hit a tree. The airbags except Dayna's all deployed, so Rose was uninjured.

Once she was out, she refused to talk, so Dayna carried her.

Instead, he sat in the driveway for two hours when the carport collapsed on his car due to the wind storm. His wife, Mary, finally spotted him and called for help. Station  arrived on foot after trees blocked their way and worked to free Jimmy. Mary was irritated at him for running away instead of helping her deal with his mother, Ruth, whom she felt was undermining her parenting. This was affirmed when they heard her over the radio responding immediately when they cried, instead of letting them cry it out. Mary went back inside for her safety while they continued to try to free Jimmy.\n\nHowever, a spark started a fire in their house. When the team noticed, they jumped into action to rescue the family and put the fire out. Maya had to run back to the truck to get supplies. She sent Ben and Travis in to get Ruth, Mary, and the babies out while Dean and   finished getting Jimmy out. Travis and Ben found Mary trying to go upstairs after the babies, so Travis pulled her out while Ben went upstairs to get the babies. He found Ruth in their nursery holding both of them to her chest. He took the babies from her and told her to follow right behind him. Once the babies were out, Mary and Travis took them to check them over and Ben realized that Ruth hadn't followed him out. Even though Travis warned him to wait for oxygen, Ben took a deep breath and ran back into the house after Ruth. He got to the room, but before he could get her out, the doorway became blocked with flames, trapping them inside. He radioed out with his situation and then waited with Ruth for help.\n\nWhen Maya returned, she and Vic came inside and carried Ruth out with them right after Ben. Then they were able to focus on putting the house fire out. When Ruth was brought over, Jimmy was concerned about her, but Mary pushed him back, saying Ruth needed air and not to aggravate her.\n\n\n\nShe and her daughter-in-law often butted heads over care of her grandchildren.

He was given one phone call and used it to call Pruitt, who came to bail him out and understood why he hadn't called his father instead.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nRyan responded to a call about an apartment fire. When he responded, he parked his squad car in front of a fire hydrant, so when the SFD responded, Andy used the fire engine to push it out of the way, angering Ryan. When Pruitt collapsed during the fire and Andy started crying worried about him, Ryan was able to get her to calm down. Later, Ryan came over to check on Andy and they had sex.\n\nThe next day, Ryan, [[Jack Gibson|Jack]], and [[Andy Herrera|Andy]] freed [[Becca]], who was trapped between two buildings. He also told Andy they didn't have to talk about the sex and they were good.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nRyan was the police response to a fire alarm pulled at Stratford Middle School.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy was working on an overturned tanker, Ryan went to pick up Pruitt to take him home, but Pruitt insisted on going to the station instead.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nRyan then took Pruitt home. After he dropped Pruitt off, he was summarily dismissed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen he arrested Maya's brother, Mason, for shoplifting art supplies, he called her to see him. Maya later opened up to Ryan about how Mason got shafted by their parents because he wasn't the prospect that she was. He agreed to keep an eye out for Mason while he was doing his patrols.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nRyan and the other officers helped the SWAT team with a raid to take down a drug dealer. Maya and Andy provided an Aid Car backup just in case anyone got hurt. When an officer was shot, they called in the car after the arrests had been made.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy had to go through The Incinerator, Ryan gave her a good luck charm they'd passed back and forth as kids. At the end of the day, she returned it and told him it hadn't gone well.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen the police and fire departments had to work together for a disaster-preparedness drill, Jack developed a plan. Ryan didn't like the plan and saw many issues with it.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. The police department was called to respond. Ryan rushed in to help evacuate, despite not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Ryan and Jack shook hands and each agreed the other had done good work.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nRyan and [[Karen Reis]] responded to a  call from [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]], who complained that his wife, [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]], had started a fire to burn his stuff. After Station  arrived to deal with the fire, Ryan, Karen, Audrey, and some of the firefighters ended up trapped in the garage due to Audrey's advanced security system. With the fire in the house, the garage started to heat up. They searched for anything they could use to try to free themselves. They found a toolkit, which Karen used to pick the lock on the trunk of the car and retrieve a jack. They tried to use the jack to lift the garage door, but it wouldn't budge. As the temperature climbed, Ryan decided to hot wire the car and try to use it as a battering ram. Jack said it was a bad idea, but Ryan started it anyway. Andy was able to stop him before he moved the car. Jack had the idea to use the motor from the internal door to get access to the house. It didn't work and they started to wear out. When Pruitt arrived and gave Andy a pep talk, she used the last of her energy to think of a plan. She saw the water heater and decided they could use the pilot light to create an explosion. They siphoned gas from the car and rigged the water heater up to explode and propel itself through the garage door. It worked and once they were free, they were all cooled down and rehydrated.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nRyan and other cops went over to the skyscraper fire and stepped in to help out. He was eventually sent out by Ripley, who didn't want anyone in the building for too long. He went from there to Station  to pick up Pruitt, who was having trouble breathing. He found Bailey there, also looking for Pruitt. They found Pruitt not breathing and pulseless. Bailey started CPR and Ryan drove his car as close in as he could to get Pruitt out.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nRyan and Bailey got Pruitt to the hospital, where she immediately started tending to him. He was quickly stabilized. A clot had gotten to his heart, which is why he was having trouble breathing. Ryan also learned that this was a good thing. The chemo caused the clot, but it was also working on the cancer. He was only a few treatments away from remission.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Max Forrester]] disappeared from Grey Sloan Memorial, Ryan and the SMPD were called out to find him. Ryan and [[Brit Logue]] spotted Max walking along the street and called out to him. This spooked Max, who then ran into a storm drain and got swept away. Ryan called it in as a Search and Rescue. He then helped the firefighters' efforts to find and recover Max.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nIn order to foster cooperation between the fire department and police department, Sullivan sent Jack on a ride-along with Ryan. Ryan told Jack he wasn't allowed to leave the squad car for any reason because he was a civilian. They were on traffic duty. They first pulled over [[Vince (Home To Hold Onto)|Vince]], who was speeding to get home because he had burned himself on hot coffee and wasn't wearing pants or underwear. Jack used the megaphone to ask Vince about his burn and then advised him that he'd need medical attention and offered a police escort to the hospital. After that was complete, Ryan pulled over [[Gregory Dougal]], who was also speeding. He said he was on the way to a birthday party with his daughter, [[Lindy Dougal|Lindy]]. Ryan said he'd be right back and went back to the squad car. He immediately radioed in to say he suspected a child abduction. Jack was shocked that Ryan had figured that out based just on the traffic stop. Ryan pointed out what he'd seen and confirmed that there was an Amber alert out for Lindy, who was the subject of a custody dispute. They waited for backup, but when Gregory clearly became restless, Ryan went over to the car and calmly told him not to do what he was planning because it wouldn't end well for him. He was able to talk Gregory into surrendering. Jack sat with Lindy until her mom came. The mom thanked him, even though he tried to tell her that Ryan was actually the hero. When Jack told Ryan about that, he said he's used to it because cops aren't seen as the heroes like firefighters are.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAt a bust, Ryan noticed a familiar cigar burning on the poker table. He then went to find his father, Greg, whom he suspected was nearby. He found Greg hiding and Greg, surprised to see him, immediately said he'd give them whatever information he had in order to make a deal. Ryan said they weren't after him and he'd just have to give a statement. After giving his statement, he asked Ryan for a ride. Ryan tried to decline, but ended up taking Greg to his next call, where he left Greg in the back seat while he interviewed someone who claimed to have been robbed. Greg told Ryan that the guy hadn't been robbed and explained why. Ryan then revealed he knew the whole time, because Greg had taught him to think like a criminal his whole life. At the end of the day, Greg told Ryan that he wanted to grow a relationship with Ryan, but Ryan said he didn't need one or want one.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Ryan ended up in Andy and Vic's group. Andy showed him how to do compressions and set him up on a dummy, telling him to do compressions until it beeped back to life. He did many compressions, before stopping and saying the dummy must be broken because Andy wouldn't let him stop.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nHis father said he wanted to meet with Ryan and Ryan asked Andy to meet with him. They met at a coffee shop, but after  minutes, his dad hadn't shown up, so Ryan decided to leave because he said he was tired of waiting for his father. Later, Greg showed up at the station injured looking for Pruitt. He told Ryan and Andy that he got in the middle of a fight when he tried to help a kid and his phone was broken. Ryan didn't believe him. <ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile at Friendsgiving with his father, Ryan found out there was a warrant for Greg's arrest. The FBI was involved in the case as well. He went to Pruitt with the information, but Pruitt said he wouldn't tell anyone if he just wanted to enjoy the day with his father. When the firefighters were called away due to the windstorm, Greg had the idea for the rest of them to bring Friendsgiving to the station. While they waited for the others to return, they played cards and reminisced. At the end of the day, Ryan went to Greg and showed him the warrant. Then he said he could arrest Greg and take him in or Greg could leave, no questions asked, but Ryan would never see him again.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nGreg told Ryan to turn him in and Ryan agreed, but said they were still grounded because of the storm, so they went back to the party. Ryan kept putting off arresting Greg, even as Greg told him to do it.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nFour months later, Ryan attended the ceremony where Andy was awarded a medal of valor. When she ran out of the room abruptly without a word, he knew she felt guilty and didn't feel she deserved an award. Later that day, at the party celebrating Andy's medal, the two of them had sex.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nRyan was surprised when he saw Greg, as Greg was supposed to disappear. He gave Ryan the key to a storage locker, saying he wants him to have it. Ryan then went to [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]], where [[Margaret Chen]] was waiting to be arrested after escaping custody. Margaret asked Andy for just a few minutes to say goodbye to her son, who was having surgery and worried he'd die without getting to see her again. Ryan agreed and took her inside to see her son. Then he arrested her and brought her out of the hospital. He then went to the storage locker, where he found a large amount of money, which Greg swore was clean. He told Ryan to use it for the mortgage.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen Pruitt put his house on the market, he immediately started getting offers. He enlisted Ryan's help to look into all the potential buyers' criminal histories. He also confessed to Ryan that he felt he'd become too comfortable in the house and he wanted to move forward.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAt the scene of a call, Maya asked him if he would be over later for a booty call with Andy. As there was some awkward chatter, with Ryan saying that wasn't sure yet, Maya stressed that booty calls could be just that. After Maya walked off, Ryan told Andy he might be over but she said she might be busy that night. That night, as the women headed to a bar, they ran into Ryan, who introduced his colleague [[Jenna Matson]] to Andy as his friend.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBefore work, Ryan sought out Ben at the station to inquire about getting EMT-certified like Jenna. Since Ben was swamped, he directed Ryan to Andy. At work, Jenna told Ryan that she was free after shift. As he expressed interest in a second date, Pruitt came bursting in to talk to Ryan about Andy, whom Pruitt assumed had come to Ryan to talk about her catching her father with [[Reggie]]. Ryan said he hadn't had any contact with Andy at all recently. While out at a scene, Jenna questioned if Ryan's long history with Andy was what made him hesitant to go on another date with her. She made it clear her invitation for the date didn't stand if Andy was still a thing for him. He told her she wasn't. He then approached Andy, who was surprised that he finally wanted to get his EMT-certificate per Jenna's suggestion despite Andy having told him to get it about a hundred times before. Ryan told Andy that they had to stop sleeping together since he was going on a second date with Jenna. She understood and wished him good luck. Ryan and Jenna went to have dinner at a restaurant and they had a nice time.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref>\n\nRyan and Jenna responded to a call of kid gone missing in his building in the middle of a black-out. They met up with the crew from Station . Per [[Kathleen Noonan|Kathleen's]] suggestion, the police officers each paired up with a firefighter to search the building. Jack picked Ryan, who feared things would get tense between Andy and Jenna. Andy and Jenna found the kid stuck in the industrial washer in the basement. Ryan and Jack fetched the extraction tools. Ryan then aided in the building's evacuation. After the call, Kathleen and Ryan joined the crew for drinks. Ryan was surprised to see that Andy and Kathleen actually got along really well. Jack wished him good luck with that.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAt a scene, Andy overheard how Ryan defended her father when his new EMT colleague was disrespectful to him. Andy later thanked him for that.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter a coffee plant fire, Station  responded to a call about a civilian climbing up on a cell tower. Ryan met the crew at the scene. Vic climbed the tower to talk the civilian into coming down with her. On the ground, Andy arrived to inform Vic that [[Lucas Ripley]] had been exposed to a potent toxin at the coffee plant fire. While Ryan thought it was too perilous to switch Vic out, Robert overruled him and the crew enacted the switch. After Andy successfully got the woman down, Ryan joined the firefighters at the hospital, where they all waited outside as Vic spent time with Ripley in his dying moments. While they were waiting, Ryan noticed how Andy held Robert's hand to comfort him. Ryan immediately figured out that Andy had feelings for him. He asked Maya how long that had been going on but Maya told him it was new to her too.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWith a wildfire raging in Los Angeles, Ryan dropped off supplies at the station as a contribution to the Seattle Fire Department's efforts to support LAFD. He informed Andy that the day after Ripley's funeral, he would move to San Diego for a few months with Jenna as they had both been accepted into a tactical paramedic program. She told him she was happy for him and he replied he was happy for her and Sullivan, too, having seen them holding hands after Ripley's death. She claimed there was nothing going on and left for a call on the aid car. After the funeral, Ryan hung out at the wake with the firefighters. He complimented Robert on his moving eulogy and they played shuffleboard together.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref> \n\nOn the morning of his departure, Ryan called Pruitt to come collect Travis from jail after his bar brawl with [[Jeremy Heffington]]. Pruitt took advantage of his leaving to hitch a ride for Travis and himself to Los Angeles, following the crew of Station , which had been deployed to aid in battling the wildfires. As they neared the city, Ryan confessed being anxious over approaching a wildfire with all his possessions in his car. As Ryan said he'd be gone for a while if the training went well, Pruitt grunted, which Travis translated to Pruitt telling him he would miss him. The three of them arrived at the basecamp and found out that Station  was isolated in a neighborhood. While looking for their badges, Pruitt found Ryan's bag with the money he had been given by his father. He advised Ryan not to let his father's bad decisions ruin his life and throw the money away, figuring he would be arrested if he used it. Ryan aided in saving the crew by boasting the communication system, which he had read up in preparation for his training. With Andy safe back at the tent, she said goodbye to him, wondering what life would be like without having him around the corner. He pointed out she had moved on a while ago. She told him to be safe, after which he left. Once he was by himself, he went to burn the money but decided against it at the last moment, taking it with him to San Diego.<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAt one point, Pruitt paid Ryan a surprise visit to tell him something. Over drinks and Pruitt's medical marijuana, Pruitt revealed that he had cancer and that he was not going to have chemo, because chances were it wouldn't work and he didn't want to die while sick from the chemo. They laughed about it while high. Later, Pruitt said that he was going to die soon and he needed for Ryan to take care of Andy since Ryan would be the only one she would have left. Ryan agreed to his request. Pruitt said he couldn't tell Andy yet because she would harass him for not getting chemo. Ryan reminded Pruitt that he had a girlfriend and Andy had her own romantic issues going on. Pruitt told Ryan to always the girl how he felt so he wouldn't end up with regrets.<ref>[[Eulogy]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Ryan returns to Seattle.]]\nTwo weeks later, Ryan showed up on Andy's doorstep as a surprise but his welcome was cut short when a neighbor started screaming. He and Andy ran over to the apartment. [[Milo (Indoor Fireworks)|Milo]] let them in and they found his mother, [[Ruby (Indoor Fireworks)|Ruby]], bleeding in the kitchen whilst holding her baby. Ruby had cut her wrist on a broken wine glass while doing the dishes. While Andy had her lie down, Ryan took the baby and tried to reach  but they kept putting him on hold. Ruby was also afraid she couldn't afford the ambulance ride. Andy then had Ryan call her father, whom she assured Ruby would keep it off the books. Pruitt and his partner came to fetch Ruby. Ryan distracted Milo by playing cops and robbers with him. Ryan assured Pruitt he was staying out of trouble and they agreed to meet up for beers later. Ryan and Andy stayed behind in the apartment to watch the kids when Pruitt took Ruby to the hospital. Once they were gone, Ryan asked about her fight with her father.

After listening to Elena's explanation for why she left, Andy left, telling Elena to have Sandra call her, as she'd tried to maintain a relationship with Andy while Elena hadn't.

They updated her on their lives and their extended family's lives. They also told Andy that they'd mildly stalked her throughout her life, attending her fire academy graduation and salsa competitions. They hadn't kept in touch because the last time they saw each other, Michelle had told Andy about seeing her mom after Andy believed her mother was dead. Over the course of the day, the family caught up and expressed regrets for how things had gone. At the end of the day, they decided they needed to continue to meet up.

Despite this change in leadership, Maya reflexively tried to act as captain on multiple occasions, which irritated Beckett. About ten months after this change, station  worked the Phoenix Fair, handing out water and providing cooling shelter for anyone who needed it to avoid overheating. As they worked, he was condescending to Maya and made sexist remarks about her.\n\nWhen [[Will]], who was high on mushrooms, climbed into the fire engine and drove off in a misguided attempt to get his injured friend help, Maya pointed out that Beckett had failed to secure it when they arrived to avoid that. Shortly after he took off, Will drove into an intersection, where the engine was t-boned by a delivery van and tipped on its side, blocking traffic on all sides. The firefighters immediately stepped in to free Will, which required them to remove the windshield. When Andy came over to help them, she noticed that the engine was leaking fuel out into the road. However, Beckett said they couldn't deal with that as the foam required to neutralize it was on the engine. After they had pulled Will out of the engine to safety, Beckett ordered Maya and Andy to climb the engine to retrieve the foam, which was in a compartment that was jammed shut. As they worked to get it, a parade, which included fire jugglers, approached. Sullivan tried to get them to stop, but one of the jugglers dropped his torch, igniting the fuel and forcing Andy and Maya to jump to safety. They then watched helplessly as the engine went up in flames. The other members of station  arrived soon after and Andy helped them put the fire out. The team was upset by the loss of their engine, but back at the station, Beckett called them to line up and told them it was a win because there was no loss of life and they should celebrate that. ''(\"[[Phoenix from the Flame]]\")''\n\n\nStation  was called out to a house fire. When they arrived, Beckett sent Travis, Jack, and Sullivan into the basement to get water on the fire while Ben and Maya went to cut a ventilation hole above it. When Travis, Jack, and Sullivan stopped responding on the radio, Ben and Maya went to them and found them passed out on the floor. Ben and Maya soon passed out themselves, just as Sullivan was waking up. Sullivan got them out one at a time. Station  arrived as backup and Beckett ordered a surround and drown to put out the fire. He also said anyone who'd been inside the house needed to go to the hospital to be cleared before going home.\n\nThe next morning, Beckett came to [[Emerald City Bar]] to celebrate the call with his team, but met Andy Herrera outside and ended up leaving with her instead. ''(\"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\")''\n\n\nAs a historic heat wave swept through Seattle, Beckett prepared the team for the push-in for their new engine. He assigned Maya to speak at the public debut, with the reasoning that it would prove they \"have girls here.\" When Maya gave a quick speech, he rushed her along and people started to surround the engine to push it in. However, the first few people to touch the engine burned their hands as the engine's metal had warmed significantly in the heat. They quickly cancelled the push-in and brought everyone inside the firehouse, where they began treating people for overheating and dehydration.\n\nLater, station  responded to a call where three cars were crashed together after the head caused the road to swell and break. Beckett oversaw as the trapped passengers were extracted from their vehicles and taken to the hospital for evaluation. When a call came asking if the Crisis One personnel were available, Beckett said they weren't as he said the car accident was an all hands situation. ''(\"[[Too Darn Hot]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to expand Crisis One to the entire SFD, Dean arranged for Diane to train them all in conflict resolution and how to deal with a variety of scenarios they might see. For the first scenario, she asked Andy and Sullivan to play a married couple with a domestic dispute. She was unaware they were separated. She played the responder in the scenario. When Sullivan had to leave to respond to a call, Theo took his place and the scenario continued. Vic swapped in as the responder, but this ended with her and Theo flirting. Dean suggested he pick the pairings to avoid interpersonal relationships, which Diane agreed to. Next, he had Jack and Maddox play co-workers, the latter of whom had locked himself in the conference room. Dean played the responder. When Maddox got very hammy, Dean accused him of not taking it seriously, so Diane called for them to take a break. For another scenario, Aquino was having a crisis and Ben played the responder and was able to talk him through it. They continued their training and at the end of the day, Diane felt they were prepared to work with the program. ''(\"[[% or Nothing]]\")''\n\n\nShortly after an explosion shook station , they were called to a nearby street where there was ruin. Beckett sent the team to set up triage and begin evacuation while he spoke with [[Larry (Season )|Larry]], a landscaper who was digging when he hit the gas main and caused the explosion. Since the gas was still flowing and feeding the fires, Beckett called for backup, which station  provided. Once some houses were evacuated, they started fighting the fires. Vic was spraying a house from above using the ladder when she was electrocuted by a downed power line. Dean rushed up to her and was able to get her breathing again. Sullivan then asked Beckett if he could try shutting off the valve to cut the gas supply as emergency response wouldn't be able to get there for a while. Beckett initially refused, but when Maya assured him they could do it safely, he let them try, but warned them not to use any heroics. They reported back that the valve had signs of corrosion, so the risk might still be present. By that point, [[Fire Chief McCallister]] had arrived and Beckett handed over command of the scene and joined the evacuation efforts. As they approached a house at the front, Dean warned that the house might be full of gas. Beckett tried to warn Aquino, but he wasn't fast enough and an explosion threw them all back, seriously injuring Aquino and killing Dean. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station )|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Beckett stayed mostly away from the rest of the team. When he came into the beanery after a small fire set off the sprinklers, he slipped and fell on the water.\n\nLater, while the rest of the station shared their thanksgiving meal, Andy brought him a piece of pie and asked why he wasn't joining them. He told her he didn't want to intrude on their thing and said if he'd died in the explosion, the only people who would have cared were the other firefighters, but they would have been too busy mourning the guy they actually liked. He then asked Andy again to take her out for a drink. She said things were still messy with Sullivan and it wasn't a good idea. ''(\"[[Little Girl Blue]]\")''\n\nAt the end of a shift, which included fighting a large house fire, Beckett awkwardly told Maya, Ben, and Travis that he understood they were missing some of their friends and he hoped they would return soon. ''(\"[[A House Is Not a Home]]\")''\n\n\nWhen station  responded to a call to find [[Terrence Tillerman]] trapped between two vehicles in his driveway, Beckett supervised as they assessed Terrence's condition and then stabilized the vehicles so they wouldn't move. When Ben determined that Terrence would die before they could get him to the hospital once they moved the car pinning him, Ben asked Beckett to see if the new fire chief would authorize them to use the PRT, as it was the only way to save his life. He made some calls and finally got use of the PRT authorized after Ben had already called Andy to bring it. Once it arrived, Carina helped prepare it and then they moved the car and freed Terrence. Once he was stabilized in the PRT, they took him to the hospital. Bailey later informed the team that he had lived. ''(\"[[All I Want for Christmas is You]]\")''\n\n\nAfter settling in, [[Natasha Ross]], the new fire chief, came to visit station . She met some of the firefighters and then told Beckett that she'd been brought in to right some wrongs. She told him he'd evaded demotion a few times. She said that was fine because she believed in second chances, but advised him he'd already gotten his. She decided to stay at  for the day, accompanying them out on a call, where Andy Herrera took charge as they retrieved a car that had gone over a cliff. During this call, Ben defied Beckett and Andy's orders to go down alone to the car where Owen was trapped. When they returned to the station, Beckett ordered Ben to desk duty until he'd completed three sessions of therapy with [[Diane Lewis]]. He then watched as Ross promoted Sullivan, a promotion she said was long overdue. ''(\"[[Started from the Bottom]]\")''\n\n\nBeckett accompanied his team to a call at a house known to local kids as the Hackett Murder house, where it was rumored that the mother killed her own children. Despite Sullivan suggesting they get USAR to stabilize the house before entry, Beckett sent his team in to retrieve two lost filmmakers, [[Tobias]] and [[Cory]]. When Maya and Sullivan brought Tobias out, they radioed for Theo and Travis, but got no response. Beckett was unaware they were not reachable by radio. [[Hattie]], who had called them in, told them there was a trap door in the house. Maya and Sullivan searched and found it. Maya then used her axe to break it open and they rescued Travis and Theo, plus Cory, who had also become trapped in there. Back at the station, while Beckett was sleeping, Sullivan came into his office and found a bottle of alcohol hidden in his files. ''(\"[[Searching for the Ghost]]\")''\n\n\nWhile leaving a liquor store after buying a large amount of alcohol, Sean ran into [[Natasha Ross]] and [[Robert Sullivan]], who were on a date. Later, after a call, Sean suggested he and Sullivan established a truce because neither of them could prove the other was doing anything wrong. ''(\"[[The Little Things You Do Together]]\")''\n\nOn the day the Dean Miller Memorial Clinic opened, Beckett gave a lackluster speech to start the day before moving to his office. Sullivan found him in the beanery and told him about an AA meeting at a nearby church. When Beckett refused, Sullivan later went to Beckett's office and shared his own overdose experience, which he called the lowest point of his addiction. ''(\"[[In My Tree]]\")''\n\nWhen Beckett didn't come to the AA meeting, Sullivan asked him about it and Beckett said he was going to go to the meeting, but then he got drunk instead. That shift, station  was called to a fire at a candy factory. Beckett gave orders when they arrived and got a map of the factory from an employee named [[Ricky (Season )|Ricky]], which he used to guide the firefighters to cut power to the factory. When they couldn't find the generator using his directors, Ricky told Maya that he was reading the map upside down. Maya told Beckett this and he redirected the firefighters inside. Finally, everyone was evacuated and the fire was extinguished. ''(\"[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]]\")''\n\nAfter Sullivan reported his alcoholism to Ross, she and [[Captain Henderson]], a representative from the Professional Standards Unit, came to station  to ask him about some recent calls, such as the gas main explosion, the [[Phoenix Fair]], and the candy factory fire, and test him to see if he had been drinking that day. She then told him about the accusations against him and said he'd have to submit a urine sample. He was then ordered to go home until the results came out. He said he was happy to give the urine, but said he'd wait in his office instead of going home. Ross said he wouldn't be allowed to leave, even to go on calls. His team went on one call without him, to a parking garage fire. When they returned, he told them his test had come back clear, but he was angry that someone had reported him. He ordered his entire team to run intervals until someone confessed to being behind the accusation, despite it being past midnight and then not having eaten their dinner. They ran until Vic vomited and Sullivan admitted that he was the one who had reported him. Beckett then sent them all to shower. ''(\"[[Alone in the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Beckett learned that Maya, Vic, and Sullivan had taken the aid car to find and treat [[Jeremy Benanti]], whom Andy had punched in self-defense after he assaulted her, he joined them at the scene and told them they needed to wait for backup as they shouldn't treat him. Because his condition was critical, they defied his order and once they got a pulse back on Jeremy, they took him to the hospital, where he died despite their best efforts.\n\nWhen two detectives came to the station to talk to Andy, he said that two other officers had already spoken to her. However, he then realized they were not from SVU and were instead homicide detectives investigating Andy as a suspect. When they became aggressive with Andy, she said any additional questions could be directed at her lawyer. Beckett then ordered him out of the station, saying if they wanted to talk to the paramedics, they could make a formal request to the department.\n\nThe next morning, Beckett told Sullivan he was planing to target Sullivan for his insubordination and warned Sullivan to be prepared. ''(\"[[When the Party's Over]]\")''\n\n\nBeckett led his team to the scene of a building fire. After their arrival, he talked to [[Captain Khalidi]], whose team was already on the scene. Khalidi told him they needed help with search and rescue, so Beckett sent his team in for that. When Travis told him that the inside of the building looked like a sweatshop and [[Pablo]], a security guard they'd rescued from inside, had stopped talking when the building owner approached, Beckett forced the owner to step away so they could talk to Pablo without him hearing. Pablo told them there was a hidden room on the second floor where some women were trapped. He guided them to the room and they rescued twelve women with his help. This sparked an argument between the firefighters, [[Michael Dixon]], and the owner of the building as to what happened. When the fire was extinguished, Khalidi thanked Beckett for his help and Beckett said it was all Travis. ''(\"[[Death and the Maiden]]\")''\n\n\nDuring a clinic day, Beckett talked to Ross. The cleared the air over the accusation that he'd been drinking on the job and bonded over their shared dislike of [[Michael Dixon]]. ''(\"[[The Road You Didn't Take]]\")''\n\n\nStation  got called out to a scene where a truck driver transporting cesium- crashed and the cesium spilled out onto the road. A school bus was also involved in the crash. Beckett had his team use dosimeters to mark the safe zone while they waited for HAZMAT. Before HAZMAT arrived, the driver of the truck decided that since he was already exposed, he would clean up the cesium and move it far enough away that they could get the children out of the bus. During this call, Beckett struggled to remain focused and as they rode back to the station, he told Sullivan he was going to get sober and might need some rehab to help with that. ''(\"[[Crawl Out Through the Fallout]]\")''\n\n\n\nEx-Wife\nHe is divorced. ''(\"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\")'' His ex-wife lives in Florida. ''(\"[[Little Girl Blue]]\")''\n\n[[Andy Herrera]]\nHe met Andy outside [[Emerald City Bar]] following a difficult call. They flirted for a few minutes before leaving together and having sex.

They had to do a fasciotomy to relieve the pressure in the back of the car. Then they waited for dispatch to say it was safe to go somewhere.

They discussed every call any of them made, as the call progressed from trapped civilians to a fire. When they heard over the radio that several firefighters became trapped in the storage facility and were running out of air, Pruitt abruptly got up and left. They continued to listen to the radio and heard that Pruitt was going up to ventilate the roof, knowing that once he did, he would fall into the fire. Lawrence told Irwin to prepare to sound the  bells. Irwin pointed out that Pruitt was retired, but Lawrence countered that dying ventilating a roof sure sounds like firefighting. Irwin sounded the bells.

She called Snuffy to ask him about this, but he advised her to stop looking into it and let her father rest in peace.

He is in a relationship with [[Victoria Hughes]].\n\n\n\nTheo and Michael went to the fire academy together, where they quickly became friends. When Michael began dating Travis, they also became friends. After finishing the fire academy, they began working at station  together. Theo was present when Michael and Travis became engaged. When a captain position opened up, Theo happily announced that he was in the running for it. He eventually got the promoted. He served as captain of station  until he mistakenly told Michael it was safe to shelter in place, leading to Michael's death. After this incident, he asked to be demoted to lieutenant and he moved to station .<ref>[[No One is Alone]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter two weeks of spotting each other on their morning run in Bremerton Park, Theo got into a friendly race to the park entrance with Vic. When they'd both arrived, with Vic slightly ahead, they acknowledged that they'd both been jogging there a lot lately. When they each removed their masks at a distance, they realized they knew each other from fighting a fire together. Vic was put off when he mentioned being from station , but they said they'd see each other tomorrow.\n\nThe next morning, Theo smiled when he saw Vic jogging by him and started running after her.<ref>[[Don't Look Back in Anger]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTheo and Vic met again when Vic went to Kaminski's, her parents' restaurant, to get celebratory pierogis after a three-alarm fire. Theo hadn't been there as his shift started after the fire was put out. He asked her out on a date, but she turned him down, saying she wasn't dating due to the pandemic.<ref>[[Out of Control]], x</ref>\n\nHe told all his Instagram followers to try Kaminski's, saying they have the best pierogis in town.<ref>[[Train in Vain]], x</ref>\n\nAnother day, Theo met Vic in the park again. He saw that she was upset and asked if she'd had a rough shift. She told him she actually hadn't started yet. He told her he'd seen the video of Sullivan and Dean being arrested and they talked about that for a while. She said she was usually the one to find the good in the bad, but she couldn't this time, which he understood. He reached his hand across the back of the bench where they were sitting and let their fingers brush together lightly.\n\nLater, Vic called Theo to try to set up a date between them, but was disappointed to learn he was on his way to meet up with someone. She was surprised when only a few moments later, he appeared at the station door with flowers for her. She asked when his next COVID test was and he said Tuesday, the same as hers, so they agreed to meet up on Wednesday.<ref>[[Learning to Fly]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile they were on their date, Theo got a call asking him to sub at  the next day. Vic asked him not to tell anyone there they were seeing each other and he agreed. The next day, they pretended not to know each other, but Travis recognized Theo as the captain who had gotten Michael killed. Because of this, Vic told Theo they couldn't see each other anymore, believing that Theo had really done something wrong as she knew Travis and didn't believe he could be so wrong about anything so important. However, she later comforted Theo when he said that the day Michael died didn't just haunt Travis. She was hugging him when Travis walked in.<ref>[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis was angry that Vic was comforting him and realized Theo was the firefighter Vic had met in the park. This led to a fight between Travis and Vic that lasted for several days.<ref>[[No One is Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter parting ways, Vic and Theo ran into each other as he left her parents' restaurant. He asked if it was okay that he kept eating there and she said it was.<ref>[[Here It Comes Again]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nWhen [[Kaminski's]] was set on fire, Theo went in to retrieve Vic's parents, carrying out a crock pot when her mother refused to leave without it. Later, once the fire was out, he came back from a fire down the street to help with overhaul. He brought bottles of water and helped Travis board up windows. While they boarded up windows, Theo apologized and Travis thanked him.<ref>[[Say Her Name]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nTheo attended Maya and Carina's wedding after Anthony Hughes invited him. He got the couple a massager.

She turned him down, saying she wasn't really dating because of the pandemic.<ref>[[Out of Control]], x (S)</ref> However, at a later meeting, Vic said she may have been a little rash turning him down and they made arrangements to go for a date after their next Covid test.<ref>[[Learning to Fly]], x</ref> The date went well, but while they were together, Theo got a call asking him to sub at station  the next day. Vic asked him not to tell anyone they were seeing each other and he agreed to that. When they were at the station, Vic learned that Theo was previously a captain and was the reason Travis's husband, Michael, was dead. Vic told him they couldn't see each other anymore because of that, but later comforted him when he said that day didn't just haunt Travis.<ref>[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Maya and Carina's wedding, Anthony Hughes invited Theo to join the celebration.

Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nMaya went with Travis on a medical call. They tended to [[Edith]], who had fallen and dislocated her shoulder, something that had happened before. Maya was shocked that Edith refused pain medication. Travis saw her foot shaking and asked if she had seen a doctor for it, but she said she was fine. Travis told her she needed an adjustable bed and her grandson was supposed to get her one. She said that she hadn't told her grandson about it because she didn't want him to worry. Travis later went back to check on her and her grandson was there, so he talked to the two of them together about her seeing a doctor.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop. They later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter a small e-cigarette fire, the team was later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital. At the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she was scared of fire. They decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis and Maya used torches to drill Vic, but she stopped the drills and said they weren't helping.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station . Ripley started to ask him about how he was dealing with his husband's death and how he was adjusting to being at station , but Travis said he'd rather talk about the Captain decision, the reason they were there. He said that he thought he knew who he'd pick, but after that call, he knew Andy had made the right call when Jack wouldn't have. He told Ripley that Andy thinks like a Captain.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. Outside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount. The trapped were freed when they used the water heater to cause an explosion and compromise the door just enough to give them access.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. Ben and Travis treated patients with minor burns at triage and sent them out. When Jack and Dean found combustibles on a floor above the fire, a rapid evacuation was started. In order to release the civilians from the top floor, Ripley sent Ben and Travis to clear the black smoke out of the stairwells so they could walk down. They did so, but when the fire jumped floors and broke out the windows, a flying shard of glass became impaled in Travis' chest. With the radios not working, Ben attempted to drag Travis down the stairs. On the stairs, they ran into Molly, who had been trampled by a panicked mob, leaving her gravely injured. Seemingly reconciling himself to fate, Travis urged Ben to leave him and get Molly to safety, which he reluctantly did. Travis was later found by Vic who was on her way to find someone to help Maya and Andy save Jack. She started pulling him down the stairs, where she met up with Dean, who was going to go after Jack, but Vic convinced him to stay with her and help her get Travis out. They were able to get Travis down the stairs and into an ambulance. By that point, Travis had lost so much blood that his heart stopped twice before they reached the hospital. Travis was taken into surgery, where it was discovered the glass had penetrated his heart. Initially, Vic was furious with Ben for leaving Travis, but she changed her tone after she learned Molly had died in surgery. Though the repair was difficult, Travis survived his surgery and spent the next several weeks with Grant, who helped take care of him as he recovered.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Travis came despite being on leave because he didn't want to miss the moment. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Travis helped Ben, who had been left behind at the station as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSullivan had suggested a peer group for firefighters to Travis and Vic to work out their conflict. They weren't going to go, but ultimately chose to. They were surprised to hear [[Lucas Ripley|Fire Chief Ripley]] talk about the skyscraper fire and the trauma he still experienced in the aftermath.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Travis was paired with Dean, who didn't want to talk to him about his birthday. Upon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis, Dean, and Ben responded to the call when [[Hannah Sherwood]] got her hand caught in her garbage disposal. She'd reached down there when her wedding ring had fallen in and got her hand caught. She turned it off quickly, but then decided to wait for help instead of trying to pull her hand out. Travis said he'd disconnect it and then take it apart to release her hand. While they were work, Hannah noticed that her daughter had gotten a tattoo and asked one of them to check it out to see if it was infected. Dean did and put antibiotic ointment on it. Travis was finally able to free Hannah's hand and they told her to follow up with the hospital in a few days.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him. Travis tried, but Jack left and wouldn't answer his phone.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor, where Travis was disappointed not to see any hot strangers.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter breaking up with Grant, Travis tried a revolving door of hobbies. Vic tried to support him through this, but didn't really understand the appeal. Vic also decided to tell Travis about her relationship with Ripley. He was shocked to learn she'd been hooking up with the Chief.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen, Dean, and Travis had planned to work together to repaint Travis's place. As they prepared to leave, Sullivan talked his way into an invitation to join them. With Sullivan there, they painted in virtual silence. When Sullivan started dancing while painting, they were disturbed, but he explained that when a month ago, you couldn't move your legs, you dance when a song comes on that makes you want to dance. The rest of them started to dance as well.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. After she was sent to the hospital, a broken cell phone and a secret extra propane tank caused an explosion, so they had additional difficulty stabilizing the building so it wouldn't collapse.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAs an openly gay firefighter, Travis is often hailed for being braver than most, to which he responds in modest tone. Travis is the heart of the station. He keeps everyone on track and helps his team members grow. Following the death of his firefighter husband Michael under an unexperienced Captain, Travis became stickler for following the rules and he makes sure that the newbies stay in line.\n\nHe considers himself an open book aside from a few details that he likes to keep to himself, such as his birthmarks. He has a tendency to obsess, sometimes over rather small things, which can compromise his otherwise great listening skills.\n\n\n\n[[Michael Cooper Williams|Michael Williams]] \n[[File:SxTravisMichael.png|thumb|A photograph of the married couple.]]\nTravis was married to a man named Michael Williams until Michael died on duty. He was a firefighter, too. He describes his late husband as his one true love. He told Andy he lost his husband to a captain who was too green, which made him worry about her being up for the job, because her lack of experience compared to Jack.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter his husband's death, he ordered food and had grief sex with the delivery guy to combat the loneliness.\n\n[[Grant (Station )|Grant]]\nTravis met Grant at his grandmother's retirement community.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey met again when Travis took Vic to a meditation class at the same place Grant teaches yoga. Grant gave Travis his number, but Travis didn't call. They met up again when Edith called Grant to her and called emergency services in an attempt to set the two of them up. They agreed to get breakfast, but when Grant showed up at the station the next morning, Travis admitted to Grant that while he was attracted to him, he doesn't date because he didn't want anyone to go through being widowed like he had. Grant laid out what he had planned for their first three dates and convinced Travis to agree to get breakfast for real.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nGrant made Travis eggs in a jar for breakfast, which Travis agreed was the best thing he ever tasted. While they ate, Travis advised Grant that he needed to go very slowly, to ease back into dating. Grant promised he was okay with that, that he knows when it's worth the wait. Despite Travis's words, he later went to Grant after a long day at work and kissed him.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nGrant came to the hospital when Travis was injured in the fire, but couldn't get information from the desk because he wasn't family. But he found Ben and Vic, who updated him. He was worried that Travis had lied to him about always working in pairs when he learned that Travis had been left alone. When he learned that Ben had been with him and then left him to die, he was upset. He stayed at the hospital to see how Travis came out and when Travis survived his surgery, Grant helped take care of him as he recovered, keeping a strict eye on him.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> Grant was unhappy when Travis decided he wanted to go back to work instead of taking the additional time off Grant wanted. He said he was worried he'd lose Travis, but Travis reassured him.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref> Due to Travis' injury, Travis said they skipped the early romance, including having sex for the first time. To combat this, Travis wore part of his uniform and seduced Grant.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDuring Friendsgiving, things became awkward when Greg assumed they were married after seeing Travis's ring and Grant denied it quickly and emphatically. This worried Travis, who asked Grant about it at the end of the day. Grant revealed that he didn't want to get married.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref> After the windstorm was over, Travis and Grant talked and decided to end things because they had different visions of the future.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Emmett Dixon]]\nTravis and Emmett met and hooked up. The next morning, Travis was surprised when a naked Emmett joined him in the shower, thinking he would have left already. Afterward, Travis left for work and was shocked to see that Emmett was the new probie of the station and also [[Michael Dixon|Fire Chief Dixon's]] son. After a call, Travis briefly spoke to Emmett and brought up that Emmett hadn't told him he was a firefighter. Emmett simply replied Travis hadn't asked.\n\nWhen Travis learned that Emmett was closeted and in a long-term relationship with a women, he ended things, though Emmett continued to show interest and feelings towards Travis. Eventually, Emmett ended things with his fianc\ue, came out as gay, and quit being a firefighter.\n\nAfter he left his fianc\ue, the two of them continued hooking up. However, Emmett had fallen in love with Travis, feelings Travis did not reciprocate. After Emmett admitted his feelings, Travis called it quits. After a fire and talking to some drag queens, they made him realize he didn't have an actual friend who were part of the queer community. He reached out to Emmett and asked if they could be friends. Emmett agreed and the two of them became friends. Over the course of time, Travis started to realize he had stronger feelings for Emmett. On the night of Maya and Carina's wedding, he admitted to Emmett that he really liked him. This shocked Emmett, who said he couldn't let himself be hurt by Travis again. Travis accepted the answered and started to walk away, but Emmett pulled Travis in for a kiss.<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x (S)</ref> The two ended up in bed that night, which re-started their relationship. \n\nThe two of them were in a happy relationship until Travis started to realize that he liked Emmett, but he wasn't in love with him. During a Crisis One call in which a man wanting to set himself on fire, Travis tried to build a connection with the man by admitting that he was falling out of love with his boyfriend.<ref>[[The Little Things You Do Together]], x (S)</ref> After that day, Emmett ignored Travis's attempts at communication. Travis wanted to apologize and kept asking Victoria what grand gesture to do to get Emmett to forgive him. Emmett came to the station and told him to stop.<ref>[[In My Tree]], x (S)</ref> During another Crisis One call, they found a man who had died and had not been found for over a month. Travis realized that he would rather be alone then be with someone he didn't love. However, Emmett got scared and thought that he didn't want to be alone. Travis was going to end things with Emmett, but Emmett surprised Travis by saying he forgave him, that they could forget that day.<ref>[[Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire]], x (S)</ref> Emmett invited Travis to a dinner at his parents' house but didn't tell him it was for his father's birthday. Over the course of the night. Travis fought Michael Dixon on many topics. At the end of the night, Emmett told Travis he had applied for an opportunity in Italy to study art. He told Travis that he knew that they couldn't be together. He admitted that he was just scared of being alone like the dead guy. Travis said he really did care about Emmett before leaving.<ref>[[Alone in the Dark]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\nIn , Travis got engaged to Michael. When they told Travis's parents, they were silent on the issue and then his father left the table. As they planned the wedding, Travis asked his mother to read a poem she'd written while she was pregnant with Travis at the ceremony. She agreed, but on the day of the wedding, neither of his parents came. Michael promised to be his family and show up for him.\n\nAfter the wedding, Nari read the poem to them privately. Michael said she'd done her best, though Travis said it wasn't enough.\n\nHe was once caught skipping Sunday School, and his father gave him the silent treatment for a year.<ref>[[House Where Nobody Lives]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Victoria Hughes]]\nTwo weeks after his husband died, Travis was working at Station , where he met Victoria Hughes. They had a rocky start because she disliked him second guessing her, but Vic helped him through his grief and they bonded as Travis pushed Vic to train harder and do better.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon his return to work, Travis noticed some tension between himself and Vic. He asked her about it, but she denied anything was wrong. This later built up to a fight when she revealed that she was upset that he'd quit on life in the skyscraper. Sullivan told them to stop fighting at the station and suggested a peer support group where they could go.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTravis and Vic mended their relationship\uaat the support group and it was further strengthened by the fact that she later told him about her secret relationship with Chief Lucas Ripley. In Travis' own words he felt that they'd \"really come full circle\" and that he was glad to have his best friend back.\ua\n\nLater, he confided in her that he was still really hung up on Michael and she said that sounded pretty normal considering how awesome Michael was.\ua\n\nThroughout their relationship, Vic talked to Travis about Lucas and when Lucas suggested getting married for practical reasons, Travis talked her out of saying yes, because he said something real was more important than something practical.\ua\n\nWhen Lucas was in hospital and Vic had to say her final goodbyes, Travis held her hand and helped her through it. He was devastated that his best friend had to go through what he went through with Michael.\n\nOn the day of the funeral, Travis and Vic fell out as he thought she should attend because she needed to accept what had happened no matter how awful it was, but she didn't want to. She commented that Travis was still in denial over Michael. However, during Sullivan's speech about his best friend, the two shared a quick\uaheartfelt glance and appear to make up. That evening, Travis defended Vic by beating up another firefighter who said nasty things about her and Ripley's relationship at a bar.\n\nVic noticed Travis wasn't at the station and worried a little about him, but Sullivan brushed her off. Pruitt bailed Travis out of jail and went with him and Ryan Tanner to LA, where the rest of the team were fighting a wildfire.\n\nTravis helped Vic get into her bed for the first time since Lucas' death and he even managed to make her laugh.<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nTravis is close with all the firefighters at the station and he works well with everyone.\n\n\nTravis is a firefighter at [[SFD Station |Station ]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]]. By seniority, he was acting captain when lieutenants Andy Herrera and Jack Gibson were off to take their captaincy drill test.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref> He doesn't want to move up the ladder because he signed up to save lives, not to push paper around all day. \n\nAfter seeing Montgomery in action, Chief Ross suggested he tried to become a Lieutenant.

''(\"[[Bring the Pain]]\")'' However, their dinner was interrupted when a train derailed and she had to go back to work. ''(\"[[Into You Like a Train]]\")''\n\n\nWhile on his way to the hospital to see Bailey for their son's birth, Tucker was in a car accident. He had a fractured skull and a brain contusion. He was taken into surgery. During his surgery, the ORs were evacuated because of the bomb in a body cavity, but Derek refused to leave Tucker or close because he knew Tucker would die if he did. He allowed the rest of the surgical staff to leave and continued operating. ''(\"[[It's the End of the World]]\")''\n\nWhile Derek was operating, he was informed that Meredith had replaced [[Hannah Davies]] holding the bomb. At the same time, Tucker coded. Derek tried desperately to save him and after a while, he was successful. ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\nHe was later discharged and sent home. He was told he wouldn't be able to drive for an additional six weeks. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Tucker was having surgery, his wife gave birth to their son, [[William George Bailey Jones]]. ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n\nTucker became upset because he didn't think his wife was spending enough time at home. She asked him to drop Tuck off at his mother's and meet her for lunch so they could talk. However, when he arrived at the hospital, she was in surgery. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\nBailey sent George to ask Tucker to wait while she took a patient back into surgery. He agreed to wait for a while, but after she was delayed several more times, he refused to stay. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nOne day, while Tuck was home with Tucker, a bookshelf fell on him. He was rushed to the ER and then into surgery to repair the damage. The surgery was successful, but he still wasn't breathing on his own. In an attempt to help, they had a faith healer in the hospital, [[Elizabeth Archer]], come see him. After she had them do a healing ritual, Tuck started breathing on his own again. Later that night, Tucker went back to the house to get a few things and got himself a hotel room. ''(\"[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]\")''\n\n\nAfter she told him she wanted to start a [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship]], Tucker gave her an ultimatum: him or the job. She left him because a marriage that resorts to ultimatums is not a marriage, but also turned down the fellowship because she was going to be a single mom. ''(\"[[Now or Never]]\")'' By Christmas Eve of Bailey's first year as an attending, his parents-in-law found out they were in the process of a divorce. His [[William Bailey|father-in-law]] disapproved. By New Year's Day, the couple had divorced. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nMiranda Bailey is Tucker's first wife. They are implied to have been together from a very young age. [[Richard Webber]], who attended their wedding with his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]] said Bailey was a \"child\" when she married Tucker. ''(\"[[Run, Baby, Run]]\")''  Webber got the couple a set of ramekins for the wedding.  ''(\"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\")''  \n\nThey'd been married for ten years when Bailey became pregnant with their son. ''(\"[[Bring the Pain]]\")''\n\nHowever, in his opinion, Miranda never spent enough time at home. She even left their ten year anniversary dinner for work. She didn't trick or treat with her son, and her son even got badly injured looking for his mother. Miranda and Tucker constantly bickered, so they started talking about divorce and he began dating other women and moved out, leaving Miranda sleeping alone for the first time in twelve years.\n\nThey began to attend marriage counseling. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nWhen Miranda told him she was trying to get a fellowship in pediatric surgery, he gave her an ultimatum, him or her job. Miranda decided to stay with general surgery, but decided to leave Tucker anyway because partners shouldn't give ultimatums. ''(\"[[Now or Never]]\")'' \n\n\nHe gave up his job to be a stay at home dad for his son, Tuck. Miranda reminds him during an argument that when he is ready, his job will still be waiting for him.\n\n\n*He was  at the time of his car accident.<ref>[[It's the End of the World]], x</ref>\n*Regarding the news of his impending divorce, his ex-father-in-law [[William Bailey|Bill]] said Bailey's, \"cousin said something to her husband in front of your niece, who said something to your younger niece, who said something to your mother.\" The dialog suggests she has at least one sibling who had children, but it is later revealed Miranda's only sibling died as an infant, so she would not have any biological nieces via a sibling. Bailey's father was either referring to Tuck's sibling's two daughters or it's a continuity error.\n*According to Bailey and Richard, he and his wife [[Adele Webber]] attended Bailey and Tuck's wedding ten years before the start of the series. It is unknown how Bailey knew her boss years before beginning her internship or if this is a continuity error.\n*On his [[Bring the Pain|first appearance]], he was credited as Bailey's Husband.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nBailey'sHusband.png|[[Bring the Pain]]\nTuckerJones.png|[[It's the End of the World]]\nTuckerJones.png|[[As We Know It]]\nTuckerJones.png|[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\nTuckerJones.png|[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\nTuckerJones.png|[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\nTuckerJones.png|[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]\nTuckerJones.png|[[Losing My Mind]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Tucker Jones Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Tucker Jones]]\n[[es:Tucker Jones]]\n[[fr:Tucker Jones]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Tucker}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She was briefly engaged to [[Lucas Ripley]] until his death. She is in a relationship with [[Theo Ruiz]].\n\n\n\nGrowing up, Victoria mainly lived with her grandmother Marion due to her parents being busy at their restaurant. While her father valued good grades, her grandmother was less strict and valued fun in life over professional success. She shared her love of musicals and singing talent with Vic. Over time, Vic learned to care for her grandmother as she began suffering from dementia. Vic landed the lead role in a performance of ''Pirates of Penzance'' and invited her parents to the premiere. They disappointed her by not showing up. Her grandmother, at that point heavily demented, used one of the tickets Vic had saved for her parents to get into the theater and loudly started singing along to \"Poor Wandering One,\" one of the songs she and Vic used to sing together when she was younger. Marion even walked onto stage, further disrupting the performance.<ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBy , her grandmother passed away and her parents returned to work almost immediately, leaving Vic to process her grief alone. At the time, she had landed the lead role in a musical and her emotions got the better of her during rehearsals. The director, [[Cooper]], told her not to apologize for it as her emotional life had been part of the reason why he had chosen her for the role. During rehearsals, [[Pruitt Herrera|Captain Pruitt Herrera]] and a colleague arrived to make sure everything was up to fire safety regulations. Having passed the process with flying colors multiple times before with other productions, Cooper convinced him to let it slide this once to spare them all the time. Soon after, during a final rehearsal, a fire broke out backstage. The entire production's cast and crew managed to make it to the exit, except for Cooper, who tried to save an expensive piano. Vic, who had stayed in the room to make sure everyone made it out safely, witnessed his pants getting caught on fire. She ran back to the stage as Station  arrived. Pruitt pulled her away from the stage and took her outside while Cooper was being burned alive. The whole experience made her decide to get into the Fire Academy and she ended up working with Pruitt at Station .<ref>[[Bad Guy]], x (S)</ref> By , she joined the station as the new probie. On her first day, she met Travis in the locker room as he was crying over his husband's death. Her humor and cheerful demeanor made him laugh for the first time since Michael's death, marking the start of their close friendship.<ref>[[No One is Alone]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station  responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station  responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy was confused about her feelings, she called Maya and Vic to drink and hang out. They talked on the porch and admitted Ryan's looks when he came over to talk to Andy.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nVic tested out the fire simulator while no one else was around. When a fire burst toward her, she flinched and pulled the goggles off her face, making Ben suspect something was wrong.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S)|Shock to the System]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nBen noticed Vic seemed to have a fear of fire after the tanker fire. He tried to help her, but she denied there was a problem. However, she later confessed to the rest of the team that she was afraid and they offered to help her without telling Jack or Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTo help her, Travis took her to meditation class, where she just fell asleep due to being woken up so early.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station  was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Maya noticed Vic just starting at the flames and stood with her when she said it helped.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station  arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nVic was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station . In the interview, she criticized Ripley, saying that one of his departments, Station , was so slow that it forced Station  to stop and help. She then said he either had to pick Jack or Andy. Vic apologized for that, but Ripley said she could go, that she'd told him everything he needed to know about how Jack and Andy captained her.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. Outside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount. The trapped were freed when they used the water heater to cause an explosion and compromise the door just enough to give them access.\n\nWhen Jack later asked Dean what happened with the access pad, Vic covered for him and he assured her there wouldn't be a next time.<ref>[[Hot Box]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station  working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the law firm, Maya and Vic worked with [[Molly]], the fire coordinator for the floor who took her job very seriously. They had her watch the stairwell while they checked the floor. When the evacuation was started, they had to keep the civilians calm as they waited for their turns. They sent the first group down with Molly, but when the fire jumped floors through the windows, the civilians panicked and started running down the stairs, which led to them trampling Molly. Maya and Vic worked on fighting the fire and Vic found that she wasn't afraid anymore.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], x (S)</ref>\n\nVic and Maya were evacuating the skyscraper together when they met up with Andy. Andy insisted on staying to rescue Jack, so Maya decided to stay with her to help and sent Vic down to find more people to help. On her way down, she found Travis, who had been left by Ben. She started tending to him and then dragging him down when she found that he was still alive. When Dean came back into the skyscraper and found them, he helped her get Travis out and into an ambulance to the hospital. When they arrived at the hospital, she was upset to see Ben because he'd left Travis. They waited for news on Travis and Molly and after learning that Molly had died, Vic asked Ben if he believed that Travis would live. He said that he hoped so. Travis ultimately survived his surgery and spent several weeks recovering afterward.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station  had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety. Throughout the ordeal, Vic was annoyed that [[Andrew DeLuca]] had been brought along to help, though at the end of the day, he gave her the number of [[David Mayhorn]], another firefighter who had a crush on her.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref>\n\nStation  was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSullivan had suggested a peer group for firefighters to Travis and Vic to work out their conflict. They weren't going to go, but ultimately chose to. They were surprised to hear [[Lucas Ripley|Fire Chief Ripley]] talk about the skyscraper fire and the trauma he still experienced in the aftermath. After the group was over, Vic found him and apologized for yelling at him at the fire. He suggested that at the next group, she should speak about her own experiences.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station  held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Vic was paired with Andy in a group that contained Ryan. Vic tried to force them to talk by suggesting that Ryan go first.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated. At the party, Vic and Ripley flirted over the cake.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. After breaking up the whole tree, they finished the drive to the house, where a fire had started during a rescue. The fire was then extinguished. Ripley then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station .<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor. Vic didn't attend this party because she was spending time with Ripley instead.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Ripley had told his sister about their relationship, Vic decided to tell Travis. He was shocked to learn she'd been hooking up with the Chief.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Kathleen Noonan|Kat]] came into the station to check it out, she met Andy and Vic. She was looking around at all the stations to see where she might fit in, but she didn't believe she'd be able to get a spot at . Andy decided to give her a proper tour. Andy and Vic then talked to Kat about her experience at the Academy and not feeling like she was improving. They suggested rice. They got two bowls of rice and had Kat grip and release it to improve her grip strength. They said Kat needed to find a way to distinguish herself. She revealed that the skyscraper fire had inspired her to apply to the academy, as she'd been working in the building. At the end of the day, Andy introduced Kat to Sullivan.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], x (S)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station . Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. After getting hit by the patient's hand, Vic stepped away to help Andy treat the daughter, giving her glucose and orange juice when she passed out from low blood sugar. She then stepped in to help stabilize the building.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nRipley died from the consequences of hydrofluoric acid poisoning with Vic by his side. After his death, she let his sister and Robert handle the funeral arrangements as she had decided she wasn't going. Her crew tried to convince her to go, but she insisted on not attending. In Travis's final attempt, she revealed she didn't want to go because she was no one to Ripley on paper. However, she changed her mind when Levi showed up at the station with a bouquet and told her that Lucas wanted to give her flowers that said that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. She went to the funeral and was invited by Jennifer to sit with her. Afterwards, she went to her and Lucas's diner and told Cameron that they were not married and that he had died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria tends to meddle where she doesn't belong while revealing little to nothing about her own personal life. As the youngest member of the team, she is eager to prove herself as a crucial part of the team. She's fun-loving, sarcastic, and loyal.\n\n\n\n[[David Mayhorn]]\nAfter rescuing Max Forrester, Andrew DeLuca gave Vic the number of a firefighter from Station , David Mayhorn.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref> The two went out and had sex at Vic's apartment. The next morning, they woke up and said that neither of them usually did that, then proceeded to have sex again.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref> Vic referred to him as a very tall man blanket and nicknamed him Man Blanket .<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> According to Maya, Vic saw him three times a month before the windstorm, but the two ended things before Vic started seeing Ripley.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Lucas Ripley]]\nDuring the Captain peer reviews, Vic yelled at [[Lucas Ripley|Chief Ripley]] for not doing his job and making sure all stations were as good as Station , stating that it took Station  eight minutes to get to the call which affected the team of .<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], x (S)</ref> After the skyscraper, Vic and Ripley had another confrontation in which she blamed him for evacuating the entire building with her whole team still inside and he told her if she came at him like that again, he'd fire her.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen she saw him at the firefighter peer support group, she was surprised to hear that he struggled with the aftermath of the skyscraper fire. After the meeting, she apologized for any role she might have played in his feelings.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], x (S)</ref> They then flirted at the police training session, which came to a head at Dean's birthday party, where they flirted over cake before eventually sleeping together after shift.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> The next morning, she woke up while he was in the shower and decided to sneak out before he finished. She worried about what that said all day and asked [[Jack Gibson|Gibson]] for advice, but when he called at the end of the day, she answered and they presumably agreed to continue seeing each other.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], x (S)</ref> Ripley visited Station  during the windstorm as it was central to the storm, but worried that it would seem like he was there to see her, not that he didn't want to see her, but they were at work. Vic said it wouldn't and that they could be professional at work. After working together on a call breaking up a tree, Vic and Ripley agreed that what they'd done was hot and hooked up at the station.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter Ripley promoted Maya to lieutenant at station , Maya asked Vic for details (because Vic was seeing Mayhorn from ) in front of Ripley. Vic quickly shut down the line of questioning. Ripley later tried asked Vic about Mayhorn, but they were interrupted by Pruitt. During Jack's intervention, he almost exposed Vic and Ripley's secret relationship, but was interrupted by Ripley with news about Herrera and Sullivan.\n\nFour months after the windstorm, they were still seeing each other. They went to Astro Corner Coffee Shop so they could eat together in public. They then started to have sex in the parking lot, but the manager caught them and asked them not to.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Ripley had told his sister about them, Vic started to consider telling someone herself. She decided to tell Travis and told Ripley that she'd told her best friend. Not realizing that meant Travis, Ripley said he knew that she had the sense to tell someone away from the station.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhile working together after the RV crashed into the station, Ripley figured out that Travis was the best friend that Vic had told about their relationship. He confronted Vic about it and Vic revealed that Gibson also knew about them. The two argued in Vic's bunk. Vic asked if their conversation should be over, but Lucas decided to walk away before he said something he didn't mean.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Vic saved a stranded couple and delivered their baby, Lucas was checking up on her in the Aid Car, but Vic told him she didn't need him and that she was awesome to which he responded that he knew. Later, Lucas was taking care of Vic at her apartment and Vic confronted him that they hadn't finished their fight and told him he was wrong because if an argument was all it took to break them up, they shouldn't even be together, so if they couldn't fight and make up, he could take his nice-smelling shirt and go. Lucas responded that he didn't want his shirt back and that no matter what, he didn't want to go, \"I don't want to let you go.\" He then got into bed with Vic despite the fact that she was sick.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref>\n\nSometime after this, Lucas christened Vic with her nickname, \"Eggy\" because of the dish she ordered for breakfast at the Astro Corner Coffee Shop. The manager of the diner apologized about scolding them when they were about to have sex in the parking lot and said they were relationship goals. He also assumed that Vic and Lucas were married, calling Lucas Vic's hubby. Lucas then told Vic about his previous wives and that if he would get married a third time, he would take it very seriously and he wouldn't be game unless he knew it was really right.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> Around this time, Vic met Jennifer, Lucas' sister, and the two hit it off even when Vic told her about how the two of them jumping out of planes during the weekends.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDuring the blackout, Lucas dropped by the station and, upon seeing Pruitt happy from his vacation, suggested he and Vic also take a vacation, but Vic reminded him of why that wouldn't work and all the other strings involved. When the lights went off at the station, Vic and Lucas made out in the hallway. After the call, Vic came home to Lucas and he told her he had vacation days and didn't want to be the guy who didn't use them. They agreed to go and Vic said it didn't matter where because life is too short before realizing it wouldn't work out because it could ruin their careers. Lucas then suggested that maybe they shouldn't be a secret anymore and they shared a kiss.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], x (S)</ref>\n\nThe next morning, they were in their diner discussing their options, and when Lucas told Vic about the disciplinary action involved if they went public, Vic was ready to back out. Lucas then suggested marriage as a way to cheat the system since rank didn't affect spouses working in the same department, but both of them decided it was too crazy before agreeing to explore other options. After Lucas went into a coffee processing plant to rescue the captain of station , Vic told him that they were reckless and that getting married to cheat the system wasn't them before proposing to him for real. Before he could say anything, she panicked and told him he didn't have to answer right then, so they agreed to meet at their diner in the morning for breakfast. The next morning, Vic went to the diner and waited for Lucas for two hours but he didn't show, so Vic stormed out, thinking he'd stood her up, and went to help with overhaul.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> \n\nUnbeknownst to her, Lucas was hospitalized due to a pre-existing condition and the effects from inhaling chemicals at the fire. While Lucas tried to reach her [[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|px|Vic and Lucas share one last kiss and say goodbye]]himself, her team found her and told her what was happening while Vic was rescuing a victim. Vic managed to complete the rescue before rushing off to the hospital, regretting the fact that her last words to Lucas were \"okie dokie\". At the hospital, Vic got into a fight with Jennifer because Jennifer blamed Vic for Lucas' condition. When she found out Vic had proposed, Jennifer allowed Vic to see Lucas and when it was clear Lucas was dying, Jennifer told Vic to go say goodbye to him. The couple reunited, albeit briefly. Vic said they could finally take that vacation and described their dream vacation. Lucas then accepted Vic's proposal and asked if they could get someone in the room to get married, but Vic just wanted to have the moment with him, just them. A crying Vic told him she was really ready to spend the rest of her life with him and Lucas said that at least he got to spend the rest of his with her. They shared a kiss and Vic held his hand until he died. Later, Vic was lying on top of the firetruck crying over her dead fianc\ue as she remembered when they said \"I love you\" for the first time while her team surrounded her.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Lucas died, Vic crashed with Andy and Maya, but left their apartment to go to the diner. When asked where her \"hubby\" was by the manager, Vic lied and said he was at work. Later, she went to work where she tried to act like nothing had happened despite the fact that it was the day before Lucas' funeral and everyone was concerned. She also announced that she wasn't going to the funeral, much to her team's disappointment. Travis, Sullivan, and Jennifer all tried to convince her to attend the funeral, but Vic refused, saying that she was nothing to Lucas. While arguing with Travis, she referred to Lucas as someone who could have been the love of her life, but wasn't her husband. Later, [[Levi Schmitt]] brought Vic a bouquet of flowers that was similar to the one Lucas had bought for her, telling her that Lucas said the bouquet meant he wanted to spend his entire life with her. This finally conviced Vic to attend the funeral and she joined Jennifer who asked her to sit in the area reserved for family members. Vic was devastated and she cried at the funeral before telling Andy and Maya she wanted to be alone afterwards. She took the bouquet of flowers and went to the diner where she told Cam the manager of the diner that Lucas wasn't her husband and she'd lied about him being at work before admitting that Lucas had died.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nVic met Jackson when she responded to a call and found him holding [[Jai Prishna]], who was dangling from a rope over a cliff. She helped him wench Jai up to safety. Later, when she was at the hospital to drop off another patient, he asked her to go get burgers, but she said maybe another time. Later, they had lunch together in the park and talked about Jai. She told him about Lucas dying and he told her about his recent breakup with Maggie. They both agreed that it wasn't a great time for either of them to start a new relationship. Despite this, they continued to see each other, though it remained mostly platonic.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n[[Theo Ruiz]]\nShe and Theo flirted over their morning jog.<ref>[[Don't Look Back in Anger]], x (S)</ref> He later asked her out on a date after seeing her outside her parents' restaurant, which he said had the best pierogi in town. She turned him down, saying she wasn't really dating because of the pandemic.<ref>[[Out of Control]], x (S)</ref> However, at a later meeting, Vic said she may have been a little rash turning him down and they made arrangements to go for a date after their next Covid test.<ref>[[Learning to Fly]], x</ref> The date went well, but while they were together, Theo got a call asking him to sub at station  the next day. Vic asked him not to tell anyone they were seeing each other and he agreed to that. When they were at the station, Vic learned that Theo was previously a captain and was the reason Travis's husband, Michael, was dead. Vic told him they couldn't see each other anymore because of that, but later comforted him when he said that day didn't just haunt Travis.<ref>[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Maya and Carina's wedding, Anthony Hughes invited Theo to join the celebration. He did and after the wedding, he ended up kissing Vic outside her parents' restaurant.<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Anthony Hughes]] and [[Lenya Hughes]]\nHer parents own [[Kaminski's]], a restaurant that serves Polish food. It's not successful enough for them to hire help so they run it themselves and are there all the time. As such, they don't have free time to visit their daughter, which means she has to go to the restaurant if she wants to see them.<ref>[[Eulogy]], x (S)</ref> Their restaurant got destroyed during a protest, which brought Vic and her parents together.<ref>[[Say Her Name]], x (S)</ref> It was remodeled in time for [[Maya and Carina's Wedding]].<ref>[[Forever and Ever, Amen]], x (S)</ref>\n\n[[Marion Hughes]]\nVic had a strong relationship with her grandmother. She would watch movies with her and share her grades with her. Her grandmother developed dementia though and would forget things. Vic was often the one taking care of her grandmother and making sure she took her pills. Vic's grandmother's favorite show was \"Pirates Of Penzance\" <ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\n[[Travis Montgomery]]\nTwo weeks after his husband died, Travis was working at Station , where he met Vic. They had a rocky start because she disliked him second-guessing her, but Vic helped him through his grief and they bonded as Travis pushed Vic to train harder and do better.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref> \n\nWhen Vic struggled with her fear of fire, she told her team while Andy and Jack were at the Incinerator and the team promised to help her overcome it while keeping it a secret from the two lieutenants as they were required to report it. Travis took Vic to meditation class where they ran into Grant and later helped Maya run some drills with Vic.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], x (S)</ref>\n\nVic was the one who found Travis in the stairwell at the skyscraper fire and dragged him down the stairs before running into Miller who helped her carry Travis outside. She rode with Travis in the Aid Car and waited for news on his condition with Warren and Grant.<ref>[[No Recovery]], x (S)</ref>\n\nUpon his return to work, Travis noticed some tension between himself and Vic. He asked her about it, but she denied anything was wrong. This later built up to a fight when she revealed that she was upset that he'd quit on life in the skyscraper. Sullivan told them to stop fighting at the station and suggested a peer support group where they could go.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], x (S)</ref> After the peer support group, their friendship seemed to be on the mend as they were seen discusing Travis and Grant's relationship and Vic told her friend he needed to spice things up.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref> When Travis was struggling with the fact that Grant didn't want to get married, he asked Vic for her advice and she told him that marriage wasn't everyone's endgame.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], x (S)</ref>\n\nAfter she found out that Ripley told his sister about their relationship, Vic told Travis who was shocked and the two discussed Ripley being Vic's new hobby. Vic also comforted Travis when he revealed he was still hung up on Michael.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], x (S)</ref> Travis knowing later led to Vic and Ripley's first fight when he accidentally revealed to the latter that he knew about their secret relationship.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], x (S)</ref> When Vic was upset after her and Ripley's fight, Travis comforted her but sent her home when she was sick.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Ripley ran into the burning coffee plant to rescue another captain, Travis made sure to support Vic and when Vic returned to overhaul, Travis asked her what had happened with Ripley since he knew about the proposal.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> Travis was worried to tell Vic about Ripley's condition while she was on the tower, but at Herrera's insistence, he radioed Vic and told her what had happened. He later told Vic that if she needed him to hunt down Dr. Pierce for her he would. When Vic had to go and say goodbye to Lucas, Travis held her hand as they walked through the hallway and he also hugged her when the entire team laid down with Vic on the firetruck while she cried over the loss of Ripley.<ref>[[Always Ready]], x (S)</ref> \n\nAfter Ripley died, Travis was very concerned for Vic and he was surprised when she was back at work. He offered to take Vic to his place or to Andy and Maya's as Vic wasn't back at her apartment, but Vic refused and lashed out. When Vic said she wasn't coming to the funeral, Travis constantly tried to convince her to come which led to a fight between the two in which Vic pointed out the differences between her and Travis' experiences with loss, adding that she wasn't Travis and Lucas wasn't Travis' husband. In the end, though Vic did go to the funeral.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref> \n\n\n\n\nVictoria is a firefighter at [[SFD Station |Station ]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]].

Maya, remembering the news reports about an outbreak of the avian flu, called out to report the symptoms and the CDC was called in. Another subway passenger, [[Neil]], had been on the same flight and also had some symptoms.

''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Tuck was still very young, his mother brought him into the hospital with her. She took him into an OR gallery, where they observed part of [[Jake Burton|Jake Burton's]] surgery. She took him out of the gallery when Jake coded. ''(\"[[Yesterday]]\")''\n\nOnce her maternity leave ended, she had to bring Tuck into the hospital with her because the nursery was full and Tucker was out of town. When she got paged into surgery, she had Cristina babysit him. ''(\"[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\")''\n\nTucker took a year off work so that he could take care of Tuck at home. Miranda always felt bad about not having enough time to spend with him so she started to call them from the hospital, once making a late-night call to sing \"God Bless the Child\" to him. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nOnce, he flooded his house after sticking a toy down the toilet.\n\n\n[[File:BabyTuck.jpg|thumb|left|px|Baby Tuck]]\nOne day, Tuck went to his mother's office in search of her and a bookshelf fell on him. Tuck was rushed to the ER so they could assess his injuries. They ran a full trauma panel and took him for a CT. The CT revealed that his stomach was in his chest and his colon was ruptured. They took him into surgery. When Bailey came into the OR while they were operating, Erica stopped and refused to continue until Bailey left. In order to get her to leave, Cristina agreed to hold Tuck's hand. The surgery was successful, but there was still fluid in his chest, so they didn't know how soon he'd be able to breathe on his own. Desperate to help her son, Bailey invited a faith healer, [[Elizabeth Archer]], to do a healing ritual on Tuck. Afterward, he started breathing on his own and was able to be extubated. ''(\"[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen he was fourteen months old, he punched someone in his day care named Harrison over a graham cracker. Bailey had to bribe the director to keep Tuck there with medical perks for some of the staff and supplying fruit slices. Tucker told her it had happened numerous times before. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the hospital shooting, Tuck went with his mother to see his grandparents for a month. ''(\"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\")''\n\n\nWhile his mom was treating [[Holly Wheeler]], a kidnapping victim, she came to collect Tuck from the hospital daycare to find he was not there. She had been deeply disturbed by the circumstances under which Holly had been abducted from the street by her kidnapper and she jumped to the conclusion that the same had happened to Tuck. It turned out that he had been taken to see a nurse as he had a nose bleed and was reunited with Miranda just after she insisted that another teacher call a 'Code Pink'. ''(\"[[The Girl with No Name]]\")''\n\n\nTuck attended his mother's wedding to [[Ben Warren]]. ''(\"[[Things We Said Today]]\")''\n\n\nTuck told Ben he wanted to be a mad scientist for Halloween, so Ben spent a lot of time helping him create the perfect costume and the two of them decorated the house to look like his lab. ''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\n\nHis mother and Ben took him to an amusement park. He was an inch too short to ride one of the rides, so he tried to scam the ticket taker. He wanted to stuff his shoes with his socks to make himself look taller. He threw a fit when his mom wouldn't let him. ''(\"[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]]\")''\n\n\nTuck was sent home from school after punching a kid in his class. Bailey let him sit in her office, not wanting to bring the hammer down on him after spending all day doing so with her employees. Ben convinced her to tap him in and he used a \"scare straight\" attempt, showing Tuck [[Andrew DeLuca|Andrew's]] scans and lying to say that Andrew was blind in one eye and Alex was in jail for punching him. It was effective and Tuck handed his phone over to his mother for two weeks and promised to apologize to the kid and never do it again. ''(\"[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]]\")''\n\n\nDuring a teacher work day, Tuck and his friend, [[Rocco]], didn't have school, so they came to the hospital. Ben was supposed to sign Tuck up for Science Camp, but he forgot, so Maggie offered to do a science camp with the kids instead. They enjoyed the science she showed them and asked how she did it. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nAfter treating [[Eric Sterling]], Ben and Bailey knew it was time to give Tuck The Talk. They taught him how, as a Black person, to deal with interactions with the police, telling him to be polite and respectful, even when others aren't. They told him his only job was to make it home safe at the end of the day, so he could become everything he wanted to be. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nTuck had a history presentation to give at school, so he got dressed up. He was embarrassed by his mother taking a picture of him on the drive to school because his tie wasn't straight. He later told his mother the presentation went well and he got a standing ovation from all the teachers. ''(\"[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\")''\n\n\nTuck pulled the fire alarm at his school to get Ben there as quickly as possible with no questions. He needed Ben's help because his friend [[Ava Linsley]] was in labor. Tuck then helped Ben and Vic deliver Ava's baby. To keep Tuck from getting in trouble, Ben told him to turn his sweatshirt inside out and cleaned his hands with a wipe so no one would know he had pulled the alarm. ''(\"[[Invisible to Me]]\")''\n\n\nOn Dia De Los Muertos, Tuck decorated a sugar skull and told his mom about the day. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n\nAfter learning that Tuck was \"talking to\" a girl, Ben and Bailey decided they needed to talk to him about dating and consent and condoms. Ben offered to do it as his father had done for him. He took Tuck for burgers and explained to him that consent is necessary and if at any point, anyone he's with isn't having fun, everything stops. ''(\"[[Silent All These Years]]\")''\n\n\nTuck visited Ben at the station and had a meal with him and the rest of the team. When Tuck left abruptly, Ben tried to stop him, but Tuck called him out on not having much time for them lately because of his Medic One training. At the end of the day, while driving Tuck home, he told him the story of what happened with [[Elliot (The Dark Night)|Elliot]] and his daughter. Tuck agreed that it really sucked. Inspired by Elliot, however, Ben decided to spend the night outside with Tuck looking at the stars. ''(\"[[The Dark Night]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Joey Phillips]] was discharged without anywhere to go, Bailey took him to her house, where he played video games with Tuck. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\n\nBen came home after a long shift to find Joey and Tuck playing basketball together. He then joined their game. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n\nTuck and Joey came with Bailey to the spaghetti dinner fundraiser to help raise money for Pruitt's funeral. They ate voraciously, then discussed their mutual desire to go down the fire pole, which Ben said they couldn't do. When they cleared their plates, they asked if they could go get more, which Ben said they could. ''(\"[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\")''\n\n\nAt the start of the Covid- pandemic, Ben's sister Rosalind came to live at her brother's house to watch Tuck and Joey while Ben and Bailey both quarantined due to their work. Both boys enjoyed this change and wanted Rosalind to continue to stay with them. Rosalind brought them down to the hospital one evening to clap for the healthcare workers at the hospital along with the firefighters of station . ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")'' ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Lorelei]] the tiger escaped into Seattle and was eventually trapped in the barn at station , Tuck and Joey FaceTimed Ben so they could see her. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\n\nBen came home one day after living at the station since the start of the pandemic. He said he'd tested negative for the virus, but then told them that Bailey's mother had died. Tuck lashed out at him, saying Ben wasn't his dad, before fleeing to his room and refusing to speak to anyone. Ben drew him out of his room by cooking spaghetti. Tuck apologized and asked him how he and his mom deal with seeing people die so often. Ben explained that while sometimes they could only do damage control, sometimes, they're the answer to someone's prayers. And helping that person can do more than save a life. They can restore someone's faith, which strengthens his own. He then said they'd get through this by showing up for each other.
