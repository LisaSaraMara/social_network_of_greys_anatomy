She then tagged along with [[Mika Yasuda]], whom she recognized from the introduction, so they could find scrubs together. As they walked Jules, shared that she had already slept with an attending, a fact that Mika shared with the rest of the interns much to Jules's dismay. After changing into the scrubs, the group of interns were welcomed by interim Chief of Surgery [[Meredith Grey]] in the newly equipped OR. She stressed that their life stories and their fight was had gotten them into the program rather than their grades. \n\nAfterward, Amelia took the interns to the ICU and informed them about a bus driving off a cliff during the tornado, rendering fourteen patients potentially brain dead and thus organ donors. She assigned each intern a patient to examine and confirm brain death. Jules's patient was among the brain dead patients so she had to inform the family. Her patient turned out to be a match for one of Maggie's patient awaiting a heart transplant. Having read Maggie's article about racial disparities in outcomes after bypass surgery, Jules was a fan of hers and eager to inform Maggie. In need of some good news, she asked Maggie if she could be part of the procedure, which Maggie allowed. Together, they informed Howard and his emotional husband about the availability of a donor heart. However, the joy was cut short during the organ retrieval when Maggie deemed that there were too many hematomas on the donor heart for it to be used.

He cautioned her to always be polite to [[BokHee]].\n\nLater, she found Link waiting for her outside the intern locker room and he inquired about her first shift. She told him it seemed endless and was both exhilarating and depressing. He then revealed he brought HR paperwork about their relationship for her to sign so things wouldn't get messy. She clarified they did not have a relationship and that she just considered him a friend. He claimed he didn't want a relationship either but she pointed out he had been waiting for her outside the locker room like a stalker. The interns then met up in [[The Tunnels|the tunnels]] and reflected on their first shift.
