She wanted to test how long it would take before someone took a look at her, and when April finally approached her, she told her she'd been  minutes in the ER bed. ''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:MeetingRichard.png|thumb|px|Alana meeting Richard again.]]\nAfter she met up with Owen, he gave her a tour around the hospital. She met Derek, and told him she'd watch his surgery the next day. While informing Owen on the waiting time in the ER, they ran into Richard Webber. Alana was one his students. At first, Richard thought she came to the hospital looking to join the staff.\ua\n\nThey also ran into Arizona, who was trying to relax in one of the lounges. While entering the lounge, Alana told Owen she'd be looking at everything in the hospital. Alex informed her on a pediatric case, and she shared a conversation with him and Arizona. She told she'd watch her surgery the next day.\n\n[[File:ORObserving.png|thumb|left|px|Alana watches Alex stabbing Arizona in her prosthetic foot.]]The next day, she was trying to fit in as many surgeries as possible in her schedule. Jo Wilson deliberately changed the hour of Derek's surgery on the OR board, so Cahill wouldn't be there.\n\nDuring Arizona's surgery, Alana talked to Owen about the Africa program. When Arizona started to suffer from phantom limb, Dr. Cahill questioned if Arizona even should be allowed in that OR. Too busy to help Arizona, Owen revealed that Derek's surgery had started hours ago, making her leave the gallery to go observe Derek. However, he threw her out of his OR and she walked back in right at the time Owen ordered Alex to stab Arizona's prosthetic with a scalpel. Alana then figured out why Arizona had been acting so strange the past days. ''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\")''\n\n\nDuring a staff meeting, Alana told the doctors she was impressed by what she had seen the past three days. She especially praised the Africa program, saying it was good publicity for the hospital and that she didn't feel like cutting it. However, she did say she would have to make cuts. She surprisingly proposed to close the ER, claiming it was hemorrhaging resources.\ua''(\"[[Walking on a Dream]]\"\u)''\n\nAlana had cameras placed all over the CCU. On the other side of the cameras is a remote physician., who is there to help reduce mistakes, improve patient care and maximize physician hours. She also made sure that the OR's were arranged with maximum efficiency, specifically for OR turnovers.\uaAlana also demanded that the doctors' average time between surgeries,  minutes, would be cut in half.\n\nShe also brought in a doctor to teach the general surgeons a new technique for a hernia repair, claiming it was needed to standardize OR procedures.[[File:ClosedER.png|thumb|px|Owen closes the ER.]]\n\nShe wanted to replace the ER, which was open for one more day, with something she had yet to think about. She sent workmen to measure it up, but Owen sent them off because he didn't want them to be there while the ER was still open.\n\nTrying to save the ER, April and Derek created a whole plan to make budget cuts in every department. When they proudly presented it to Cahill, she said that the hospital couldn't be saved by making budgets cuts, but that it had to be bought. She revealed that she had to make the hospital presentable, and that the ER had to go.\ua''(\"[[Bad Blood]]\")''\n\n\nAlana Cahill managed to find a buyer for the hospital, a group of businessmen named Pegasus. After modernizing the hospital with tablets, she gave them a tour around the hospital, exactly at the time when April brought in a trauma patient. In the empty ER, which was being turned into a hernia clinic, April and several other doctors gave the patient first aid care.[[File:BloodGround.png|thumb|px|Alana notices blood on the ground in the ER.]]\n\nWhen Cahill and a few members of Pegasus were about to visit the ER, Derek managed to distract them long enough so the patient could be moved to an OR. While talking to the Pegasus members about the hernia clinic, Cahill noticed some blood on the floor. It didn't take her long to figure out that someone brought in a trauma patient. She left the Pegasus members with Derek, ordering him to continue the tour.\uaShe found out that April, Meredith and Cristina were operating on the trauma patient. However, Meredith \"accidentally\" deleted the patient's file on the new tablets.\n\n[[File:DerekSpeech.png|thumb|left|px|Alana telling Derek that Pegasus is the only option left for the hospital.]]Cahill then decided to interrogate every doctor involved, starting with the interns. Alex and Jackson then confessed, claiming it was the right thing to do. Owen let them go unpunished, much to Alana's surprise. She paged Shepherd, telling him she knew he helped the other doctors because it was his code that accessed the medication case on the fifth floor. Cahill then reveals that if the kid had died, it would've cost the hospital a lot of money and it would have made Pegasus back out. She revealed Pegasus to be the only option left, and said that if the staff continued to undermine her, the hospital wouldn't stay open.\ua\n\nDuring all this, Callie and Richard visited another hospital that was owned by Pegasus. What they saw there didn't please them, and what the doctors there told them didn't sound good at all. Callie then proposed to the doctors who were involved in the plane crash to buy the hospital themselves.\ua''(\"[[The Face of Change]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:DerekPoster.png|thumb|px|The promo poster with Derek on it.]]\nLike in the other hospitals Pegasus owned, she chose a doctor to promote the hospital. Derek got appointed as face of the hospital, making brochures and giant posters with his face on them. Derek disliked them, but she refused to have them taken down because they served as promotional material for the hospital. The nurses didn't like all the changes, and they all threatened to quit. Cahill needed Owen to talk them out of it. He was successful in doing so.\n\nWhile Alana and Owen were dealing with the nurses, the last thing that had to be dealt with before the hospital could be sold, the group of doctors who were in the plane crash and Callie all come to the conclusion that they should buy the hospital themselves, as Pegasus wouldn't do any good to the hospital.[[File:YelledAt.png|thumb|left|px|Alana gets yelled at by a hospital board member because Pegasus withdrew the offer.]] However, Pegasus moved up the sale to that night, leaving them with too little time to come up with a decent plan. Therefore, they saw only one option left to postpone the sale. During the meeting, Derek, Meredith, Callie, Arizona and Cristina resigned, completely changing the value of the hospital and making Pegasus back out.\n\nAlana was left startled and yelled at by one of the board members and Owen. She stammered she couldn't salvage the sale because there was no way she could replace these doctors and that she couldn't reposition or find new buyers. Owen told her she had to save the sale.\ua''(\"[[Hard Bargain]]\")''\n\nShe did manage to get Pegasus back in, but their counteroffer was to buy the hospital for parts, liquidating its assets and laying off its staff. Alana informed the hospital board, having them pull together an emergency meeting to discuss it. However, like\ua[[Roberta Thompson]]\uatold Alana, the hospital needed an offer, and this was the only one, leaving them with no other choice.\ua[[File:AnotherBuyer.png|thumb|px|Owen tells Alana and the board that the group of doctors wants to buy the hospital.]]\n\nCristina told Owen about their plan to buy the hospital. During the emergency meeting, he walked in and told the board and Alana about the doctors' plan, convincing the hospital board to wait another day. Cahill tried to persuade the board not to wait, because then Pegasus would lose interest for good. However, the board listened to Owen and decided to let the doctors buy the hospital.\n\nWhen Julian Crest refused to invest in the hospital, the doctors' plan had failed and they couldn't buy the hospital. With no offer from Pegasus left, there was no hope for the hospital anymore. Everyone got ready for the hospital to close its doors. Alana thereby didn't manage to save the hospital, but\ua[[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]]\uadid by having the\ua[[Harper Avery]]\uafoundation invest in the hospital.\ua''(\"[[This is Why We Fight]]\")''\n\n\nDr. Cahill was a student of Richard Webber, and he described her as a great student and a gifted surgeon.\n\nHowever, during a surgery, Alana choked. She said that was the reason she left the OR to become a physician advisor. She told Owen she saved a dozen of hospitals before she came to Seattle.\n\nAt the end of her third day in the hospital, Richard said she was judging harshly, but Alana claimed that was part of her job. She also said that during her intern year, Richard said to her that medicine was constantly changing and that she had to be part of the change or get out. She then said that she was making changes, and that he should be proud of her.\n\nAlana said to Owen she was very good at her job. She proved this by making Pegasus interested again in buying the hospital, after they previously backed out because Derek, Meredith, Callie, Arizona, and Cristina all resigned.\n\n\n*She hums to herself while operating.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[Walking on a Dream]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[Bad Blood]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[The Face of Change]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[Hard Bargain]]\nxAlanaCahill.png|[[This is Why We Fight]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n:'''Alana:'''\uaWell, I'll see you in the OR tomorrow.\n:'''[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]:'''\uaTypically, you need to be invited.\n:'''Alana:'''\uaIf things were running typically, I wouldn't be here, now would I?\n\n\n{{Alana Cahill Appearances}}\n[[de:Alana Cahill]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cahill, Alana}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Teddy struggled in the aftermath of Andrew's death, Owen brought her home, along with Allison. Allison struggled with this, asking for her mom and not understanding why Teddy wasn't coming. At the end of the day, when Allison cried, Teddy got out of bed and held her. ''(\"[[In My Life]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, Leo, Allison, and Scout all had a play date together with Teddy and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, Owen came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nAllison came to the park with Teddy and Owen on the day they were meant to get married. The wedding was interrupted by a bicycle accident, but they later got married at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[John (Out for Blood)|John]] reported Owen for stealing drugs from the hospital to euthanize terminally ill soldiers, the whole family was force to flee Seattle suddenly.

She is the youngest sister of [[Derek Shepherd]] and was officially employed at [[Seaside Health and Wellness]] with privileges at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]]. She later relocated to [[Seattle]] and took over Derek's job as the Head of Neurosurgery at Grey Sloan. While in Los Angeles, she was engaged to [[Ryan Kerrigan]] until his death and later to [[James Peterson]] until she moved to Seattle. After moving to Seattle, she had a short-lived marriage to [[Owen Hunt]]. She was in a relationship with [[Atticus Lincoln]] with whom she has a son, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]]. She is currently entertaining a new relationship with [[Kai Bartley]].\n\n\n\nWhen she was , she and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] witnessed their father's murder in his convenience store. She said that afterward her world fell apart and she was in a \"dark place\" for a long time. When she was , she was obsessed with unicorns because they were magical and could do great things.<ref name=\":\">[[Gone, Baby, Gone]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nDuring her teenage years, she was so wild and out of control that she earned the nickname 'Hurricane Amelia'. To escape her pain, she began abusing pills after a friend offered her one. She overdosed and was dead for  minutes until Derek saved her life. This experience urged her to get sober, which she maintained to be for many years. She said it lasted so long that her studious nature made her spend \"the bulk of her twenties in a library\".<ref name=\":\">[[Who We Are]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nShe walked in on [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and her (then) sister-in-law [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] in bed together but kept it secret from her brother, Derek.\n\n\nPart of [[Geraldine Ginsberg|Dr. Geraldine Ginsberg's]] team, Amelia joined her boss in Los Angeles to consult on [[Kayla Lindy|Kayla Lindy's]] case, knowing she would meet her former sister-in-law [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], as her name was all over the case. Dr. Ginsberg found there was nothing she could do for Kayla, but Amelia firmly offered the family an option of hope in the form of an experimental surgery. Geraldine promptly fired Amelia from her team for stepping up to her, but Kayla's husband asked Amelia to perform the surgery. \n\n\nDespite not having talked to him for a while, when Amelia heard that [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] got shot, she was so shocked by this that she started smoking. [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] took her cigarettes away when they were going to visit [[Dell Parker|Dell's]] grave, where Amelia mentioned that the world was a crappy place because of the horrible things that happened lately, like Dell's death and Derek being shot. When she got bored at Addison's house, she visited the practice, hoping there was a patient she could operate on. She spoke to Addison and told her that she called and e-mailed Derek to find out how he was doing, but he did not return her calls, nor did he reply to her e-mails. Addison then told her that he was doing fine. Amelia was surprised that Derek had talked to Addison, while he hadn't talked to her. \"That kinda says it all, doesn't it?\" Amelia said. When Amelia later told Addison that she wanted to go somewhere, Addison told her to start in [[Seattle]] and convinced her that Derek already hated her, so she had nothing to lose by visiting him. \"I'm gonna start in Seattle,\" Amelia then said.<ref>[[Take Two]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAmelia approached [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]] about a job at the practice, referring to herself as a kick-ass, world-class catch. Naomi asked Amelia why she would want to join the practice, as it was a much smaller and conservative gig than she was used to. Initially, Amelia claimed that the practice would be a good environment to broaden her skill set, but Naomi told her not to give the rehearsed answer. Amelia admitted that she had nowhere else to go where she was not alone. The next day, Naomi hired Amelia to work at the practice.<ref>[[Playing God]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAt Charlotte and Cooper's wedding, Amelia, as the maid of honor, took an accidental sip of champagne, mistaking it for the ginger ale she had ordered at the wedding reception. She immediately spit it out, but the accidental slip sparked her craving for alcohol again.<ref>[[Something Old, Something New]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAmelia really started craving alcohol again and went to tell Charlotte about her accidental slip. Charlotte told her not to let it turn into an actual fall as it was just an accident.<ref>[[God Bless the Child]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nBehind Charlotte's back, Amelia did start drinking again and operated on a man drunk. Charlotte soon found out and revoked Amelia's surgical privileges at the hospital, thus effectively removing Amelia from the surgical rotation.<ref>[[...To Change the Things I Can]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAmelia fully gave into her craving and got drunk at a bar. She was dancing on the bar when a quarrel with another woman caused her to fall off the bar and cut her hand open. As the bartender took away her keys, she called Sheldon, who drove her to the hospital. Amelia stitched up her own hand after Sheldon numbed it. Amelia, being the best neurosurgeon, was paged as Pete required brain surgery. Amelia ignored Charlotte's objections and operated, claiming Pete didn't have the time to wait for the other neurosurgeon. The surgery went well and Amelia went to Charlotte to tell her she never had problems with booze, but Charlotte took that as a sign she was in trouble and informed her that her privileges were still revoked. Sheldon then drove Amelia home.<ref>[[God Laughs]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAs Addison moved in with Sam, Amelia had the house to herself and threw a housewarming party. She claimed she didn't drink at the party, though, and showed Charlotte her -day sobriety chip later that day. Charlotte said she'd think about putting her back on the surgical rotation, angering Amelia, as she only opened up about her addiction struggles because Charlotte needed her to. She felt like Charlotte was punishing her harder than she'd do to other people. After a talk with Sheldon, Charlotte followed the book and had Amelia take a breathalyzer test. It was negative, so Charlotte welcomed her back on the surgical rotation. Amelia stated she'd be going to a meeting, but rather go alone. However, that night, Amelia drank an entire bottle of wine by herself while watching TV.<ref>[[Breaking the Rules]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAmelia returned to AA, humiliated to be back at day , realizing she had things to lose in her life. Charlotte, meanwhile, kept checking up on Amelia, who called her a bitch for being so controlling.<ref>[[Deal With It]], x (PP)</ref> Amelia made it to  days, which she told Sheldon was a start.<ref>[[Remember Me]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAfter six months in Italy, [[Michelle]] returned to Los Angeles as her symptoms had progressed. She reminded Amelia of her promise to help her die once that happened. Amelia brought it up to her colleagues, and they reminded her that's considered murder in California, despite the fact that it may be the right thing to do to stop Michelle's suffering. Amelia decided to do it anyway and administer drugs that would end Michelle's life. They had decided they'd pretend that Amelia found her after staging an overdose of pills. Amelia started injecting the drugs, but Michelle had a bad reaction and told her to stop. She was taken to the ER, where Pete managed to save her life. Amelia later made a pact with Michelle to move in together, so she could care for Michelle, who in return could help her to stay sober. However, that night, Amelia went to Michelle's house for a girl's night, only to find Michelle dead on her bed, having taken an overdose of pills for real. Amelia called the cops and swallowed some pills with wine as soon as they left.<ref>[[Step One]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nMichelle's death pushed her over the edge. She started partying hard. One morning, Amelia woke up with a handsome, but unknown man next to her. She threw him out to go to work. She did another breathalyzer test at the hospital, which was negative. Charlotte offered her a leave of absence to mourn Michelle's death, but Amelia just wanted Charlotte off her back. Amelia went home \"sick\" and found out the man hadn't left and was sitting on her deck. They formally introduced themselves as they couldn't remember their first encounter. Amelia then had sex with Ryan again. Knowing she truly liked him, Ryan then revealed he had pills. They cut them up and inhaled the powder. One of Amelia's patients required emergency surgery, but Amelia didn't answer her phone as she and Ryan were high in bed. That night, Amelia wrote them a prescription for more pills, which Ryan went to get at the pharmacy. Charlotte, having figured out that the breathalyzer test was negative because Amelia had started to take pills again, showed up at the house right when Ryan returned from the pharmacy. Charlotte wanted to tell Amelia off, but Amelia simply stated she quit her job and closed the door on her.<ref>[[If I Hadn't Forgotten...]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nThe next morning, Addison dropped by and met Ryan. Amelia told her she took the day off to be with Ryan. They bumped into Cooper and Mason at a taco stand, where Cooper noticed a rude-ish Amelia didn't look well. Addison dropped by again that night, as she and the others were worried about her. Amelia didn't want a lecture and told Addison they stopped being family when Addison cheated on her brother, so Addison could stop worrying over her. Amelia and Ryan fled to a hotel, where they got to know each other better. She forgot to pack her prescription pad, so she had to go to the practice to get another. She forgot to turn the alarm off, so the police busted her. Charlotte, being on call for the practice, showed up and confirmed Amelia was a doctor at the practice. The officers left, and Charlotte asked Amelia for the prescription pad she knew Amelia had come to pick up. Amelia gave her one, told Charlotte to stay out of her life, and revealed she had another prescription pad in her pocket as the elevator doors closed. Back at the hotel, Amelia came down and discovered that Ryan had invited friends over, who thanked her for the scripts. Ryan threw them out as they made Amelia feel uncomfortable. At night, he and Amelia started using intravenous drugs.<ref>[[Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] and the others at Seaside Wellness staged an intervention. They attempted to talk to her but she was too angry and aggressive to properly listen. After a lot of rude and insulting comments towards her friends, hitting them in their weak spots about their problems, Amelia eventually suffered from withdrawal symptoms. She saw through their attempt to give her Buprenorphine, which would make her symptoms disappear and prevent other drugs from getting her high, and demanded they give her more oxycodone. In return, she would stay and listen. \n[[File:PPx-.png|thumb|xpx|Amelia at the intervention staged by her co-workers.]]\nThe other doctors agreed on not supporting her addiction by giving her the drugs, but Addison and Sheldon went and got some pills anyway. High and finally able to listen to their pledges, Amelia actually seemed to agree to go to rehab until Ryan arrived at the practice. Seeing he wore the watch that once belonged to Amelia's dead father, Addison confronted her about how stealing it and giving it away would make Amelia's mother feel. When Amelia didn't properly answer, Addison attempted to tell the story of how her father had died in front of everyone so they could understand what was going on. Immediately, Amelia had an aggressive breakdown, even threatening to kill Addison if she ever told that story to anyone. She and Ryan then quickly left. In their hotel room, both decided to take the last drugs they had and after that, to get sober together. The next morning, Amelia woke up to find Ryan not breathing beside her. He had died of an overdose. This experience destroyed Amelia. After the cops arrived, she told them to call Addison Forbes Montgomery and tell her that Amelia was ready for rehab.<ref>[[Who We Are]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAmelia had a fianc\ue, Ryan, with whom she did drugs when she relapsed after her best friend died by suicide. One night, they decided to take the rest of their drugs and get sober the next day. Amelia woke up the next morning to discover Ryan dead. She later found out she was pregnant (she thought she was just experiencing withdrawal symptoms). It turned out the baby was anencephalic (had no brain). She decided to donate the baby's organs. There was a lot of debate within the practice about it, though the organ donation ultimately occurred, saving the lives of several other infants.<ref>[[Gone, Baby, Gone]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAfter donating her baby's organs, Amelia continued to go to meetings. Soon after she was one year sober, she met the new ER attending [[James Peterson]], who showed a romantic interest towards Amelia. After some struggles, they began a relationship. At Sam and Naomi's second wedding, James promised her that they would get married one day.\n\n\nSomewhere near the end of March , James proposed to her. She accepted, but the engagement made her freak out. She traveled to Seattle to tell Derek what happened. She realized that the engagement meant that she was likely to face a different kind of life, the kind that he and Meredith have. So she came over and visit to see what her life would be if she accepted the engagement. Happy to have found a temporary solution to his and Meredith's problem of combining their careers and family he left her to spend an entire day with the kids. She played with them, cooked dinner, and put them to bed, but when Meredith and Derek came home, they found a completely wrecked Amelia in a messy house. Amelia broke down and told them she couldn't do this. She confessed she didn't just come to Seattle to observe their life; she came here to see if she could do it. She wanted the whole kids, family, and career thing with James, but she realized that she just wouldn't be able to do it as she was already wrecked after one day. Having received an enormous blow to her self-esteem, she ran off crying.<ref>[[Change of Heart]], x</ref> \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Amelia holding her nephew.]]\nShe decided to stay with her brother in Seattle for a while. They worked together on a case to separate conjoined twins who shared brain matter. Even though he unintentionally treated her like an incompetent surgeon, she (well aware that she was in his shadow) proved him wrong by saving the twin who was assigned to her care after the actual separation. At the end of the day, Derek told her that Callie Torres needed an exceptional neurosurgeon for her project, as he was busy with the Presidential project now, and that he recommended her. Amelia objected that she didn't live in Seattle, but he suggested she should, adding he liked having her with him.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia had several phone conversations with her fianc\ue while continuously postponing her return to Los Angeles, resulting in fights with James. She settled in and started bonding with Meredith. They had a surgery planned together, and during the preparation, Amelia ignored several incoming calls. Meredith told her that just because she and Derek were juggling their lives, they didn't need to keep Amelia from her work for that. Amelia snapped at her that she liked her better as the sister-in-law who didn't give a crap about her life and asked if they could go back to that. In surgery, Meredith, thinking she and Derek made Amelia feel obligated to stay with them, told Amelia she could go back home when Derek would come from DC that night. Amelia thought she was kicking her out, but it was not that, as Meredith and Derek loved having her in Seattle, but they didn't want to keep her from her life. Amelia was extremely relieved, as she loved Seattle as well. She compared it to her life in Los Angeles, where she would've had a six-hour conversation if she'd snapped at someone like she did at Meredith. She then revealed that her fights with James weren't about her leaving for Seattle; they were about her not wanting to ever leave again. After the surgery, she confided in Meredith that James is amazing and that he helped her through some stuff, but now she's on the other side and she - realizing it sounds horrible - doesn't need him anymore. She said that at the end of the night, after having no more way of avoiding it, she would call James and break his heart by telling him she couldn't do this anymore, knowing he deserves better.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\nNow that Amelia decided to stay in Seattle, Derek was ready to let her take over his service so he and Meredith could move to DC for his brain-mapping project. Amelia started taking over his service on a couple of days in the week, even though he occasionally would hover over her. After a day with a lot of trauma and not losing even one patient, Amelia told Meredith that she felt so, so good about the whole situation. She didn't care anymore that she was in Derek's shadow, although the only thing that could ever make her feel better was if his shadow were gone. She said it would be okay if he and Meredith were to move to DC and became happy there. However, Meredith decided to stay in Seattle, leaving Derek to choose between staying with his family in Seattle or pursuing his professional dreams.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter he decided to move to D.C., Amelia took over Derek's job as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Now permanently staying with her brother and sister-in-law, she witnessed their hour-long fight. She soon found her way to the AA meetings in Seattle, where she heard how Richard confessed that he had a daughter. She promised to keep his secret safe, as it was anonymous for a reason.<ref>[[I Must Have Lost It on the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia, being one of the few people to know about Richard's relation to Maggie, befriended her later when they worked together on a case of a young girl who suffered a stroke during sexual activity. Amelia especially loved the fact that Maggie referred to Derek as the other Dr. Shepherd, whereas it usually is the other way around. Amelia became kind of jealous of her patient, as it had been a long time since she'd had really great sex, or any sex at all, a feeling that Maggie recognized. This bonded them even more, causing Maggie to open up about her problems with Meredith. Amelia assured her that while it's hard to get to know Meredith at first, she genuinely is worth knowing.<ref>[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]], x</ref>\n\nHaving decided to stay in Seattle for his family, Derek couldn't help but interfere in Amelia's cases. She called him out on that and made it clear that she was now the Head of Neurosurgery. However, this didn't stop him from taking the lead on a case of hers, as he claimed it got too big for her and that he was the rightful leader of the department, having more experience on a higher level than she has. He operated on her patient behind her back, infuriating her upon finding out. She later had a talk with her brother, revealing that he was frustrated that Meredith indirectly made him feel obligated to stay. He'd never taken a step back in his career, which is why he tried to reclaim the leadership of the department. Amelia told him she recognized the feeling, as it was what he was doing to her. He assured her he hadn't done it intentionally. He was just trying to live with his choice, which Amelia pointed out she was doing too.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n\nFinding out that Maggie was going to quit, Amelia tried to stop her from doing so by getting Derek on a case with Maggie, urging them to talk. Maggie didn't bring up that Richard and Ellis are her biological parents, and Amelia didn't want to tell Derek herself as she found out in AA and promised Richard not to tell anyone. She did encourage Derek to talk to Meredith, but since they were fighting, Derek went to ask Maggie why Amelia wanted him to talk to his wife so badly. Maggie then revealed her secret.<ref>[[Only Mama Knows]], x</ref>\n\nFinally having found her footing, Amelia was thrown off when a woman she knew from Narcotics Anonymous spilled her addiction secrets at the hospital. Derek failed to support her and even gave Owen the idea to take her job. With everyone at the hospital gossiping about her, Amelia firmly stood by her right not to tell anyone more about her problems. While Derek convinced the board that Amelia was doing her job very well, Amelia found comfort with her sister-in-law Meredith. After going to a meeting, Amelia came home, telling Derek she'd move out the next day as she couldn't forgive him for not having her back from the beginning. He revealed he felt miserable and that he didn't know what to do with life anymore, always trying to do right by the people around him, but instead hurting them. She very well knew the feeling, that she named rock bottom.<ref>[[Could We Start Again, Please?]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and [[Nicole Herman]] became acquainted when they discovered they both knew Addison. They talked about Addison and her son Henry.<ref>[[Bend & Break]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Owen's relationship remained professional up until they experienced an emotional connection after Amelia confided in him about her past drug addiction. He, in return, gave a vague description about his past and told her that everyone's a risk and that everyone has something. Later, he asked her if she had people. She assured him that she did, and then asked him the same, telling him that if he ever needed someone, she was around.<ref>[[Risk]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, when Jackson and April were facing the loss of their son, Amelia sat in the chapel thinking about her own baby that she had lost. Owen entered the chapel and sat next to her. Looking at the lit candles in the front of the room, Amelia told Owen that her baby lived for  minutes. Owen took her hand, and the two shared a glance, before going back to watching the candles.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n\nAfter this emotional and very personal encounter, Amelia did not know how to act around Owen, perhaps realizing her attraction to him. The two shared awkward dialogue filled with fluster and stuttering. While she was in surgery, Amelia told Callie that when she used to be on drugs, she had \"such game.\" Now that she was off drugs, she had no game at all. Later, Amelia decided to go to Owen's trailer. She showed up with a bottle of sparkling water and quickly realized the awkwardness of her decision. She turned to leave and started walking away. Owen ran to her and told her to stop walking. When he reached her, he told her that he was gonna kiss her now, so she should stop talking. The two shared their first kiss.<ref>[[The Great Pretender]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Owen's mother, Evelyn, came to the hospital with her much younger boyfriend, Amelia bonded with his mother and told Owen that she liked her, calling her smart and funny, though Owen was upset by the situation. Amelia tried to get him to talk to her, but Owen told her to stay the hell out of it. She walked away. Later, as she was leaving the hospital, Owen ran up to her and apologized. He told her that he was sorry for the way he spoke to her, saying that he was out of line. Amelia responded with \"good,\" and turned to leave. Owen told her not to go, not like this, and said that the situation took him by surprise and that he was not always good with surprises. Amelia told him that she was not either and that maybe they should get over that. The two retreated to Owen's trailer and slept together.<ref>[[With or Without You]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia confessed to Derek that she thought she was falling in love with Owen and that she was afraid it would destroy her. Derek responded that it would not be love if it didn't.<ref>[[When I Grow Up]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Callie had difficulty agreeing on a surgical procedure for a patient. Owen came into the room when he heard them arguing, and each pitched her idea to him. He eventually sided with Amelia, and they used Amelia's idea on the patient. The surgery had a negative outcome and had a detrimental effect on the patient, and Amelia told Callie that they should have done it Callie's way in the beginning. Seeing that she was upset, Owen asked Amelia what the problem was. She accused him of only siding with her because of his personal feelings for her. Owen denied it, but she told him that this was why it isn't smart to mix personal and professional, saying that they were a mistake. Owen walked off. Later, Owen tried to get Amelia to tell him what was really going on because he wanted what they had started, but he needed a little help to do so. Amelia wanted to go somewhere to talk, but a phone call for her interfered.<ref>[[Crazy Love]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Amelia and Owen were caught in an elevator together. Owen told her that they both know that their relationship was more, but she told him that she didn't have any more to give. Owen said that he was done, and exited the elevator. Amelia stared after him. Amelia and Owen continued having inharmonious interactions, even getting into a heated argument in front of Edwards. Following this, Amelia told Owen that she was there, ready to talk, but he was pissed at her, so she was getting punished, referring to Owen's half-hearted and monosyllabic responses. She told him that this was unfair and pushed him into an on-call room. She told him that he was hardly being civil, and he sat on the bed and explained that the case they were working on together was bringing up guilty feelings about the plane crash that he caused, saying that he put them on the plane. Amelia sat next to him and took his hand. Owen told her that he wouldn't survive another plane crash, and that was all they were. Amelia let go of his hand and left the room.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia was one of the last people to speak to Derek before his fatal accident. She was in the OR as they were talking about his secret shortcut to the airport, but the connection got lost. Unknown to Amelia, that would be the last time she'd ever talk to her brother, as he later died at [[Dillard Medical Center]] after his car got hit by a truck.<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia was one of the last people to find out about Derek's death as hospital protocol dictated that she couldn't be informed during surgery. Callie, who heard before entering the OR, had to keep a straight face throughout the entire surgery. As soon as she was done, Owen asked to talk. She immediately recognized the face, having seen it before, and asked who died. He informed her it was Derek and started to tell the details, but she shut him up, not wanting to hear any more as dead was dead. She hardened herself and said she knew how to handle this, having gone through this before. The funeral passed and Amelia was left alone when Meredith left with her kids without saying where to, and Owen left for an army mission. Throughout the following weeks, Amelia made her colleagues uncomfortable with dark jokes about her brother's death. To distract herself from her true feelings, she buried herself in her work. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia yells at Richard.]] Months later, when Richard asked to have coffee together, she burst out, yelling that her time was crucial in order to save people so that her patients' families wouldn't need to lose their loved ones. She also yelled that she was saving lives, contrary to the doctors that failed to save her brother. At that exact time, Owen returned from his army mission. The confrontation embarrassed Amelia and led her to buy oxy from a junkie doctor. Pacing up and down the deck of the dream house, Amelia was doubting whether to take drugs again after , days of sobriety as Owen came to visit her. She said that she had it all managed, Derek's death and that she was fine, explaining she put on the mask of the funny girl to escape the pain. Owen managed to get through to her and said it was normal and human to let the pain and the grief in, to be completely destroyed. He also pointed out that she'd manage to build herself up again after this. Also, if she were going to take this bag of oxy, he knew it wouldn't be her last. Knowing this was true, she gave him the oxy and she broke down as she finally allowed herself to feel the pain she had been running away from for almost a year. Owen tightly hugged her as she cried.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia confronts Meredith.]]\n\nEventually, Meredith returned from San Diego with her new baby daughter, [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]]. Amelia helped her take care of the kids, but she resented Meredith for not having called her to the hospital before the plug was pulled on her brother. On top of that, Meredith decided to put out feelers for the house with a real estate agent without notifying Amelia. These feelings of anger and resentment came to the surface when Meredith wanted to give up on their patient during a field rotation. Amelia directly asked Meredith when she personally decided to give up on someone. Meredith apologized for the house situation and for leaving after Derek's death. Amelia says Meredith should have called her, as she might have been able to pull off a miracle to save Derek's life. Meredith again stated that it was too late back then. Amelia repeated Meredith should have called her, and she blurted out that Meredith was the reason that she didn't get to say goodbye to her brother. After having said this, Amelia left, after which Meredith broke down crying.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|An emotional Amelia after hearing Derek's voice mail message.]] \nThis made Meredith realize she hadn't been a good sister to Amelia and as a peace offering, she gave Amelia her old phone, which contained a voice mail message from Derek from the day he died. Later, at Richard and Catherine's wedding party, Owen found Amelia sitting in Meredith's bedroom by herself with the phone in her hands. Amelia informed him about the message and that she couldn't get herself to hit play. Owen sat down and hit play for her. He then wanted to give her privacy to hear Derek's words, but she grabbed his hand to make him stay. While hearing Derek talk about his plans for his family and the ferry boat, Amelia got emotional. The message made her forgive Meredith and Amelia sat down with her and Maggie on the deck. Seeing everyone happy and dancing in the living room, Meredith told them that it was Derek's wish to fill the house with noise and people, so she wanted this to be her last memory of the house. Meredith noticed the two women were in need of dancing it out, so she took their hands and dragged them inside to do so.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlthough Amelia and Owen did not have an established romantic relationship, they continued with an amicable one. On the porch of Meredith's house, which Amelia shared with her and Maggie, she was telling Owen that she did not want to go inside, referring to the tension between her and Meredith. She continued to talk, and Owen kissed her mid-sentence.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nFollowing the kiss, Amelia was confused about the nature of her relationship with Owen, telling Maggie and Meredith that she thought they were just friends. Amelia and Owen continued throughout the day with awkward encounters, only speaking directly on one occasion. Later, they were again caught in an elevator together. Owen stopped the elevator and asked her why she wouldn't talk to him, and she told him that she was confused. Owen said they should talk about it, and Amelia agreed. The two shared a passionate kiss.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia tried to get Owen to open up to her about his problems with Riggs, but he told her that he was not like her and didn't need to talk everything to death. He said to listen to the words he was saying and that he didn't want her help, not with this. He stormed away angrily. Later, Amelia went to a bar, and Riggs bought her a drink, leading up to her relapse.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nAfter getting sober and earning her -day chip, Amelia and Owen went back to having an amicable, platonic relationship. After learning that Amelia had been sleeping at the hospital since being kicked out of Meredith's home, he told her that she could always stay with him. Amelia said it wouldn't be a good idea for her sobriety, but that she was going to need dinner. They agreed to get dinner that night. Later, when they were supposed to leave, Owen, who was upset due to another confrontation with Riggs asked her if they could do it another night. She said okay, but that she didn't know how to do this thing he did where he made her feel like crap even though there were no words coming out of his mouth. She said that he'd call her, maybe or maybe not, and maybe she would not care. She turned to leave and started walking, but Owen stopped her by telling her that he had a sister. Owen gave her a vague reason of why he had such an issue with Riggs. Amelia gave him some advice, and then they went to get dinner.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter spending a night with Owen, Amelia told him the next day that it was wrong of her to come over, saying that she should not be starting anything new. She continued to tell him that she screwed everything up and that she didn't want him to be one of those things. Later, in an on-call room, Owen told her they are not starting anything new. He said that if they wanted to start a clean slate, they could do that, but they should do it. They agreed to start over.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia knocked on the door of Owen's trailer, as they were supposed to be eating dinner together because his birthday was approaching. Owen opened the door, very obviously drunk because of another confrontation with Riggs. Owen was stumbling around and muttering, and Amelia said that she was going to go, knowing that because of all the alcohol that is around, being around Owen at the moment could compromise her sobriety. She ran from the trailer, crying.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Amelia didn't see Owen until later, having taken the day off work. That night, he approached her on the front porch of Meredith's house and apologized, telling her that it wouldn't happen again. She told him that she appreciated his words, but that she couldn't count on them, saying that she could only count on herself and so she couldn't do that with him right now, and maybe not ever. She asked him to leave.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Owen continued with a professional, but friendly relationship. In the attendings' lounge, Owen confessed to Amelia that it was his fault that his sister boarded the helicopter that she disappeared on. Amelia hugged him, telling him that he didn't mean to.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith, Maggie, and the kids walked in on Amelia and Owen naked on the couch. In the car, Meredith and Maggie teased her, but Amelia told them she and Owen could not be in a relationship. At the end of the day, as the three were leaving the hospital, Meredith told Amelia that she had happiness, but she kept throwing it away. She told her to stop the drama and get on with it already. Amelia turned around and started running. She took a cab to Owen's trailer, and told him that they were not the kind of people who say \"I love you.\" She said that a relationship with him would be messy and scary, but it was harder to love someone than to walk away from them. Owen told her that if they were to be together, he would end up screwing all of it up. Amelia said that she would, too. Owen took her hand and said, \"let's screw some things up,\" and then kissed her.<ref>[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]], x</ref>\n\n\nNot long after deciding to be a couple for real, Amelia and Owen began to have hypothetical discussions about weddings, kids, and a life together. After Owen bought a house of his own and implied that Amelia was welcome to move in with him, she ended up proposing to him, wanting to move from merely talking about their future to actually building their life together. He said yes.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia walks down the aisle.]]\nNow engaged, the couple quickly began to plan their wedding. Two weeks later, on the day of her wedding, Amelia phoned her mother only to find out that neither she nor any of her sisters were going to attend the ceremony, believing it to be just another rushed decision and even doubting Amelia's sobriety. Her family's betrayal left Amelia devastated and she began to doubt whether she was doing the right thing after all. Her doubts were only amplified upon overhearing Meredith discussing Cristina with Owen, and before long, Amelia was escaping her own wedding with Meredith and Maggie. After taking her time to freak out and sort her thoughts, however, Amelia decided to go back to Owen, who had patiently been waiting for her and ended up walking down the aisle after all.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> After the ceremony, she and Owen danced all night at their reception.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tries to fix Owen and Nathan's friendship.]]\nSoon after the wedding, she moved into Owen's house. The wedding photographer asked them to choose their favorite pictures and seeing Owen and Nathan happy at the wedding, she secretly invited Nathan for dinner. While working with Jo, she was confronted with how Jo's life had fallen apart and invited her as well. That night, Maggie and Meredith also showed up as Owen had urged them to come so he wouldn't have to talk to Nathan. During the party, she noticed that despite some effort, things would remain awkward between Owen and Nathan and she decided to give. After all the guests had gone home, Amelia sat down with Owen and showed him a picture of him and Nathan. She explained she's a fixer and urged him to attempt to fix things with Nathan so they could again be as close and happy as they once were.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Amelia enjoyed married life and the sex that comes with it, Maggie and Meredith began to fight as the latter refused to listen to Maggie talking about Nathan. Maggie confided to Amelia that it seemed to annoy Meredith, so Amelia went to tell Meredith that she should listen to Maggie as a good sister would.<ref>[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tries to get to know Owen better.]]\nUpon discovering that Owen goes to church, Amelia realized that there was so much they didn't know about each other as they rushed into marriage. In the process, she jokingly said she couldn't have kids with someone she barely knew. She found it scary not to know everything as some things might scare the other one. He questioned how bad it could be, leading her to walk away. That night, she opened up to him about [[Ryan Kerrigan|Ryan's]] death. He then told her about his choking Cristina and assured her their kids would be just fine. She told him she couldn't wait to have kids, to which he replied they didn't need to wait.<ref>[[Falling Slowly]], x</ref>\n\nTwo months after the wedding, Amelia was late and immediately thought she was pregnant. She confided in Meredith as she caught Amelia looking for a pregnancy test in the supply closet. As she went to talk to Owen, she was interrupted by Jackson, who handed Harriet to Owen. Amelia then decided to talk to him later. Maggie and April found out before Amelia actually took the test, which she hesitated to do as she didn't know how to tell Owen. She told April that last time she was pregnant, she didn't have to tell the father as he had died. Amelia then took the test home and told Owen that she might be pregnant. She then actually took the test. While waiting for the result, Owen already started to talk about a nursery. However, the test was negative. Owen told Amelia that they had just started and that they could keep trying.<ref>[[Both Sides Now]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Amelia was secretly relieved. She snuck out in the morning and worked all day while Owen attempted to talk to her. She finally told him that she was fine with not being pregnant. She figured they could enjoy being newlyweds before adding pressure by trying to have kids. He agreed if that's what she wanted. After losing a young boy, an emotional Amelia confided in Alex and told him about her baby boy, including the fact that nobody in her family knew the whole story. She admitted she was afraid Owen would hate her if he found out because he wanted a family so bad. Alex doubted that and advised her to tell Owen. Owen later asked her to grab dinner together, but she declined to avoid him.<ref>[[Roar]], x</ref>\n\nTo avoid talking to Owen, she took case after case and didn't come home for two weeks. This led to a lot of friction between the two. The arguing continued over a case until Amelia finally admitted that she didn't want to have a baby. After the ensuing fight, she went to Meredith's and asked for a place to sleep. Alex first told her no so she would have to fix her crap, but then offered her his room upon hearing that she had finally told Owen.<ref>[[Why Try to Change Me Now]], x</ref> They continued to live apart for a while. Amelia briefly returned home when she decided to leave Owen. She left him a note asking him not to make this his fault, knowing that that is what he does.<ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\nFiguring that Owen would look for her at Meredith's, she went to stay with Stephanie and ignored Owen's calls as she took a few days leave. While Stephanie asked her to at least let her tell Owen something, Amelia said no because then Owen would want to fix the situation while it couldn't be fixed. Behind Amelia's back, Stephanie did tell Owen that she was safe and sober.<ref>[[Jukebox Hero]], x</ref> Owen showed up at Stephanie's and asked Amelia to open the door because it would only get harder to open the door the longer she stayed inside. Since Amelia didn't respond, Owen asked Stephanie to let her know that he was done waiting.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref> Amelia then moved back to Meredith's house, where Alex offered her his bed. She spent a lot of her time off sleeping.<ref>[[Back Where You Belong]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie requested Amelia return to work briefly to clip her patient's aneurysm. Longing to operate again, Amelia agreed if Maggie made sure Owen wouldn't see her. After the surgery, she made her way out through the ER and decided to step in when Owen's incoming patient needed neuro. While getting the patient into surgery, she admitted to Owen why she was there and that she had planned to avoid him. After surgery, Owen asked her if she wanted to be married to him. She assured him she did, but she was not ready to have the inevitable fight. While Owen decided to let it slide, Amelia told Maggie she knew they had to talk soon.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n\nAs soon as she fully returned to work, Owen tried to talk again. As she didn't respond, he told her to figure out what she wanted. When he approached her after a successful surgery, she lashed out and told him she felt bullied and suffocated by him and his wants and needs, even going as far as throwing Cristina in his face. They continued in the stairwell, where she asked him why he wanted a baby so bad. He wanted a family, but she said the two of them were also a family. He found it normal to have children, but she disagreed. Having children might be wonderful, but it might also be terrible and you cannot know what you'll be given. He told her she'd be an amazing mother. She reminded him she already was a mother, for better and for worse. Her own experience with motherhood in mind, she wanted to know if he had also thought about the fact that having a child could be painful instead of wonderful. He didn't reply and she made it clear that life doesn't play by normal rules, and neither does a marriage that lasts.<ref>[[Till I Hear It From You]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia supports Maggie.]]\nThe confrontation led to the two of them giving each other space, giving Amelia time to support Maggie and her mother when the latter started her cancer treatment and stayed with the sisters.<ref>[[Be Still, My Soul]], x</ref> Amelia continued to support and comfort Maggie after her mother passed away. When Owen's pregnant friend was admitted, Amelia didn't visit her and her husband because they were Owen's friends from before she came along.<ref>[[What's Inside]], x</ref> Their love for each other lingered, as Owen briefly hugged Amelia when she was emotional after losing [[Veronica Kays|a new mother]] on the table. To take her mind off the case, Amelia went out with Meredith and Maggie.<ref>[[Don't Stop Me Now]], x</ref> After Meredith got rid of Derek's tumor drawing and gave it to Amelia, Maggie and Amelia discussed how Meredith had decided to move on from Derek and how she was clearing a path for Nathan, which they decided to support.<ref>[[Leave It Inside]], x</ref> She calmed Meredith down when she started to freak out over having invited Nathan to meet her kids.\n\n\nAt work, Amelia noticed some strange behavior from Owen. When she went to check on him, he revealed the Army came to his house to inform him that his sister Megan had been found alive in a basement in a rebel-led neighborhood. Since he doubted it was really Megan, Amelia took Owen to Meredith's house and made calls to ensure it was Megan. She ended up talking to [[Teddy Altman]], who assured her it was Megan and arranged a transfer to Grey Sloan. She also called a PTSD expert for Owen and held him while he cried over having given up on his sister. When Meredith came home, Amelia told her the news, after which Meredith took off to go tell Nathan.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> When an explosion at the hospital rendered the helipad unavailable, Amelia and Owen drove all the way up to Madigan. During the trip, Owen opened up about Megan's positive disposition and how he didn't know what to say to her now. She calmly told him he would once he'd see her. They were welcomed at Madigan by a Lieutenant and a Colonel and received instructions on how to talk to Megan. They were then taken outside in time to see the helicopter land. As Megan was unloaded, Owen held Amelia's hand.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia kept her distance from Megan and Owen while they reunited, but kept doing so once Megan was transferred to Grey Sloan. She chose to focus on a difficult case instead and never checked in with Megan or Owen. This led to Teddy confronting her about it, but Amelia lashed out in return and entirely dedicated herself to the difficult surgery.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref> She continued to do her best to get Jackson to consent to operate with her, fearing the patient might become addicted to pain meds if she were to send him home. When Owen finally came to see her himself, he brought up that nobody in his life saw her as the great person he knew her as and that their perspective made him think something was wrong with her. She again lashed out and told him to be with Teddy if that was what he wanted. She managed to remove the difficult tumor albeit by forcing Jackson to help her put the boy's jaw back together. While Jackson thought she got lucky, she credited her own skills. In a mood to celebrate, she volunteered for Carina DeLuca's orgasm study. However, that mood quickly vanished when the MRI showed a -centimeter tumor in her frontal lobe.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nShe kept her tumor a secret for a week and studied her scans with only [[Andrew DeLuca|Andrew]] in the know. She flew in [[Tom Koracick|Dr. Tom Koracick]], her former mentor, to operate on her. He studied the scans and forbade her from treating patients as her decision making was and had been impaired for years. Amelia confided in Richard and then went back over past cases of hers to decide if her decisions were indeed reckless. She started spiraling until Richard showed proof that her mortality rate was better than Derek's, thus evidencing that she hadn't hurt anyone. He also made her realize she was hurting the people she loves by not letting them be there for her. She first told Maggie and asked her to help tell Owen and Meredith, who had been telling her she was crazy for years. More than anything, she hated that Meredith turned out to be right. While Maggie told Meredith, Amelia paged Owen to the tech room to show him her scans. While initially came to yell at her for her behavior, he calmed down upon learning the news and helped her get admitted. Meredith came by and climbed into bed with her to comfort her.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia shaves off her hair in preparation for the surgery.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells her loved ones that she loves them before her surgery.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Tom examines Amelia post-op.]]\nTom planned the surgery to remove the benign grade I meningioma. While it was a fairly simple surgery, Amelia chose April as her proxy in case things went wrong since they weren't too close for emotions to cloud April's judgment. She told her loved ones she loved them tremendously and was taken to the OR. After doing the superhero pose with the surgical team, Amelia was put under.  hours post-op, Amelia woke up unable to speak, which made her think she was gorked. Throughout the first day, she was extubated but desired to sleep more than anything else. Per her own instructions, Andrew put her through her own early mobilization protocol despite Tom's objections. Richard came by in the evening to suggests pain meds, but he also knew she'd resist given her addiction to opioids, a message she was able to convey with a pained look in her eyes.\n\nThe next day, Amelia started talking but in French, a skill she was unaware of but capable of due to her having attended a French preschool. That evening, with Owen and Meredith present, she regained her ability to speak English. While she did not remember having spoken French, she did remember the tumor and the surgery. Owen wanted to call Koracick, but Amelia asked for Derek instead. Her mistake prompted them to have a head CT taken. Amelia forgot Derek died but it came back the instant they told her. She initially feared her memory loss would prevent her from operating ever again, but Tom made her realize that it was very likely temporary.\n\nOn the fourth day post-op, Tom deemed her capable of going home. Her motor and memory skills were good and her scans looked pristine. While her loved ones were relieved, Amelia herself thought they were missing something and demanded to see the scans. She studied the scans with Tom and Andrew and found they were clean. However, she ordered more tests. While she wasn't sure what she was looking for, she was sure she'd recognize it once they found it. Instead, Andrew returned to her room with her tumor in a jar. He figured that she was waiting for the other shoe to drop. He told her that for the first time in years, she was finally safe and that she probably misinterpreted that as feeling like something's wrong. She hugged him and accepted she was fine. That night, Owen came to pick her up from her room to take her home. She told him he didn't need to do that since she knew he was coming to end things with her when she told him about the tumor. He married a tumor and she didn't know who she was anymore without it. However, he said she was his wife in sickness and in health and drove her home.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nShe recovered at home with Owen, Megan, and Farouk. Megan, Farouk, and Nathan decided to move to Los Angeles so Megan could live by the beach. Owen decided to drive Megan out there with the last of her stuff and fly back afterward. When he came home, she immediately realized that he now did want to end their marriage. He told her they didn't know each other and that they weren't happy like they were supposed to. She agreed and told him it was okay. They returned their rings and hugged.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x</ref>\n\nOn her first day back, she found herself to be nervous and dropped by Owen's house to collect her notes from medical school, which comfort her. They agreed they made the right decision to split, even though their love and affection for one another remained. They decided to blame all the bad on the tumor and become close friends. While Tom officially handed her service back to her, she asked him to scrub in with her on her first patient back. When she and Tom disagreed over the approach, she paged Richard and told him that she had no idea what kind of surgeon she was without the tumor, much like how you have to figure out again who you are after you become sober. He advised her to take it one surgery at a time and assured her that the tumor did not define her. The surgery went well and she regained her confidence when she quickly stopped an unexpected bleed. Afterward, Tom admitted that she was a better surgeon than him, which led to the two of them having sex despite her disliking him.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nAfter that first patient, Amelia returned to running her own service. She walked in on Owen and Carina when she came to collect a few more things from the house. She then returned her key to him.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref> Later, Amelia and Alex were working on a case together when the hospital was cyber-attacked by hackers. With all charts down, they did not know whether their patient, who was showing signs of a stroke, had been given vitamin K already or not. That left them to gamble whether or not it was safe to administer heparin, which might cause a brain bleed if Frankie had not been given vitamin K yet. Based on his history, they suspected an ischemic stroke and administered the heparin.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> That was the wrong decision, but they caught the brain bleed in time and Amelia managed to fix it.<ref>[[---]], x</ref> Amelia later also treated [[Paul Stadler]], Jo's abusive (ex-)husband, who had a concussion and ended up braindead after hitting his head again when he launched himself at Jo to attack her and slipped.<ref>[[Personal Jesus]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia recruited [[Andrew DeLuca]] and [[Sam Bello]] to do research for five different projects Amelia had in mind for the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. When she and Alex discovered that their patient [[Kimmie Park]] had an inoperable tumor, she instructed Andrew and Sam to drop all the viability studies and look into ways they could remove Kimmie's tumor. However, it was Amelia herself who was inspired to use MRI-guided ultrasound ablation, which she then submitted as her official project for the contest with Alex as her co-author. Unfortunately, Amelia and Alex's project did not make it to round two of the contest, leaving them without a viable treatment plan for Kimmie.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Alex tried to figure out the ultrasound ablation on their own without success, as their approach only led to frying tissue. Amelia brought in Tom to help out, though they planned to keep him away from Kimmie. However, Andrew accidentally sent him to her and she and Tom actually bonded over musicals. Now understanding the rush behind the project, Tom was afraid they would not be successful in time for Kimmie. Amelia insisted they could make it work and as they argued over it, Tom thought of the option to use multiple beams from different angles. While still not perfect, the first test run seemed promising enough to warrant further exploration.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nOverhearing Maggie and her date Clive having sex at the house, Amelia realized she missed sex and came up with the idea of a game night so the sisters could judge Clive. Throughout the day, she realized her attraction to Owen's authoritative behavior in the ER. Meanwhile, Alex wanted to use marijuana oil on Kimmie and asked Amelia to convince Kimmie's reluctant grandmother. Amelia preferred not to disclose her personal history. That was the first time Tom found out about her addiction history and found himself aroused by her dark side. At the same time, Amelia urged Sam and Andrew to confess their feelings for one another as their pretending not to be in love was the only thing that made them \"bad for each other.\" Inspired by her own advice, Amelia gave in to her desire for Owen and asked if he was open to give her sex, as he was her most appealing option. He happily accepted.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref> Their new arrangement continued with Owen regularly staying over at the house. Amelia found it was the perfect way to take the edge off.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nOver time, Owen questioned if she was okay with their arrangement as he was waiting for the other shoe to drop, like the time she went back and forth about wanting kids. She told him that was the tumor and added that she never cheated despite the tumor. Owen admitted he felt like the kiss with Teddy wasn't really cheating because she told him to go to Teddy and Teddy was there for him while Amelia wasn't. Amelia then realized their marriage never stood a chance and told Owen that Teddy was his tumor. She explained he was never with Teddy, so she was like a benign tumor, but she was always there, quietly growing, so not really benign. Amelia then told Owen Teddy only rejected him because he was married at the time, but now he was single and there was nothing stopping him from telling Teddy how he felt. Throughout the Teddy, Amelia and Alex also checked up on [[Noah Brosniak]], a kid with a benign tumor causing seizures, and found him to be a perfect candidate for their project as there was no other treatment option.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|A worried Amelia waits for Noah to wake up.]]\nOwen returned from Germany after Teddy threw him out upon finding out that he came there after Amelia told him to within  hours of having had sex with her. Amelia reached out to Teddy to explain things on his behalf, but Teddy made it clear she was not interested. The same day, a nervous Alex and Amelia prepared Noah for the risky procedure. She and Andrew did the superhero pose beforehand. They used a helmet with microphones to listen for popping sounds, which would indicate Noah's brain was melting. With no place for the heat to disperse, they had to stop frequently to let the tissue cool down. They completed the procedure, after which Amelia threw up. Post-op, Amelia was overcome by guilt for putting Noah through the risky procedure when he didn't wake up for a long time, but he did eventually and showed no more seizures. However, because of the risk involved and Kimmie's case being even more difficult, the doctors decided against using the procedure on Kimmie and instead set up a treatment regimen with chemo and radiation for her. The experience made Amelia crave a drink, so Richard took her to his hospitalized's sponsor's room and they held a meeting.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n\nAlex refused to give up on Kimmie, so Amelia reached out to [[Rebecca Froy]], a doctor in Chicago doing similar research. She had a Skype interview with Rebecca and they set up to meet in Washington. However, as soon as Amelia mentioned that the Harper Avery Foundation would cover expenses, Rebecca backed out. She reached out again with Jackson to find out what the problem was, but Rebecca only said she legally wasn't allowed to talk about it and hang up again. The event set off the Harper Avery sexual harassment scandal, putting the Foundation and all of its hospitals in peril.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile the hospital dealt with employees who got high on cannabis cookies, Amelia received a call from a stressful Owen, who was assigned a foster baby boy and was not prepared to take care of a newborn. Amelia then came over to help while also taking a high Alex with her since he was playing with expensive equipment in her lab. While Owen took a shower, Amelia cleaned the house in preparation for the social worker's visit. When the social worker arrived, Amelia gave Owen a pep-talk while Alex let the social worker and baby [[Leo Hunt|Leo]] in. Alex then claimed he came to check on the kid as a pediatric surgeon. The drop-off went well and Amelia then decided to go pick up stuff at Meredith's as they couldn't be seen with Alex in public. While they gathered the stuff, Amelia once again assured Owen that what he was doing was beautiful. They took care of Alex and Leo together for the rest of the day until Jo came to pick up Alex. Amelia decided to stay for the night when Leo had difficulties sleeping.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia was there when Owen brought Leo by the hospital for his six-month check-up. They arranged for [[Betty Nelson|Betty]], Leo's birth mother, to meet them there. During the exam, Amelia noticed how Betty cringed when Arizona gave Leo a shot, so they waited together in the hallway for a bit and then went to get some food. Privately, Amelia asked how long she had been using and told her she recognized the signs of drug use, revealing her own struggles with sobriety. Betty admitted she had been using since she was prescribed opioids after surgery to repair a torn ACL and told Amelia that Leo's father was her drug dealer. Amelia then got the idea to take Betty in and help her stay sober. She talked it over with Richard, who encouraged her and said it could save Betty's life. She met up with the social worker, who thought it was unconventional but didn't see a problem. Amelia then told Owen, who offered to let the two of them stay with him as having Leo around would be an encouragement for Betty to stay sober. Amelia presented the offer, who ended up accepting. Amelia then set ground rules: no drugs, obligatory meetings, and contacting her parents to let them know she was safe. The new-found family then all went home together.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia took some time off work to help Betty get through the worst stages of withdrawal. Betty lashed out several times, but Amelia knew that that last high was a demon dying a painful death and pushing her away to stay alive and she called herself the exorcist. Later, Amelia wanted to change Betty's fluids but found that she had escaped through the bathroom window. Distraught, she attended a meeting and talked about this epidemic of doctors who write these prescriptions that ruin good kids in an attempt to help.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nA couple of days later, Betty returned to the house. Amelia came over and Betty told her that she left to get high but was unsuccessful, after which she squatted on a friend's couch. She claimed she had come back because she missed Leo. Amelia then decided to take Betty to work so she could keep an eye on her. She left Betty on a seat outside the room while she and Arizona saw [[Nicole Herman]], who had been having headaches and dizziness. Believing the tumor was back, Amelia decided to tell Nicole about her own as keeping that secret would endanger her sobriety. However, the cause of Nicole's problems turned out to be a spinal fluid leak.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia finds out that Nicole already knows about her tumor through Tom.]]\nAmelia was pulled onto April's case to watch over her as she recovered from the hypothermia but she pulled through without deficits. Amelia then went to tell Nicole that she needed a shunt. She wanted her to go to Tom Koracick for it, but Nicole wanted her to do it instead because she went to see Tom after Amelia had removed her tumor. She and Tom also slept together and she overheard a phone call of his where he talked about Amelia's tumor, so Nicole already knew about the tumor that made crazy enough to tackle hers. Amelia left the room to make an angry phone call to Tom. She then went to take Betty home with her. Betty confessed she actually did get high, but Amelia already knew. She took Betty to a meeting. <ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Amelia's feelings for one another are re-kindled as they watch Alex and Jo's wedding with Betty.]]\nA month later, on the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Amelia invited Betty's parents to celebrate her earning her  days chip, but they didn't show. Betty accompanied them to the wedding. Throughout the day, Amelia suggested that Meredith had feelings for Alex, but Meredith pointed out she was just projecting because she was starting to have feelings for Owen again now that they were playing house. Amelia helped to look for Alex when he and Jo went missing. When the wedding was called off due to several things going wrong, Amelia, Owen, Betty, and Leo joined the other guests on the ferry back to the city, where Meredith officiated an impromptu wedding for Jo and Alex.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia's new family life hit a snag when Teddy returned to Seattle without informing Owen. They ran into each other at the hospital and Teddy briefly mentioned the interim Chief position. Amelia wondered if he was still hung up on her and then went to Bailey's office to make a case for her to be appointed interim Chief, stating that she was very dedicated to her work and questioning what Teddy had that she hadn't. She later talked it over with Tom while they continued to work on their ultrasound ablation project. He told her she was not a victim in her marriage. She had been an ass to Owen to the point that Tom didn't realize they were married when they had sex after removing the tumor. Tom told her to fight for Owen as you never just get things worth having without fighting for them, citing letting his wife leave him as an example. He told her it was anti-Amelia not to fight for what you want, not anti-feminist. That night at Owen's, Amelia told Owen that she had feelings for him again and that she couldn't forgive herself if her hiding her feelings would make him chase after Teddy. Owen says Teddy accused him of being unable to be alone and that he did not want her to be right, after which he kissed Amelia.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nThey wanted to have sex, but Leo and Betty waking up prevented them from doing so. Amelia then went home and told her sisters what happened. Owen and Amelia basked in their newfound happiness while they worked a case together, while Maggie and intern Casey had just learned about Teddy's pregnancy with Owen's child. Amelia encouraged Meredith to hire [[Cece Colvin|a matchmaker]] to get to the blissful place of dating where she and Owen were. Their patient had a motorcycle accident while not wearing a helmet, which led Owen to realize that he and Amelia were reckless last time they were together, which they couldn't afford to do again now that they had to provide a stable environment for Leo and Betty. They met up after work and he stated he wanted all the strings, but she was reluctant because addicts have a certain wariness of change and commitment. However, she did promise to try and be less wary so they could be together and provide stability at home.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nThey quickly became accustomed to family life and Amelia officially declared herself off the dating market to her sisters, though she did admit that Link gave her \"pants feelings\" when they ran into him. Maggie then nudged Link in her direction in an attempt to minimize the damage that Teddy's still-secret pregnancy would cause. When Tom also flirted with her over their research, she started to wonder why everyone was so against her and Owen. Maggie later apologized for the way she behaved towards Amelia and Owen, after which Amelia comforted Maggie over Jackson's sudden departure. Afterwards, Amelia assured Owen that Maggie's thing was not about the two of them and they went to pick up the kids to go home.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia kept guarding over Betty's sobriety and confronted her when she suspected Betty had slipped, which led to an argument between the two. Amelia decided to ground her and took her to the hospital for a tox screen, unbeknownst to Betty. When she found out, she left to go spend time with Leo in daycare. While watching her, Amelia admitted she had no idea how to discipline a teenager as her mother just let her do whatever she wanted after her father died. Owen said his mother was the opposite, which led to Amelia calling her for advice. Evelyn told her that children inevitably sail away from their parents and it's the parents' job to build them a boat strong enough to safely return when they feel like it. Betty later confessed that she smoked some weed. Amelia knew that she knew there was nothing like \"just weed\" for an addict and grounded Betty for a month.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nGiven Betty's recent slip and her own history of playing hooky, Amelia wanted to make sure that Betty wouldn't ditch school to get a fix, so she and Owen hung out around Betty's school. She told Owen about the time she got alcohol poisoning at the age of  in the middle of a school day. Owen brought up apps to track kids' phones and texts, which Amelia already installed to spy on Betty, which was how she had found out about a plan to cut class today. Owen found that to be obsessive, so she had him delete the apps from her phone. After a few hours, the school VP came to check who they were and then asked them to move. Not long after, they caught Betty and two friends trying to sneak out, so Owen alerted her to their presence to make her go back. He then decided they would stick around for the rest of the day. They spent time playing with a paper fortune teller and while changing Leo, Amelia talked about how taking care of Betty and Leo made her realize that no kid could ever lessen her memories of her first son, Christopher, whose name she had never been able to say out loud out of fear of falling apart. Betty got in their car after her school day, frustrated that they had camped out there all day. That night, Amelia dropped by Meredith's house to pick up some things as she had decided to stay at Owen's a little longer than anticipated. Unbeknownst to her, Teddy had spent the entire day at Meredith's while discussing her pregnancy and plans for the future with Meredith.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy came by the house to finally tell Owen about her pregnancy, but before she could do so, Amelia returned from daycare with the news that Betty had disappeared from school. The three of them spread out in the city to look for her, including amongst unhoused teenagers in the park, and reconvened at the house with no result. They opted against calling the police because Betty wasn't a regular teenager. Amelia herself once disappeared and the police found her about to jump off her friend's roof high on pills. Owen took Amelia to a meeting while Teddy stayed behind in case Betty returned. Later that night, Betty still hadn't returned, making Amelia fear that she was dead. Owen took her in his arms and comforted her.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWith a windstorm approaching Seattle, Owen and Amelia headed into work and dropped Leo off at daycare. While Amelia was treating [[Phoebe Moss]], Amelia saw Betty walk down the hallway. She had a head lac from being hit by a tree branch, but she was otherwise fine. Amelia wanted a tox screen but Betty honestly admitted to being high. Amelia reminded Owen to tell the nurses that Betty's an addict and headed into surgery. Amelia lost her patient in surgery. While things were arranged for Phoebe to be an organ donor for [[Cece Colvin]], Amelia had to call Phoebe's mother and tell her the bad news. Afterwards, Amelia went to hug Betty and told her that she always could and should come back. \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells Owen about her plan to become Betty's official foster mother.]]\nAmelia then went looking for Owen and eventually ended up on an elevator with him, Teddy, and a trauma patient. As she told Owen that she wanted to apply to become Betty's official foster mother, she noticed some tension between the other two. She asked what was going on as the power died, trapping the four of them in an elevator.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia gives Owen time to consider his options.]]\nThe power kicked back in soon, but for some reason, the elevator remained stuck. Owen then revealed to her that Teddy was pregnant and she realized the child was his. While Teddy and Owen worked to stabilize the patient, Teddy told Owen that the two of them getting together was off the table, so he was free to be with Amelia. She just wanted to stay in Seattle so their child would have two parents and she would have her friend. They rushed out to an OR as soon as the elevator started working again. After saving the patient, Owen found Amelia and told her that Teddy's pregnancy didn't change anything, but she disagreed. She knew his history with Teddy and told him she was giving him time to consider all of his options. Later, Amelia heard from Richard that Betty had been looking for drugs in the hospital, making Amelia realize that she could no longer help Betty on her own. She booked a bed in a rehab center and made the offer to Betty, who accepted.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nWith Betty gone, Amelia dedicated all her energy towards finding a treatment plan for Catherine with Tom. She overheard Owen fighting with Teddy where he yelled that if she had been upfront right when she returned, he wouldn't be in this crap situation. Owen tried to explain his comment to Amelia, but Tom threw him out of the lab so they could focus on Catherine's case. They tried some approaches through VR glasses but none of them worked. Jo brought salvation when she informed them of a new type of visualization that they could use in surgery. Owen caught up with Amelia as she was heading out and told him that even though he was expecting a baby with Teddy, he also had a real family with Amelia and he didn't want to do anything of it without her. He told her he was choosing her, so they went home together.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nThe day finally arrived for Catherine's surgery. Amelia was nervous to operate on a surgical legend and did the superhero pose to gain confidence. Her and Tom's surgical plan had to be abandoned when they found that the tumor was too dense and too attached to the brachial plexus to remove it entirely without compromising motor function and thus Catherine's career. They opted to leave a small part behind, meaning Catherine would have to live with cancer. Catherine, however, was glad that they managed to give her her life back and accepted the outcome. That night, Amelia and Richard went to a meeting and she talked about how glad she was to be sober to experience a high like this, derived from giving Catherine her career and life back and saving her loved ones from losing her.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nWith the holidays approaching, Owen and Amelia decided to do Christmas presents at home instead of Meredith's so they could establish normalcy and traditions with Leo. Amelia visited Betty in rehab and told her that Leo was teething, but Betty told her that she didn't miss Leo as much as she did drugs, adding that she was still a kid of her own and shouldn't be a mother. The holidays passed and the visits continued. One time, Owen accompanied her and they saw Linus, a boy Betty had met there. During their talk, Betty came clean as part of the -step program and told them that her name was actually Britney and that she had run away from her parents, who don't know about Leo. She asked them not to call her parents as she feared they might take Leo away. That night at home, Owen tried to find Betty's real parents, but Amelia thought there was no point and that it was Betty's choice to make. He was angry at Betty for lying to her and didn't accept Amelia's explanation that it was part of the disease. He lashed out and said the addiction was just an excuse for piss-poor life choices. Hurt over his comment, she prepared to leave, but he apologized and said he was afraid of losing Leo. On Valentine's Day, Owen apologized for being an ass with a bouquet.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells Owen that Betty's parents have surfaced.]]\nSometime after, Amelia received a call from the rehab center that Betty had run off. As she was leaving the hospital, she was approached by Betty's real parents. Betty had called them from rehab two days ago, but when they arrived there today, they were told she had run off and they directed them to Amelia as Betty's legal guardian. Amelia explained the whole situation to them and then went to inform Owen about their arrival. Together, they took John and Carol to go see their grandson in daycare. Owen grew uneasy as they compared him to baby Betty, so he left. While John was off to find a hotel, Amelia talked with Carol. She recalled how terrified she was when Betty first ran off and said she couldn't imagine feeling that way for a year and a half. Carol said she was a good mother and talked about how the drugs ruined her little girl. She didn't understand how Britney could call her and then run off. Amelia shared her own history of drug abuse and shared how shame made her avoid her mother when she got clean. She promised Carol her little girl was still in there.\n\nHowever, Carol told John and they decided to take Leo with them that night, refusing to leave Leo with another addict. Owen said he was Leo's legal guardian, forcing them to leave without their grandson. Afterward, he yelled at Amelia for giving them information that they could use to take Leo away from him. Amelia said they weren't married, so she wasn't standing in the way of his fighting for Leo if he wanted to do that. He got mad that she used \"if\" but she pointed out that he was just Leo's foster father and that Leo's family had returned. She added he didn't even seem to care about Leo's mother being missing, but Owen said Betty was never a real mother.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, they arranged for Betty's parents to come pick up Leo. Owen and Amelia said their goodbyes and handed him over. Unable to deal with it, Owen quickly left for work. Amelia then finished packing while John and Carol fed Leo. She received a call from the hospital, which was flooded with a mass overdose, including Betty and Linus. Amelia rushed to the hospital with John and Carol and learned that Teddy would be operating on Betty's aortic dissection. Amelia took a moment to gather herself and talked with Link, who shared he goes to a blues bar in Barbados in his mind to escape to on stressful days. Their talk was interrupted when they found Linus in a closet, having died after self-medicating with unknown drugs. They were unable to save him and Amelia took it upon herself to call his parents. She broke down and Link comforted her. She then joined Owen, Carol, and John in the waiting room. Teddy eventually came by to tell Betty had made it through surgery. Amelia hugged her. Later, Amelia and Betty's parents visited her in the ICU. While John wanted to keep Linus's passing a secret, Amelia told them about Ryan and how his death was the rock bottom that pushed her to get sober. Together, they prayed that Linus's death would push Betty to decide to live. Betty woke up soon after with her parents and Owen and Amelia by her side.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nThe time came for goodbyes. Betty wasn't sure how to go back to living a normal teenage life, but Amelia told her the drugs were gone now and that she would always be there for her. Without a real goodbye, Betty left with John, Carol, and Leo. As soon as they were gone, Amelia went to get dressed for Catherine's party, unable to spend one more minute in the house.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Amelia run into Tom and Teddy at the party.]]\nShe and Owen ran into a kissing Tom and Teddy at the party. They learned that Tom was taking Teddy on a surprise trip to Palm Springs, which made Owen even grumpier, creating an even bigger contrast with Tom's chivalrous attitude towards Teddy. Amelia then vented to Meredith that she wasn't sure she and Owen were still a thing with the kids gone. While she and Owen intended to talk things out, they started bickering about how he couldn't accept addiction as a disease while he hated how she threw things from months ago in his face. She hated how he never checked up on her while she was in pain, too. She then brought up that he had been staring at Teddy the entire evening and walked away. She consulted with Meredith about Owen's feelings for Teddy. Meredith told her she'd have to make to peace with the fact that Teddy would always be in Owen's life. Amelia then realized she and Owen were in a circle that just kept going around.\n\nOwen later came to tell her that he was staring at Tom, not Teddy. He didn't want Tom around Teddy or his daughter. Amelia told him that it shouldn't matter if he didn't have feelings for Teddy. He told her was being insecure despite his choosing her over and over again, but she couldn't trust that his feelings for Teddy wouldn't flare up once the baby arrived. She couldn't see a way out of that and realized she didn't need to try. She decided to step out of the circle because, unlike Owen, she wasn't stuck in that complicated baby situation. She found she made the right decision when Owen yelled at Tom at the party, which led to Tom punching him in the face. She was evacuated with the other guests when a supposed fire broke out in the kitchen. While outside, Amelia got a text from the Dickinsons and went to Owen's house. She summoned Owen and the Dickinsons told them that they weren't ready to raise a baby, nor did Betty want to be a mother. They realized that Owen and Amelia were Leo's real parents. Betty told Amelia she needed to be a kid who could make mistakes, which she couldn't do with Leo around. This time, Betty did say goodbye to Amelia, after which she left with her parents.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nOwen and Amelia proceeded with Leo's adoption, but the procedure hit a bump when the lawyer discovered that the two of them weren't living together anymore. They hadn't discussed yet how they wanted to share custody, so the lawyer left them alone to get on the same page before she presented the case to a judge. They decided to use the -- approach, which Amelia commented probably wouldn't last after the baby arrived. This brought up Owen's frustrations with Tom and Teddy's relationship. He once again declared that he had chosen Amelia, but she said that breaking up was a moment of clarity for her, and while it hurt, it hurt less than the alternative. Owen then started blaming her, saying that he had tried to blame it on the tumor but that it turned out that she was just fundamentally incapable of love. Amelia then decided to remove herself from the adoption paperwork. She wanted to be in Leo's life as Aunty Amelia as much as Owen would let her, but Leo was and always had been his. She then left the office and went to Meredith's, where her sisters comforted her.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\n\nSoon after the definitive break-up, Amelia attended the Western States Conference for Alternative Pain Relief for the first time, which she found out about after the mass overdose day. Much to her surprise, she ran into Link there, who had attended the conference for a few years. She had avoided Link ever since she broke down in his arms on the overdose day and chose to continue to do so, but she ended up lying next to him at the sound bathing session. Feeling a bit loopy afterward, she and Link sat down in a hallway. She confided in him that she felt unfinished with Betty, which he said is how parents feel. They briefly flirted and almost kissed, but she stopped herself and went to her room, declaring herself unfit for human contact.\n\nShe ran into him in the lobby the next morning. They got coffee together and attended the same talk. She later attended his talk, which chronicled a case of a boy becoming an opioid addict after knee surgery and eventually dying because of the addiction. As soon as Link mentioned he'd prescribe opioids again, Amelia left the room. He later came by her room to explain, but she shut the door in his face. He claimed she would have done the same thing, but she disagreed as she knew how addiction works and how companies are profiting billions off it. He said he would prescribe opioids again, but not blindly this time around, as their effectiveness is unparalleled. He talked about the error of his ways and how he quit medicine after losing the patient, but he eventually returned to make things right. He suggested they take on that fight together. They then started kissing and agreed to be pain relief for one another.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nA glowing Amelia returned to Seattle and Maggie soon figured out that she had had sex with Link. While they planned to keep it a one-time thing, Amelia thought it best if they steered clear of one another as she appeared to be really attracted to his pheromones. That plan failed when they were put on [[Kari Donnelly|Kari Donnelly's]] case together. Kari's spine fractured in two places after a snowmobile accident, which left her paralyzed from the neck down. After delivering the bad news to Kari's child, Amelia and Link ended up making out in the blue light mood room.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref> Amelia and Link's sexual relationship continued for stress relief. Amelia ran into Owen and Leo on the hospital elevator, allowing her to spend time with Leo. Amelia then went to de-stress in the blue light mood room. It surprised her that seeing Owen still stressed her out because of the amazing sex she was having.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nShe and Link flew out to the Catherine Fox Foundation Medical Center in Manhattan to operate on [[Jonah Mays]]. While out of town, they agreed to bend their sex-only rule and had pizza for breakfast together. He talked about his cancer and happy childhood in New York while she said hers there was quite the opposite. In the hospital, they ran into [[Nancy Shepherd]] who insisted they come for dinner. She accepted and begged Link to come, knowing full well it wouldn't be pleasant, but it would prevent months of family gossip and it would give her a chance to prove to her sister that she wasn't a train wreck. She wanted him to pose as Owen so she wouldn't have to tell them her marriage failed, which would pose no problem as her family did not attend the wedding. She promised to make it worth his while if he came with her, so he finally agreed to do that. On the way over, she taught him details about Owen's life that she knew so they could sell it.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia and Link have dinner with her sisters.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Link stands up for Amelia when her sisters berate her for past mistakes.]]\nHowever, they were surprised to find that [[Kathleen Shepherd]] was also attending the dinner. Kathleen quickly cornered \"Owen\" with questions about Iraq, so Link fled to the bathroom and told Amelia they would fake a medical emergency. However, when Kathleen shared that she thought that Amelia just did the drugs for all the drama and that Amelia always runs at the first sight of trouble, Link decided they would stay to prove her wrong. While Amelia briefly left to help Owen out with a stuffed toy emergency for Leo, Link impressed her sisters by de-boning fish in one move. The sisters really liked Link despite their low expectations for black sheep Amelia's husband and the dinner went smoothly until [[Carolyn Shepherd]] arrived right when dessert was served. Carolyn called them out on their lie, having met Owen when she had visited Derek a few years back. Amelia was then forced to come clean and her sisters mocked her and berated her with embarrassing stories from her past, though acknowledging that fake Owen might just be the worst of them all. They also revealed that they had placed a bet on how long her real marriage would last. Amelia blurted out that that kind of behavior is why she kept her tumor from them. Link came to her defense and praised Amelia for the person that she is and the way she parented Betty and Leo. Amelia's family did not know about them, which was the last straw for Amelia, who promptly left.\n\nIn the cab back to the city, Amelia blamed Link for forcing her to stay, stating that he was just pain management and that he now knew too much about her. They went back to the hospital and Amelia pitched a radical, risky surgery when their old plan proved to be impossible. Jonah accepted the plan, but Link feared she was trying to prove her worth after the disastrous family dinner. She firmly said she wouldn't let herself be defined by them and that she was capable of performing the surgery. It went flawlessly. On their way out of the hospital, Link distanced himself from Amelia and told her he'd see her at the plane. Amelia had a brief talk with Jonah's brother, who had no clue what to do with his life now that he wouldn't need to care for him anymore. Amelia advised him to give Jonah time to figure out who he was outside of his brother's shadow. She then reached out to Nancy, who turned her down. Much to Amelia's surprise, Carolyn stopped by the hospital to talk.\n\nThey went to the park and Amelia asked her if she was truly incapable of love. Carolyn shared a story of how Amelia taught herself to ride a bike to join her siblings riding around the neighborhood. She would fall over and over, but she never gave up, nor would she let anyone help her. That made her the most like her father out of all the Shepherd children. The resemblance to her deceased husband was the reason that Carolyn distanced herself from Amelia, finding it to be hard to be around anything that reminded her of him. Derek offered to watch over her and she let him, which she came to regret. She wasn't there when Amelia needed a mother the most, to figure out life and loss and love. Having some experience as a parent, Amelia knew she wasn't an easy child to parent. Carolyn apologized for missing her tumor and the wedding and she was also sorry that things weren't better between her and her sisters. Carolyn said she was to blame if Amelia thought she wasn't capable or worthy of love. She told Amelia to put that thought behind her and move forward, which Amelia wasn't sure she would be able to do.\n\nAfter that talk, Amelia came to the airport and offered Link some doughnuts from a place he had talked about during their pizza breakfast. She told him he was kind and brave with her family and she apologized for how awfully she had treated him. He accepted her apology and they started to cram doughnuts in their mouths while laughing. After arriving back in Seattle, Amelia went to tell her sisters all about her time in New York.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n\nBack in Seattle, Link found a clinical trial that might cure Kari's quadriplegia. Kari was accepted and Amelia, Link, and Tom started to prepare for the procedure. While doing so, Tom picked up on the developing relationship between Amelia and Link and mocked her for dating Ortho Barbie. She acknowledged that fun and easy wasn't her type, but she was liking the change. When he compared that to the way he felt about Teddy, she took pity on him and told him that the baby wasn't the result of a one-night stand but a true love baby. She thought that Owen and Teddy getting together was inevitable. Tom claimed he wasn't scared by that and they went to perform the procedure on Kari.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells Tom to choose an easier option than Teddy.]]\nAfterward, Link invited Amelia for sushi burritos. Privately, Amelia told Tom that he wasn't being brave by fighting for Teddy. He thought she was just hiding behind Link to cover up that she was hung up on Owen. Amelia replied she had come to learn that sometimes, life offers you easy choices and Link was refreshing. While she admitted she may still be hung up on Owen, she was not using Link but instead just choosing an easier path. She suggested he do the same and then joined Link for the burritos.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Link also started to hang out at work. Owen saw how he handled her and found out that there was something going on between them. When she consulted on Owen's case, he asked about Link, but she told him he did not get to ask about that or have an opinion on it. Owen later found her outside Kari's room and told her that therapy made him realize that he was talking about himself when he told her she was incapable of love. It was actually the opposite of true for her. She thanked him for that and gladly accepted his offer to spend more time with Leo.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Link kept sleeping together but she forbade him from sleeping over. When they both fell asleep one day, she made sure the kids were not around before she made him sneak out. She then helped Alex to get the kids ready for the day because Meredith was spending time with a depressed Jo. At work, she and Tom kept checking on Kari as the window of a successful outcome was closing soon. That night, Amelia took Leo home because Owen hadn't returned from his mission to retrieve [[Frances Pinfield]] from the airport. Link then asked her if Owen was her past or her future because he started to feel like there was something real developing between him and her, but her playing house with Owen made him doubt that. She didn't know if they were something real, but she agreed to give him an answer soon. Later, Teddy came by the house and Amelia assured her that she was just there for Leo and that she and Owen were not back together. Teddy came there looking for Owen. She wanted to profess her love for him before their daughter was born, but that time had run out as Amelia pointed out her water just broke.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia called the hospital to have them set things up for the delivery and then arranged for a babysit for Leo. She timed Teddy's contractions and deemed that there was still time to drive Teddy to the hospital herself. However, en route, they got stuck in a traffic jam and found that the freeway was closed because of thick fog covering the city. Amelia found a police officer and convinced him to drive them to the hospital with the sirens on. Teddy appreciated her genius solutions and said they could have been friends in another life. Teddy asked her if she was still in love with Owen. Amelia admitted she still was a little bit, but also said she falls in love quickly and easily.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia tells Link he could be an option if he allows her some time to figure out who she is outside of Owen.]]\nAt the hospital, Amelia was called to Kari's room as she had moved her fingers, meaning the stem cell transplant had worked. Amelia later came to see Owen and Teddy spend time with their newborn daughter. Link joined her and Amelia told him that she jumped into him way too fast on the heels of Owen and the life she thought she was building with him and the kids. She thought of him as a rebound back then, but she couldn't tell if he was more than that to her now. She needed time to look at her options and told him he could be one of them if he didn't need her to decide anything too permanently right now. He agreed to give her time to figure out who she was outside of Owen.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia took Leo to visit his baby sister. Bailey came in soon to fetch her and Owen for an incoming trauma, so Amelia handed Leo over to Teddy and left. While operating on [[Mari Prishna]], Amelia commented she never could have held onto the rope as long as she did. Link made a snide remark, so she clarified that she had just meant to take things slowly with him to put an end to her habit of going all in too fast. A few weeks later, she found Owen looking for Teddy in the ER. He had offended her by offering to milk her. Amelia laughed at him and sided with Teddy. She told Owen that giving birth is a beast to a woman's body, so he would need to be patient with her.\n\nDuring her date with Link, she confessed that she wanted to try a threesome, which he supported. Together, they came up with an explanation for [[Jai Prishna|Jai Prisha's]] apparent stroke: fat embolus syndrome. They rushed over to the hospital and initiated an experimental protocol to prevent Jai from having to live his worst nightmare of being hooked to machines. The protocol worked and Jai recovered without deficits. Afterward, Amelia went to Carina to ask her for a threeway. Carina was confused as she thought Amelia had come to see her about her pregnancy, having noticed the changes in her body. Amelia thought she had just gained some weight because Link eats a lot, but then it dawned on her that she hadn't had her period and that she was, in fact, pregnant.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nWhile accompanying Maggie to retrieve stuff from Jackson's penthouse, Amelia asked her for advice on how to tell Link about the pregnancy. She dreaded telling him but Maggie made her see she had to. Amelia followed Link into a staircase at the hospital and blurted out that she was about eight weeks pregnant. She told him she didn't expect anything from him but didn't want to keep it a secret either. She brought up her bad history with pregnancy but was paged away for a trauma before she could elaborate. After handling the case, they met in the green room and she told about Christopher and how that experience terrified her of ever being pregnant again, which resulted in her being militant on birth control and her consequently hardly menstruating anymore, which explained why it took her so long to notice. She acknowledged she was in a privileged situation and could afford to provide a good life for a baby but she didn't think that was enough to bring a child into the world. She asked about his feelings and he said that while he had imagined worst-case scenarios, hearing her experience made him realize they didn't matter and that the most important thing was for her not to get hurt again. He was willing to suck up his fears and be a dad if she wanted to keep the baby and if not, he would support her in every way that he could. She abruptly left the room. At the end of the day, she told him she had been scared of raising a baby alone but his words had made her less afraid and even a little bit in love, which she attributed to the hormones. She then said they would make an amazing kid and that she would like to meet that kid. He did as well, thus agreeing to become parents.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nWith only Maggie in the know, Amelia informed her first of her decision. She almost let it slip when she ran into Teddy and Leo but managed to dodge and leave. She ran into Link and asked if he had told anyone. He admitted he had told Jo and realized she didn't like that. She thought they weren't in the place of telling people yet. Keeping the secret made Amelia feel like she was lying, which bothered her as she was committed to rigorous honesty. Maggie told her privacy and honesty were not mutually exclusive, which helped her. However, after watching [[Bertram Hollister]] and [[Soyoung Oh]] reunite after six decades, she realized that you can't let go of good things just because they scare you. She found Link and told him that their pregnancy was a good thing and that wanted to share it with her family and friends despite the fact that that scared her. Together, they went to Meredith's house and shared the news with her and Andrew. Contrary to Amelia's expectations, Meredith was over the moon about becoming an auntie and congratulated the pair.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia, together with Maggie, was among the first people to discover the article that was published in Meredith's name trashing Grey Sloan. They informed their sister, who hadn't written anything yet, and found out through them that the website had crafted an article based on her suggestions but without explanations or context. Since it aimed at Grey Sloan specifically instead of the medical system, patients started going elsewhere and two of Amelia's surgeries were crushed. She did assist Jackson in his ploy to provide a pro bono surgery for a -year-old girl without the quid pro quo publicity that Tom wanted to attach to it. She started craving a gravity-blanket or bear hug from Link, which he started to do to calm her down. However, he had had a rough day, so they reversed roles and she lied down on top of him. He then told her he was in love with her. Love had previously scared him as he associated it with divorce and pain but he didn't want to try to avoid pain when life had all sorts of ways to hurt you unexpectedly. She appreciated his feelings and they continued lying there with their hands on her belly.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Link's cancer-versary, his parents visited and wanted to have lunch with him although they hated each other. After  minutes into lunch, it turns into a competition of whose life is better after the divorce. He invited Amelia to join him for lunch, which she hesitated as she is historically bad with parents but Link convinced her to go by reminding her about the time he went to the dinner with her sisters in New York and this year is going to be different as he will be telling them about the baby. During lunch, Link's parents announced that they are getting remarried and his father would like Link to be his best man for the wedding, which brought back the bad memories for Link whereby he was placed in between his parents. Their divorce had put him through hell whereby they used him like a pawn and forced him to chose. He mentioned that he spent Christmas on an airplane in order to see them both and double-majored so they could each have their graduation ceremony. It took him years to manage lunch with parents who wanted to tear each other apart. He doesn't know what to say but he knows he will never treat his kid like that. After dropping the bomb that they are going to be grandparents, he leaves to get some air. Amelia made him realize that he was angry with them, not for the fact that his parents are getting remarried, but because this day was supposed to be about him and not them. Link noted that for someone who says she is bad with parents, she seems to know his parents pretty well, to which Amelia replies that she understands family dysfunction. She told him that they could leave if he wants or he could give them another chance to do better. At the end of the day, Amelia lit up a candle on a plate of candies and takes it to Link to wish him a happy cancer-versary. \n\nBailey was comparing pregnancies with Amelia and was shocked to find out that Amelia has not taken any ultrasound yet for her baby. Amelia knows she should have had one, but she's terrified of what she might find out. Bailey says the best way to fight fear is information. Amelia asks if she's terrible for not getting an ultrasound. Link if surprised she hasn't gotten one yet, which gives her her answer. Link asks if she doesn't want to know everything there is to know. Instead of answering, Amelia points to Andrew and is upset because he dumped her sister, and Link put him on his service. Amelia eventually decided to get the ultrasound by the end of the day. Carina does Amelia's ultrasound and tells her everything is perfectly fine however she's not  weeks. She's  weeks. Amelia says that's not possible because that could mean the baby might not be Link's. Link and Amelia were paged to the ER as the residents were injured at the bar. Link asks Amelia about the ultrasound. She tells him the baby is healthy. When all the patients were treated, Amelia finds Link and says she has to tell him something. It deserves privacy but she has to spit it out. Before she can tell him, Owen and Teddy walk in and loudly announce that they are getting married. They congratulate the couple. Afterward, Link asks Amelia what she wanted to tell him. She tells him it's a boy. Link wants the name Scout in the mix.\n\nLink finds Amelia by the coffee cart and notices she's upset about something. She then sits him down and tells him, with difficulty, that he might not be the father. He knows the other option is Owen. Amelia wanted to tell him first because she wants to be with him and a paternity test won't change that. She tells him to take some time to think. Link and Jo talk about the situation with Amelia. He says it doesn't change anything. He's trying to look on the bright side. Amelia doesn't want a paternity test anyway. Jo's shocked that he's okay with that and calls him on it. She says he can love her and be mad at her at the same time. Both things can be true. At night, Link paged Amelia to the plant room. He told Amelia that there are tests and he should have known from the beginning if there was a question of who the father was. Amelia admits that she's chaotic and doesn't always think things through and sometimes that hurts people. She apologizes for hurting him. He says there are a bunch of people involved in this who deserve to know. Amelia asks what will happen if they find out he's not the father. He says he wants to be the guy who says that it doesn't matter, but he doesn't know yet and they should gather information and take it one step at a time.\n\nAmelia has been avoiding Link since he asked for the test, however, Jo called her out for it to ask her to stop avoid Link as Link has feelings and he's allowed to be upset about what Amelia did. Link enters the plant room, where Amelia is waiting. He asks if the results are back. She says they'll be back tonight and asks him what's going to happen. He says he doesn't know. She asks him if he could try to know what will happen to them if they find out it's Owen's. Amelia asks if he wants to be with her, to be in the baby's life. He says she and Owen have a complicated history and he's worried the future will be shaped by that history. He loves Amelia, but he needs to know. At night, Link is in the plant room. Amelia watches him through the window then walks away. He then gets a text telling him she didn't get the test and that she needs more time.\n\nAmelia discusses with Maggie about her pregnancy and relationship with Link whereby she mentioned that she's further along than she thought, which means the baby might be Owen's. She and Link are really good together. It was perfect and now it's not, because Link is not sure if he wants to be with her if the baby's not his, which makes Amelia unsure if she wants to be with him if the baby is his. She wants Link to love her enough for the baby's biology not to matter. Maggie understands Link. She would be terrified that Owen being the biological father could reignite whatever embers still linger between Owen and Amelia. It wouldn't have anything to do with not loving her enough. Amelia asks Maggie to be on her side for a minute. Maggie imagines the hormones would be overwhelming and she would want to be held and loved no matter what and assured that she's not going to be alone. She then does just that as Amelia breaks down in her arms.\n\nLink is at Meredith's house speaking with Maggie, who says she has heard from Amelia and assures him she's doing okay. He wonders why she doesn't want to talk to him and tell him what the test said. Maggie says Amelia doesn't know the results. Amelia comes down the stairs and says she's not going to pick up the test results. Maggie apologizes for lying. Amelia wants to raise the baby with someone who will love him and her no matter what a blood test says. As it turns out, that's her sisters. She then ended their relationship by telling Link to go home as they are over.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working on [[Brad Spencer]] together, Jo advises him not to blow things with Amelia as Amelia gave him a choice, which is more than Jo got from Alex. Link paces outside Meredith's house. Amelia sees him and opens the door. He tells her he was going to write her a song, but he can't do that as fast as he needed to come there and tell her he doesn't want to live without her. She reminds him of what he said and he says he loves her and wants her. He doesn't care if the baby is his or not. He doesn't want to feel sad or lonely anymore. He's in love and that's what matters to him. Amelia asks him if he really wants to do this, even if the baby isn't his. he says he does. She kisses him and says she needed to hear that because she got the results and he is Link's.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia tells Link they can make it work if he wants to take his dream job. He says there are new things in his life that he loves more than that job. She thinks it's scary that from now on, every want and need and desire is gonna be put on hold for their kid. She makes him promise they will always fight for their dreams.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia started having contractions in the middle of [[Guthrie Hamilton]]'s surgery. Link was paged to her room and Amelia starts to panic about what could happen to their baby. Link doesn't know how to make her feel better so he screams with Amelia on her next contraction. Later, an OB fellow examines Amelia and says her contractions are Braxton-Hicks. They both have a moment of laughter because they thought it was actually happening.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nWhile consulting on [[Richard Webber|Richard Webber's]] case, Amelia's water broke. Link arrived after her initial pelvic exam by Carina. When Amelia was  centimeters dilated, Link was called away by Bailey to perform the explantation and hip replacement surgery on Richard to reverse the effects of cobalt toxicity. Amelia requested Bailey to stay for her labor since she'd sent Link away. After the surgery, Link came into the room and asked Amelia if it was another false alarm. She said she was okay and Bailey called him over to meet his son. He walked over to Bailey and she handed him the baby. He then walked over to the bed and sat on the bed next to Amelia. She said he was beautiful and Link said they both were.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia has spunk and is always very outspoken and charismatic. She is that \"badass\" type of girl who doesn't let anything or anyone get in her way. She also has a knack for saying the wrong things at the wrong time in uncomfortable or awkward situations. She seems to have slight trust issues also, because of her troubled past and has trouble letting others into her life. After overcoming her drug problems, she appears to have matured. Her dark backstory changed her, although she remains straight-shooting, sarcastic, and funny. She sometimes appears to be tough and closed off, but she's occasionally warm and overbearingly compassionate. Callie describes her as \"volatile,\" and she has earned the nickname \"Hurricane Amelia.\"\n\nAccording to her mother, she's the most like her father of all their children in that when she fails, she comes out stronger.\n\n\n\nThroughout her time in Los Angeles, Amelia had several romantic flings, but none very serious except for Ryan.\n\n[[Ryan Kerrigan]]\nAmelia got serious with Ryan, whom she met at a club and subsequently slept with. Amelia and Ryan became very close with their common drug addiction, going on a drug binge for twelve days where they slept together and did drugs. He proposed and she accepted, where she gave him her father's watch, which she had stolen from her mother as an engagement present. After a failed intervention with the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]], Amelia returned to her hotel room with Ryan where they made the pact to \"get clean\" after consuming the last bit of the drugs they had; Amelia passed out and woke to find Ryan dead next to her due to an overdose where he had choked on his own vomit in his sleep. Before his body was taken away, she retrieved the watch from his wrist. After the ordeal, Amelia checked herself into a rehab facility. Once fully recovered, she discovered she was pregnant with Ryan's baby.\n\nShe discovered it quite late because she assumed the symptoms were withdrawal symptoms. When Addison gave Amelia her first ultrasound, she discovered her baby boy was anencephalic, meaning he would be born without a brain. During the pregnancy, Amelia decided to donate her baby's organs to save other babies all over the country. After some difficulties with [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose Hospital's]] lawyers and an ethical disagreement with Sam, the baby's organs were donated.\n\n[[James Peterson]]\nJames and Amelia worked together at St. Ambrose. James kept asking her out, but she rejected him. When they finally went out, he didn't kiss her at the end of the date. He did that twice, which is why Amelia decided to go on a date with someone else. When she was getting ready to go to the date, James showed up at her house and said he couldn't stand the anticipation, and they finally kissed, starting off their relationship. At Naomi and Sam's wedding, he told her they were going to be the ones to get married someday. In March , he proposed to her. She accepted, but the fact that she was facing a new kind of life made her freak out and flee to Seattle, to find out if she could live a life like her brother [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and his wife [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]]. Soon after, she decided to move to Seattle and ended her relationship with James.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMark was Derek's childhood friend and often spent time at the Shepherd household, so Amelia grew up with Mark around. Years later, they had a brief sexual relationship during her first visit to Seattle after the mass shooting. Amelia was shocked when she heard of Mark's death in the aftermath of the [[Flight|plane crash]].\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nAfter some time in Seattle, Amelia began to bond with Owen, as they could relate to each other's rough pasts and offer support to one another and quickly found herself developing feelings for him. Having stayed out of the dating game for so long, she wasn't exactly sure how to approach him, but after some awkward encounters with him, she decided to act on her feelings and went to visit him with a bottle of water, which resulted in a kiss. After helping [[Ruby (I Feel the Earth Move)|Ruby]] save her mom, they hugged. Then they were seen making out in an on-call room and he carried her to a bed. After many interruptions, while trying to consummate their affections, they finally slept together after Owen apologized for lashing out at her while his mother was in the hospital.\n\nAmelia confessed to Derek that she was falling in love with Owen, and was afraid it was going to destroy her. When a surgery went wrong, Amelia accused Owen of only supporting her inferior approach because he had feelings for her. She said she gave up everything from her past life to start fresh in Seattle and that they shouldn't have started dating, as it affected their professional careers. Owen then tried to understand where that was coming from, but after fighting, Owen ended things in an on-call room, calling their relationship a \"plane crash.\"\n\nLater, when Amelia was living with Meredith and Maggie, she was left at the hospital by Meredith and Owen gave her a ride home. When they got there, he attempted to ask her to go to a concert with him and she kissed him.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref> The two continued to grow very close, to the point where Amelia decided to propose to Owen, telling him that despite the fact that marriage may be too soon, she was sure that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> They got married soon after getting engaged in front of their friends and family.\n\nOwen and Amelia's wedding bliss didn't last for long as they realized they had a difference in opinion about starting a family. Amelia felt that Owen was pressuring her to start a family, which she wasn't ready for. Their marital problems got so bad that Amelia didn't come home for weeks and avoided Owen at the hospital. After months of their marriage being on the rocks, Owen had enough and went to ask for a divorce from Amelia. Just as he was about to do so, he discovered that she had a brain tumor, which likely affected her judgment about their hasty marriage. Once the tumor was removed, Owen and Amelia amicably decided to get a divorce, as they didn't know which part of their relationship was not affected by her tumor, which had been growing for approximately ten years.\n\nAfter getting divorced, Owen spent some time away from Amelia and decided to foster a baby named Leo. However, he soon realized he was in over his head and sought help from Amelia, who later moved in to help him and also mentored Leo's birth mother, Betty. Owen and Amelia bonded over their new family. Eventually, Amelia told Owen she still had feelings for him, and they got back together. Their relationship seemed to be back on track until Teddy returned to Seattle and revealed that she was pregnant with Owen's baby. Amelia gave Owen time to consider his options, and he chose Amelia. However, after Betty and Leo went back with Betty's parents, Owen and Amelia started fighting again, leading to another breakup.\n\n[[Atticus Lincoln]]\nWhile looking for the quickest route to the ER, Link met Maggie, who suggested that Amelia might be good for him. He asked Amelia to have dinner with him, but Amelia was confused and quickly declined the offer to go out with him.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Betty was in surgery, Amelia broke down sobbing and Link consoled her.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref> Soon after, Amelia attended a medical conference where she ran into Link, who was giving a lecture. They flirted with each other and Amelia even decided to check out his presentation. After hearing that he prescribed opioids to a patient who became addicted and died and would do the same thing again, Amelia got upset and left. Link continued the lecture, but visited Amelia's room afterward and told her his patient needed opioids, but where he went wrong was not telling him and his mother how addictive opioids could be and not carefully monitoring him to make sure he didn't become addicted. He said he wanted to change the system to a relieved Amelia. Amelia made a move on Link and they ended up hooking up in her hotel room.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> When Nancy Shepherd reunited with Amelia she pretended that Link was Owen.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref> Link and Amelia continued their relationship until Link realized Amelia saw it only as fling when she hid him from her sisters. He called her out for it and told her he wanted something more. After taking some time to think about it, Amelia said she needed to discover herself outside of Owen, but that there might be a place for Link in her future.\n\nAmelia discovered she was pregnant and believed it was Link's until she found out she was further along than she thought. Link asked her to get a paternity test, and she asked if he would still be with her if the baby wasn't his. He said he didn't know, and she texted him later on, saying she never got the test.\n\nShe avoided him for a whole day after she told him she didn't get the test, and he showed up at her door. Amelia told him that she wanted her baby to be raised by someone who loved both the baby and her, regardless of blood. She then broke up with him.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nThey got back together when Link came to her house, not wanting to lose her, and said he didn't care if the baby wasn't his. Amelia kisses him and tells him she took the test. He's the father.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia began feeling contractions in the middle of a surgery and told Taryn to get Tom. Link rushed to her room and they both panicked over what their future would be like with a child. An OB came in and let them know that it was Braxton-Hicks, not labor, which relieved Amelia and Link.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia's water broke in the middle of discussing Richard's case. She walked herself to her room, and Link hurried over later. Carina confirmed that it was labor this time, not Braxton-Hicks. Link was called away into surgery, so Amelia asked Bailey to stay with her. After Link got out of surgery, he came back to see Amelia sitting up and not in pain. He initially panicked, thinking that something was wrong, but Bailey showed him their son. Link sat in bed with Amelia as they marveled at their new child.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the COVID- Pandemic, Link and Amelia struggled with their lifestyle. While Link loved the domestic life and wanted to marry Amelia and raise more kids with her, Amelia felt confined and barely hanging on. Despite their disagreements, Link proposed to Amelia at Maggie and Winston's wedding. She told him no, knowing that she couldn't give him the lifestyle he desired without losing herself in the way. This led to several arguments and even a second proposal, which she also declined, leading to a break-up.\n\nAfter Thanksgiving, which they spent together in Meredith's absence, they slept together. While for Link, this seemed to rekindle things and give him hope on their future, Amelia made it explicitly clear that it didn't change anything for her, referring to the status of their relationship.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Link changed his mind regarding marriage, and concluded that he didn't need marriage to be happy. He only needed Amelia and Scout. He decided to profess his love to her as soon as possible, so planned to go to Minnesota, where Amelia was supposed to be, until he learned she was actually in Seattle, preparing for David Hamilton's surgery. When Link got back to Grey-Sloan, he went to find Amelia and was shocked to see her kissing Dr. Kai Bartley.\n\nBecause of Owen Hunt's injuries, despite Link's anger, Link and Amelia had to operate together. In the middle of the surgery, Kai appeared in the gallery. When Link noticed then, he ordered everyone to clear the gallery. Amelia figured out it was because he saw her kissing Dr. Bartley.\n\nAfter the surgery, Amelia confronted Link over his behavior, and called out his attempts to gaslight her. Later, while talking to Kai at the bar, Amelia mentioned that Link sent her a picture of Scout, since that day he was taking care of their son. She also told Kai she felt bad for how things turned out with Link, saying she hated that he made her break his heart and then made her do it all over again.\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nAmelia had a crush on Carina DeLuca and also masturbated for her study because of this.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia later asked her to be part of a threesome with her and Link. Carina is insistent that the sexual cravings during pregnancy are making her feel this way. Amelia says she isn't pregnant and that she's just been eating a lot, but, she then realizes that Carina is right.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n[[Kai Bartley]]\nKai and Amelia began flirting with each other shortly after their first meeting.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\nFinally, one night, they each attempted to be the last person out of the lab. Kai said they were typically the last one to leave, but agreed to leave first so Amelia could win some points with Hamilton. Before they left, Kai asked about Amelia's family, whom Tom had mentioned. Amelia told Kai about her son and his dad, but then said she was single. Kai said they were also single.<ref>[[Bottle Up and Explode!]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a major breakthrough in their research, they asked Amelia to go get dinner, but Amelia had to catch a flight back to Seattle.<ref>[[Today Was a Fairytale]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Kai and David came to Seattle for David's surgery, Kai and Amelia kissed outside the hospital after Amelia used guided meditation to help Kai calm down.<ref>[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Owen's surgery, Kai met Amelia at Joe's, where Amelia explained that her life was messy.<ref>[[No Time to Die]], x</ref>\n\nOnce Hamilton's surgery was successfully completed, Kai and Amelia worked together to finish their report. They finished and then Kai invited Amelia to their band's performance. After the performance, Amelia went home with Kai and they had sex. The next morning, Kai told Amelia she didn't have to leave, but Amelia insisted that she did because she was a mom who missed her son.<ref>[[The Makings of You]], x</ref>\n\nAt Meredith's party, Kai ended things between them after meeting Scout, because they never wanted children and didn't want to lead Amelia on any longer.<ref>[[Stronger Than Hate]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the breakup, they texted that they missed Amelia. Later, they came to the hospital and told Amelia they couldn't sleep and the two of them kissed.<ref>[[You Are the Blood]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nShe and her only brother Derek share a special bond because they were together when they witnessed their father getting shot. Derek resuscitated her once after she overdosed in her youth, and her addiction issues troubled their relationship ever since.\n\nThey had their last conversation over the phone as she was operating. He was T-boned by a truck and taken to the small, suburban [[Dillard Medical Center]], which was already swamped with patients from the car crash that Derek had helped with. Meredith was called and decided to pull the plug, something Amelia was among the last people to find out about. This upset her since it robbed her of a chance to say goodbye.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith Grey is her brother, Derek Shepherd's, widow. Despite having three other sisters, she is closer to Meredith, her sister-in-law, than any of her sisters. They currently live together at Meredith's house along with her nieces and nephew; and her son, Scout.\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nShe is very close to her former sister-in-law, Addison, and says that she has always been a better sister to her than her three real sisters. Addison did her hair for prom and she was the one to teach Amelia about birth control since Amelia didn't know who to ask. Amelia was the first one to find out about Addison's affair with Mark but decided to keep it secret because of how close she was to Addison. Amelia even offered to be a surrogate for Addison after she had gotten sober but Addison refused, wanting to protect her.\n\nThey were very close throughout the years Amelia spent at the practice and they consistently comforted each other. Amelia lived in Addison's house when she moved in with Sam next door. \n\nAddison grew concerned about Amelia when she suspected her of doing drugs again, and Amelia moved into a hotel. She returned to the practice after being missing for twelve days and Addison slapped her for scaring her but later hugged her as she was relieved she was okay. Addison and the others held an intervention at the practice where Amelia was cruel, insulting Addison where she knew she was sensitive. Addison gave Amelia oxy in order to get her to listen to them, and prevent her having withdrawal symptoms despite the majority of the others holding the intervention disagreeing. Addison threated to call Amelia's family and fire her if she didn't at least try to cooperate with them, stating that, \"I love you Amelia, but I will not love you to death.\" When Ryan was revealed to be wearing Amelia's father's watch, Addison confronted her about it, asking how it would make her mother feel. Addison began to tell the story of how Amelia's father died, provoking Amelia to have an aggressive breakdown and needing to be restrained by Ryan. She threatened to kill Addison if she ever retold that story and left shortly after.<ref name=\":\" />\n\nWhen Ryan died and was taken away by police, she asked if they could call Addison and tell her she was ready to go to rehab. Addison later took her to a rehabilitation centre<ref>[[The Breaking Point]], x (PP)</ref> and helped her through her grief and trauma.\n\nAmelia shut out Addison when Addison informed her that her baby had no brain. She was jealous when Addison officially adopted Henry as Addison had everything she wanted but couldn't have, so she yelled at Addison to stay away from her and told her she hated her. Addison respected this until Amelia went into labour where she couldn't stay away when Amelia was in so much pain (especially since refusing pain-relieving drugs due to her addiction), so she barged into Amelia's room to support her. Amelia accepted Addison's support and let her hold her as she was in labour, declaring she was calling her baby a 'unicorn baby'.<ref name=\":\" />\n\nAddison later admitted she had refused Amelia as a surrogate because she didn't think she was good enough, but that Amelia had proved her wrong and she asked Amelia to be Henry's godmother since she saw how good Amelia was with him. Amelia happily accepted.<ref>[[Mourning Sickness]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nThey pair reunited when Addison came to Seattle to treat a patient and confided in each other about how their lives in lockdown affected them. Amelia told Addison the real reason she broke things up with Link, and Addison told her about her dark times during lockdown.<ref>[[Hotter Than Hell]] x</ref><ref>[[With a Little Help From My Friends]] x</ref>\n\n[[Sheldon Wallace]]\nSheldon helped Amelia give up drugs. After Amelia's rehabilitation, Sheldon had a hard time forgiving her for the mistakes she made when she was using. After a short time, they reconciled. Amelia mentioned to him that he had to live a long life so that she could make everything he did for her up to him.\n\n[[Charlotte King]]\nAmelia and Charlotte were close friends. After Charlotte was raped, they bonded over their similar drug history. They went to AA meetings together and looked out for each other. Charlotte was very protective of Amelia when she knew of her newly developed cravings for alcohol. When Amelia slipped and drank before being paged to operate on a patient, Charlotte took her privilege to operate and fired her. After she hurt her hand in a bar, Sheldon took her to the hospital so that she could fix it. At the same time, Pete suffered a heart attack and Amelia was paged to help Sam in the OR to save Pete's life. Still technically not allowed to operate, Amelia still went and helped. Charlotte checked on her but let her do her thing anyway.\n\nAfter the surgery, Charlotte talked to Amelia again about her addiction. Amelia argued she had never been an alcoholic and her problem was pills. Charlotte disagreed and told her she was still suspended until she got help because she refused to support her addiction any longer.\n\nTo prove that she was able to operate again, Amelia showed Charlotte her one month chip from AA. Charlotte still didn't give her her job back. After talking to Sheldon though, Charlotte gave in and let Amelia take a breathalyzer test to see if she wasn't lying. She was sober. They made a deal that Amelia could operate again, but would have to take a breath test every morning for a while.\n\nAfter Amelia's friend Michelle died, she turned to drugs again. Charlotte eventually noticed her changed behavior and confronted her about her drug use. Amelia quit the practice as a consequence.\n\nWhen Amelia broke into the practice to get her prescription pad, the police wanted to arrest her. Charlotte arrived and identified Amelia to protect her. As Amelia wanted to leave, Charlotte knew she had her prescription pad to get more drugs. She begged Amelia to accept her help but Amelia stormed off.\n\nCharlotte then initiated the intervention in the hopes of saving Amelia. Amelia said some hurtful things during this time but after she got out of rehab  days later, Charlotte welcomed her back nevertheless. Their friendship survived Amelia's relapse.\n\nWhen Amelia found out about her brainless baby, Charlotte tried to talk to her several times but was shut down. When she wanted to donate the baby's organs, Charlotte did everything she could to make that happen despite her own opinion on the donation.\n\nWhen Charlotte was pregnant, Amelia helped her through that time very often. While Charlotte was in labor and therefore in a lot of pain, Amelia walked with her and helped her by soothing the pain with a special grip that Jake had helped her with once.\n\n\nAmelia graduated at the top of her class at [[Harvard Medical School]], completed her [[General Surgery|surgical residency]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]], and followed up with a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship]]. She has published enough research to \"single-handedly wipe out several forests.\"\n\nShe is [[Board Certification|board certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Neurological Surgery|neurosurgery]] and was employed as one of [[Geraldine Ginsberg|Dr. Geraldine Ginsberg's]] [[Teaching Fellow|teaching fellows]] until Ginsberg fired her for discussing with a patient's husband a surgery that Ginsberg did not recommend and considered highly experimental, which was successful.\n\nShe is a world-class neurosurgeon like Derek and although talking to her brother about her situation could help her find a new position she does not want to call him because of the \"lectures and the \"I told you so\"s and the \"You screwed up again\"s that she fears will follow. Amelia takes risks in surgeries and at times appears very confident in her own abilities but when problems arise she can become overwhelmed with self-doubt. Sam had to push her to finish her surgery on Addison's comatose patient after complications arose.\n\nAfter she was fired by Dr. Ginsberg, Amelia worked as a neurosurgeon at the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. After this practice was dissolved, Amelia continued working at [[Seaside Health and Wellness]], the successor of the Oceanside Wellness Group. While working at both practices, Amelia held hospital privileges at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]].\n\nA few years later, she went to Seattle to visit [[Derek Shepherd|her brother]] and [[Meredith Grey|sister-in-law]] as well as their kids. While she was there, she was given privileges at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and eventually started taking over her brother's practice. Since he planned to move to D.C., she took over his job and became the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]].\n\n\n*Amelia is an atheist. \n*She drives a BMW  Series.\n*Amelia is a democrat.\n*She has a freckle that looks like Indiana.\n*She claims to be \"freakishly\" good at stitching.\n*Although she mentioned Derek is the only one who can call her Amy, Meredith has called her Amy on occasion and has her in her phone address book under the name Amy as well. Her sisters have also called her Amy.\n*Amelia was contacted when Derek needed a nerve after the plane crash, but she didn't answer the call and presumably never replied to the message [[Heather Brooks|Heather]] left her.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref> It can be presumed she didn't want to go through uncomfortable and possibly painful medical procedures so shortly after getting sober as it might have amped up her craving for pills. Another reason could be that the plane crash happened at the same time she gave birth to a child that died after birth.\n*[[BokHee]] is her favorite scrub nurse.<ref>[[The Distance]], x</ref>\n*Because Amelia completed a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] prior to a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship]], she is also [[Board Certification|board-certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|general surgery]], but because neurosurgery is considered a sub-specialty of general surgery, Amelia is not \"double-board certified\", as board certification in general surgery is required to obtain board certification in neurosurgery.\n*Amelia was so high at her uncle Adam's funeral she dropped her end of the casket. Her sister [[Kathleen Shepherd|Kathleen]] mistook her for being drunk.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n*She said to Owen that she lost all the men she loved, referring to [[Mr. Shepherd|her father]], [[Derek Shepherd|her brother]], [[Christopher Shepherd|her son]], and [[Ryan Kerrigan|her fianc\ue]].<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n*She doesn't wear panties.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n*Addison took Amelia to get her ears pierced, did her hair for prom and among other things she explained all about birth control when Amelia didn't know who to ask.<ref>[[Who We Are]]]], x</ref> \n*Amelia's mother told her, several years later, that the reason that she had to look out for Amelia is because from all her kids, she is the most like her father and it was hard to be around her because of that. Amelia's mother told her that is her biggest regret.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]]], x</ref>   \n*Amelia knew she wanted to be a surgeon since she was .\n*Amelia has referred to herself, Meredith, and Maggie as \"Lady Chief Trifecta,\" \"The House of Lady Chiefs,\" and \"Sister Lady Chiefs\".<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n*Amelia has a fireworks-themed personalized scrub cap.\n*Classical music puts Amelia to sleep.\n*Amelia is right-handed.<ref>[[God Laughs]], x (PP)</ref>\n*She speaks German.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> She also speaks French on a subconscious level because of the French preschool she attended.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*Her mortality rate is .%, which is better than her brother Derek.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n*She likes to put the thermostat to \"boiling\".<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*She finds her old medical school notes comforting.\n*Amelia needs to floss before sleeping, or else she can't sleep.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n*Amelia had ligyrophobia.

I was just a kid at the time, but the bottom fell out of my whole world. I was.. There was a dark place, and I was in it. Until one day this friend gave me a pill. And I took it, and all of a sudden I felt okay. Better than okay. I felt good, and so I kept taking them and I felt.. great. And when people would try to stop me and tell me it wasn't real, I would just laugh. Because it was real. How I felt, it was better. It was better than being miserable. But it almost killed me. I was dead for three minutes, and let me tell you, when you are lying on a stretcher, gasping for what you think are your last breaths, you don't think that dying happy is better than living sad. Dying sucks. It hurts. In a way that I can't describe to you. And no, I don't believe that people can change. I don't believe that you'll change, but maybe I'm wrong. And hell, maybe you will wake up from the surgery and you will be happy. But if you're dead.. if you're rotting in the ground from some tumor that ate your brain, you don't get a chance to find that out. One more thing, and then I'll go. I'm not a religious person. I don't believe in God. But if I did, I wouldn't believe in a God that wanted you to die the horrible, painful death that you will experience from a giant tumor that will take away your ability to speak, and see, and go to the bathroom, and breathe on your own.

Fight until you can't fight anymore, never let go, never give up, never run, never surrender. Fight the good fight, you fight even when it seems inevitable that you're about to go down swinging. Why do we even try when the barriers are so high and the odds are so low? Why don't we just pack it in and go home? It would be so, so much easier. It's because in the end, there's no glory in easy.

In Chicago, there's this baby girl,  weeks old, with pulmonary hypertension who needs new lungs. Outside Detroit there is a -day-old boy who was born blind, but could see if he had new corneas. I read this blog about this -month-old kid named Gideon in San Diego who's been on a heart-lung machine for months because he needs one tiny valve in his heart. There's burned babies who need skin. There's infants who need livers, and toddlers who need kidneys, and there's even this one -month-old girl named Lulu who needs a multiple-organ transplant. My baby could save all of those babies. He could be responsible for kids leaving the hospital and going home and growing up and falling in love and having sex and arguing with their boyfriends and making mistakes and living and maybe not ruining their lives with drugs. What I'm asking you to do is unimaginable. But it's also everything those other mothers could ever imagine. I'm his mom. And I'm asking you to do this.

They had to get cleared by him before they could operate. He did individual sessions with the doctors as well as group sessions with the residents.\n\nMeredith insisted that she was fine and that he should be worried about Cristina, who was getting married suddenly. However, Andrew believed she wasn't being honest and refused to clear her for surgery.\n\nEveryone else except for Cristina was easily cleared. Cristina skipped some sessions and showed up late to others. Andrew told her the hospital was willing to work with her, to get her whatever she needed. She told him she just wanted to be the kind of girl who got excited over finding the right dress for her wedding. ''(\"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\")''\n\nTired over not being allowed to scrub in, Meredith faked crying and told an emotional tale. However, Andrew still believed she was hiding something, so he just said they'd talk more about it the next day. At a later session, after telling Derek about it, Meredith told Andrew that she'd had a miscarriage. She also told him to clear her or not because she had no control over any of it. He then signed the form to clear her for surgery.\n\nTeddy and Owen spoke to Webber and convinced him to allow Cristina to operate, going behind Andrew's back and insisting that that's what Cristina needed. ''(\"[[Shock to the System]]\")''\n\nWhen his time at Seattle Grace came to a close, he referred the remaining cases to [[Katharine Wyatt]]. He recommended that Cristina be put on light duty in order to continue her recovery. ''(\"[[Superfreak]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Andrew came back to Seattle later, Teddy started seeing him again. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona's]] wedding with Teddy. At the reception, he told her that he'd been offered a permanent position at Landstuhl Medical Center and accepted on the condition that they find a job for Teddy as well. He asked her to go with him. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\n\nHe and Teddy planned to leave, but when day they were meant to fly, a plane crashed into the sound, so they stayed behind to help. He offered his services as a trauma counselor. At the end of the day, he wanted to spend the night in a fancy hotel. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\nAfter accepting a job at Landstuhl Medical Center, he moved to Germany. Teddy was supposed to go with him, but she decided not to and instead stayed with Henry. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nWhile he was at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], he had a brief relationship with [[Teddy Altman]]. They met in the cafeteria, which meant it wasn't a conflict of interest for him as she was never his patient.\n\nWhen [[Arizona Robbins]] asked Teddy what Andrew was like, she realized that she did most of the talking and Andrew listened, which made her worry that she was treating him like a therapist. She went to him with her concerns and he said that listening to her is not work. ''(\"[[Shock to the System]]\")''\n\nWhen he knew she'd be leaving, she started to avoid him because she'd gotten attached to him. However, before he left, he found her and said she chose men who weren't available for whatever reason. He told her she deserved more. ''(\"[[Superfreak]]\")''\n\nWhen he returned to Seattle, they resumed their relationship and he eventually asked her to come with him to Germany when he was offered a position at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\nShe accepted and prepared for the move to Germany. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\nThey were supposed to fly out one day, but stayed when a plane crashed. They offered their services. At the end of the day, Andrew suggested they go get a hotel room and spend the night in the bath, saying that when something like that happens, you want to spend time with your loved ones. Their relationship ended when she chose to remain in Seattle with [[Henry Burton]]. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith initially had a contentious relationship with him as he would not clear Meredith for surgery upon her return to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. Meredith believed that he was negligent in clearing other staff, especially Meredith's husband, [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]]. Despite Meredith's feigned attempts at remorse or distress, he continue to deny Meredith's return to surgery as he believed that Meredith was not being honest with him. It wasn't until Meredith revealed her miscarriage that he cleared her, and Meredith no longer begrudged him.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhen he cleared [[Lexie Grey|Dr. Lexie Grey]] for surgery, Mark vehemently disagreed as he interrupted a session with [[Alex Karev|Dr. Alex Karev]]. Mark yelled at him due the circumstances that led to Lexie's psychiatric-hold and that clearing Lexie was a mistake. Calmly, he responded that Lexie's psychotic-break was due to sleep deprivation and she no longer posed a danger to herself or anyone else around her. Mark accepted this explanation and backed off without further incident.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nRichard held him up in high regard, given his reputation for [[Psychiatry|trauma counseling]]. Despite requests from Meredith, Richard did not override his decision to clear Meredith for surgery and advised Meredith to continue working him until he has assessed that Meredith was fit to return to surgery.\n\n\nDr. Perkins is a renowned [[Attending|attending]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], specializing in trauma counseling, a form of psychotherapy. Dr. Perkins usually offered his services on-site and would remain until his patients were cleared.\n\nDr. Perkins consulted at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] to clear the [[Specialties#Surgical Specialty|surgical staff]] involved in the hospital shooting. Once they were cleared, he referred [[Katharine Wyatt|Dr. Wyatt]] to oversee the cases upon his departure, should any issues arise.\n\nEventually, Dr. Perkins was offered a permanent position at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, located in Germany. After considering the offer, he accepted.\n\n\n*[[Henry Burton|Henry]] referred to him as a professional white knight on a horse.\n*He is left handed.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nAndrewPerkins.png|[[With You I'm Born Again]]\nAndrewPerkins.png|[[Shock to the System]]\nxAndrewPerkins.png|[[Superfreak]]\nxAndrewPerkins.png|[[It's a Long Way Back]]\nAndrewPerkins.png|[[White Wedding]]\nxAndrewPerkins.png|[[I Will Survive]]\nxAndrewPerkins.png|[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.png\nx-.png\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Andrew Perkins Appearances}}\n[[de:Andrew Perkins]]\n[[fr:Andrew Perkins]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Perkins, Andrew}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

It was only when George asked her why she let it get that bad that she revealed that every time someone she loved went into hospital, they did not come out alive.\n\nKnowing that she would die unless the tumor was removed, she consented.

Because of his large size, they were worried they wouldn't be able to handle his case. He had to be brought in by several firefighters. In the ER, they did x-rays and other tests to try to determine the cause of his pain. They also lifted his abdomen and found a severe skin infection over the skin that had been obscured. When they went to take him to get tests, they found that the gurney wouldn't fit through a doorway. They were going to try moving him, but he stood up and tried to walk himself, even though he hadn't walked in a year. He took several steps, but his ankle gave out and he fell to the ground. His ankle was broken. They needed to run a CT, but he was too heavy, so they had to rely on labs.\n\nHis wife told him he'd been laid off five years prior. He'd tried to find work, but after two years, he hadn't found anything and eating made him feel better and that's when he started to gain the weight.\n\nHe had a deep tissue infection, so they needed to operate to remove the infection. It was a very risky surgery, so Derek told them to refer him to a bariatric center. However, Webber convinced him to see Bobby as a patient, not as a potential lawsuit. He agreed to let them operate. When Bobby was told he needed surgery, he tried to decline, knowing he would die, but thinking it might be better if he dies before his kid is born because growing up with him for a dad would be no life for a kid.\n\nAfter talking to Bobby's wife about him, Alex went to Bobby and convinced him to do the work, to let them operate and then change his lifestyle so he could be the father his kid deserves.\n\nThey took him into surgery, where they found a perforated colon. They were able to save him, but he was told he needed to make serious lifestyle changes or he would still not make it.\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Melissa Corso]].\n\n\nHe and his wife are expecting a baby together.\n\n\nHe'd been laid off from his job five years prior.

He was murdered by grieving widower, [[Gary Clark]].\n\n\n\nCharles transferred from Mercy West to the newly formed [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. He instantly started sucking up to [[Izzie Stevens]], even confessing to her that he had a crush on [[Reed Adamson]]. She believed he was genuine, but he later bragged to the other Mercy West residents that he had made her his bitch. He later apologized, stating that they could be friends outside the hospital, but not inside. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nCharles donated blood immediately before going to the ER to treat patients from a hotel fire. When he arrived in the ER, he was told to hold an axe imbedded in a patient steady. However, he fainted and pulled the axe out. On his way down, he was hit in the head with the axe and needed stitches. He was later investigated with the other doctors when [[Cathy Becker|a patient]] died under suspicious circumstances. ''(\"[[I Saw What I Saw]]\")''\n\n\nCharles worked on [[Wallace Anderson]] with [[Arizona Robbins]]. He informed her when Wallace developed another bowel obstruction and scrubbed in on his surgery with her. ''(\"[[Invest in Love]]\")''\n\n\nCharles worked on [[Dr. Singer]], which put him in close contact with [[Izzie Stevens]], who believed he'd gotten her fired. ''(\"[[New History]]\")''\n\n\nCharles participated in a documentary someone was doing about the doctors at the hospital. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Charles saw Reed flirting with Alex and implying that she'd trade sexual favors for the chance to scrub in, he confronted her about it, but she brushed him off. ''(\"[[Blink]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Derek Shepherd]] became Chief after [[Richard Webber]] was ousted, the Mercy West residents were all worried that he'd fire them because he hated the merger. They also gossiped about why Richard was ousted. ''(\"[[State of Love and Trust]]\")''\n\n\nA motorcyclist came into the ER after crashing. On the way into the hospital, the gurney he was on tipped over, sending him to the ground. Charles worked on his case and was able to preserve enough function to make him an organ donor. ''(\"[[Perfect Little Accident]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were forced to attend sensitivity training, led by [[Miranda Bailey]]. She taught \"Reaction, Observation, Communication\" to improve their interactions with patients whose cases needed more sensitivity. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\nThe sensitivity training was required because they were expecting [[Bobby Corso]], a morbidly obese patient. The residents were told not to make jokes. Charles was kicked off the case when he suggested using a CT scan from the zoo because it would be equipped for animals of his weight. However, he was later brought back onto the case because they needed more big guys for the surgery. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:CharlesDying.jpg|thumb|left|Miranda Bailey holding Charles' hand while he passes away.]]When [[Gary Clark]] came into the hospital intending to shoot [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Richard Webber]], and [[Lexie Grey]], he also shot Charles. Charles was working on the case of [[Mary Portman]]. After the lockdown was announced, he came into Mary's room, telling them that the shooter was on the floor. When Bailey saw Clark shoot a security guard and start heading their way, she told Charles to hide and Mary to play dead. Clark came into the room. After seeing that Mary appeared dead, he was leaving when he heard a sound coming from the bathroom. He opened the door and when he saw Charles, he asked if he was a surgeon. When Charles said he was, Clark shot him. After Clark left, Bailey started to treat Charles with Mary's help. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nThey packed his wound but it wasn't holding, so Bailey said they needed to get him to an OR. They put him on a sheet and dragged him out to the elevator, but when they got there, they realized the elevators had been turned off because of the lockdown and then Bailey concluded that Charles would die. She made good on his promise to tell him if that was going to happen and said that he didn't need to be scared because they'd be with him while it happened. When he stopped feeling pain, he knew it was a bad sign. He then asked Bailey to find Reed, not knowing that she was already dead, and tell her that he loved her. He also told her to tell her he was brave. Bailey told him he was very brave. He then told Bailey she was his favorite doctor and died. ''(\"[[Death and All His Friends]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Reed Adamson]]\nHe had a crush on [[Reed Adamson]], but never told her. When they were interviewed for the documentary, she told the interviewer that they've known each other since medical school and he was like a little brother to her. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n[[Paramedic Nicole Cummins| Nicole Cummins]]\nHe thought Nicole was very attractive, particularly focusing on her butt. ''(\"[[Suicide is Painless]]\")''\n\n\nHe claims he once didn't talk to his family for an entire car ride across the country, which took ten days and crossed fifteen states. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nCharles first met Izzie when he apologized to her about Reed taking [[George O'Malley|George's]] cubby. Izzie initially ignored him, but after he talked about his family and himself, Izzie introduced herself. Charlie later asked her if she knew the Research Library code, but Izzie declined, saying she needed every advantage she could get. Izzie then showed him around the hospital and gave him tips. After he saw Izzie talking about her IL-, he confessed that he had crush on Reed. After, she gave him the Research Library code.\n\nTheir friendship later ended when Charles bragged that Izzie was his \"surgical bitch\", since she gave him the Research Library code and did many other deeds. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nHe was one of Charles\us friends when they transferred to Seattle Grace Mercy West together and Jackson mentioned that Charles was one of his best friends not long after the shooting.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\n[[Miranda Bailey]] was his favorite doctor, something he revealed to her on his deathbed.

No God would do this.|'''[[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]]''' describing her feelings over her pregnancy.}}\n\n'''Christopher Shepherd''' was the child of [[Ryan Kerrigan]] and [[Amelia Shepherd]].\n\n\n\nChristopher Shepherd was conceived by [[Amelia Shepherd]] and [[Ryan Kerrigan]] while they were on drugs. Amelia didn't know she was pregnant, as she thought the symptoms were withdrawal symptoms. However, it became clear when she took a pregnancy test. ''(\"[[Andromeda]]\")''\n\nAt first, Amelia refused to have an ultrasound, but she later agreed to let Addison do it. While doing it, Addison revealed to Amelia the baby was a boy, but she suddenly turned the screen away because the baby turned out to be anencephalic (he had no brain). Amelia then fired Addison as her OB and denied herself and her baby prenatal care. However, when [[Jake Reilly|Jake]] brought up that prenatal care was important for both the baby and the mother, she hired him as her doctor.\n\nUpon dealing with a brain dead patient, Amelia decided to donate her baby's organs to save multiple other babies all over the country. ''(\"[[And Then There Was One]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Amelia went into labor, she first told Jake. She was then taken to [[St. Ambrose Hospital]]. A transplant team was composed because of Amelia's wish to donate the baby's organs, but Sam, the only cardiothoracic surgeon in the hospital who was allowed to harvest organs from babies, initially refused to do it. He refused because it was murder in his opinion, as the baby could not be legally declared brain dead because of a functioning brain stem. However, if they'd waited for the baby to die first, the organs wouldn't have been viable anymore, which was why the harvesting had to take place not long after birth. [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] first didn't want to see her baby, but once he was born, she wanted to see her son. She referred to him as the \"most beautiful baby in the world.\"\n\nThe lawyers of the hospital also didn't agree with Amelia's plan. However, seeing Amelia in the hospital room, Charlotte said they would do the surgery. A conversation with Addison and Charlotte's actions also encouraged Sam to take place in the transplant team. His organs were harvested and transported for use. ''(\"[[Gone, Baby, Gone]]\")''\n\n\n*He lived for  minutes.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n*His mother told him he wouldn't be alone after he died because his father was waiting for him.<ref>[[Gone, Baby, Gone]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He was referred to as [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia's]] \"Unicorn Baby\" because when she was , she loved unicorns because they are magical and can do good things because her child would travel the country and do great things and her baby was the magic in other families' lives.\n*His kidneys went to San Diego and Sacramento. Another abdominal organ, presumably his liver, went to Boston. His heart went to Chicago.\n*He was mentioned twice by his mother to [[Owen Hunt]] during the th season of Grey's Anatomy. The first time after [[April Kepner]] and [[Jackson Avery]] lost their son to osteogenesis imperfecta type II, and after [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] death when she said all the men she'd ever loved died.\n*In season  of Grey's Anatomy Amelia said that losing him was one of the reasons she and Owen broke up.

Stephanie and Jackson ran some tests and took scans, revealing that the muscles in esophagus were working against each other instead of working together. The esophagus wall formed a sack, where Dalton's food was being kept, and that caused his bad breath. Jackson explained a minimally invasive surgical procedure to solve the problem. He explained the risks of the procedure, a small one being damage to the vocal cord nerves, meaning he wouldn't be able to speak anymore. After hearing this, Dalton blurted out that his wife had a very cute butt because he didn't want anything to be left unsaid in case he'll end up unable to speak ever again after surgery. Another confession he made was not ever having really liked her brother, after which Karen jokingly asked how soon the surgeons could put him under.\n\n\nOn their way to the OR, Dalton made more confessions to his wife. Her purple dress did make her look fat, and he confessed he lied when he said it was pretty. He wanted his last words to be honest. He then started singing \"It Had to Be You\", which is their song. The wife jokingly asked Jackson to cut the vocal cords when they arrived at the doors Karen wasn't allowed to pass. Dalton then asked her to come closer and whispered something into her ear. Karen then kissed him and he was taken to the OR.\n\nIn the OR, Jackson tried to get to Dalton's esophagus laparoscopically, but when that didn't work he decided to go in surgically through the neck. The nurses prepared for that procedure while Jackson and Stephanie started thinking out loud about what Dalton whispered into his wife's ear, deciding it was most likely that he loved her.\ua[[BokHee]]\uathen informed them the patient was ready, and Jackson started cutting into Dalton's neck.\n\n\nAfter the surgery, Jackson informed Karen that everything went fine, even though they had to go in surgically. Dalton would have a fresh breath again from now on. Stephanie noticed how Dalton was waking up, and his wife greeted him. Suddenly, Dalton had a stroke, and while Jackson examined Dalton's pupils, Stephanie paged Derek Shepherd.\n\nDerek later explained to Karen that Dalton had had a massive stroke that dislodged a blood clot in the carotid artery during surgery. The post-operative stroke is a rare outcome for any surgery, and he assured her they'd persue any avenue to rehabilitation even though he was afraid they wouldn't be able to fix it. Jackson answered Karen's questions, telling her that Dalton is awake even though he can't speak or move. Jackson assured her they'd do anything they can and apologized. Karen asked if he could hear her, which Jackson told her wasn't certain, and she then lovingly started singing their song, just like he did before the surgery.\n\n\n\n[[Karen Marks]]\nDalton has been married to Karen for quite some time.

The labor was going smoothly until the OB determined that the baby had face presentation. He was then born via emergency c-section in the dark during the storm. In the operating room, the doctors had to hold flashlights so that [[Connie Ryan|Connie]], the OB, could see to deliver him. After he was born, his breathing was shallow and his sats were low, so he was taken to the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]] to be monitored and receive oxygen. After he was born, [[Shane Ross|Shane]] noticed that Meredith had suffered from a massive splenic hemorrhage caused by her fall down the stairs. [[Miranda Bailey]] performed surgery to stop the hemorrhage and saved Meredith's life, thus Meredith named her son after her.\ua''(\"[[Perfect Storm]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Meredith was attacked by a patient, [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] and [[Alex Karev|Alex]] brought Zola, Bailey, and Ellis in to see her. However, the three of them were too scared by her appearance and the visit was brief. After she had recovered, the family was happily reunited at home. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n\nFor his fifth birthday, he wanted a superhero party. After Alex had to back out of helping set up the party to operate on a patient and the entertainment cancelled, [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]] offered to help her.

''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]] died, he left presents for Ellis, Bailey, and Zola in his closet. Meredith took those presents to her kids and told them about their grandpa.

Bailey asked Meredith if she would kiss Andrew, to which she said she probably would. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\n\nJust before Meredith decided to turn herself into the police for committing insurance fraud, she sat Bailey, Zola, and Ellis down and told them that she would be gone for a while. Bailey asked where Meredith was going, and she said she had to take care of something very important. She didn't give them details, but assured them that Alex, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], and [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] would be there for them. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was doing community service, Bailey found her vest and asked if he could wear it to school. She told him no, saying she needed it to go to work. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\n\nHe dressed as a football player for Halloween. Meredith was released from jail that day and missed trick or treating with them, but got home in time to help them sort candy. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, Bailey stayed home with his sisters, Amelia, Link, and his new cousin, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] while his Mom treated COVID patients at the hospital and eventually became sick with COVID- herself and had to be admitted. He had an exceptional amount of energy during this time, making Link comment that he needed some kind of outlet for it. When Amelia realized she'd missed Link's birthday, she convinced the kids to watch a movie by saying it was Link's birthday wish, giving them some free time. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nFor his birthday that year his Mom asked him what he wanted and he told her he wanted a big cake all to himself. His Mom bought it for him and at his birthday party he stuck his face right in the cake and then licked the icing off his fingers and made a big production of it. This made everyone who was at the party: his sisters, his Mom, Amelia, Link, and Maggie laugh. Meredith realized that that\us what he really wanted for his birthday was to make them all laugh because at the time the COVID- Pandemic was all over the news and his cousin Scout who was just a baby was keeping all of the adults in the house up all night. As a result, no one in the house was laughing much. His Mom said he looked just like his father Derek the way he lit up. (\"[[Breathe]]\") \n\nShortly after Andrew died, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis had a dance party in the backyard while the grieving adults supervised and tried to figure out how to tell the kids, who had loved Andrew. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nBailey and Ellis stayed home with Maureen while Maggie took Zola to the hospital to see Meredith in the hopes it would help encourage her to wake up. While they were gone, Bailey and Ellis made a fort. When Link and Amelia returned, they asked to be let into the fort. Bailey and Ellis denied them entry without the password. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her pulmonary studies showed a remarkable improvement in her lung capacity and her labs came out clear, Meredith was discharged from the hospital. Instead of leaving to a fanfare, she had Jackson slip her out the back and drop her off at home, where her kids greeted her happily. Because she hadn't told anyone she was coming, the kids' welcome home poster was unfinished, but she appreciated it anyway and asked her kids to tell her everything that had happened while she was gone. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn August , Bailey attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. However, at the wedding, Maggie's father and Winston's grandmother opposed the wedding, wanting to wait until more people could attend, so the wedding was postponed. In April , a new wedding was planned and they all attended. Bailey walked down the aisle with his mother and siblings to spread flower petals at the start of the ceremony. During the reception Bailey, along with both of his siblings, held engagement rings for Link as he proposed to Amelia on the beach after the ceremony. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nAfter working with Addison on a surgery and talking to her about Derek, Meredith invited Addison to her house to meet her kids. They were happy to meet her and asked if she was a friend of their dad's. She said that she was and they immediately got along. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith got stuck in Minnesota when snow caused her flight to be canceled, Amelia was left to cook the meal alone as well as care for all four children by herself. When Link came to drop off Scout and learned this, he decided to stay and help. When he discovered that the oven wasn't on and the turkey was not cooking, he helped her change the meal plan. The kids happily ate the replacement meal when Link said he'd pardoned the turkey. While they ate, Zola asked what an AVM was and Amelia explained. Bailey then asked what sex was, shocking the adults.\n\nAfter dinner, Link and all four kids had a dance party. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\n\nAs Christmas approached, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis helped their mother decorate a Christmas tree at their house. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith traveled to Minnesota to finish up the report on Hamilton's surgery and then spend the weekend with Nick, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis spent the weekend with Maggie and Winston. While fighting with Ellis over a stuffed animal, Bailey ended up cutting his knee. Winston told the kids they were going to play Emergency Room and Zola helped him clean and bandage Bailey's knee. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith returned home from her trip to Minnesota to present Hamilton's case to the staff at the Mayo, Nick came with her. They brought pizza to her house and he met her three children. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith held a dinner party at her house so that everyone could get to know Nick better, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis attended the party. While they waited for dinner to be ready, they played in the backyard with Amelia and Kai and then played hide and seek. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nBailey went trick or treating with his siblings and cousin, Scout, on Halloween. He dressed as Iron Man. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\nWith the move incoming, the whole family started preparing for the move. When a lightning storm hit, Maggie and Winston stayed at the house with the kids packing things while Meredith worked. They told the kids to stay inside, despite Zola noting the low odds of them being struck by lightning. Later, the kids were scared when lightning struck the house, starting a fire. They quickly evacuated and were reunited with Meredith outside as they watched the firefighters of [[SFD Station |Station ] try to put out the fire. Meredith assured them that what was most important was that they were all safe. ''(\"[[Thunderstruck]]\")''\n\n\n*He was named after his father and\ua[[Miranda Bailey]], his parents' colleague who saved Meredith after she delivered him.\n*For his first Halloween, he was dressed as a pumpkin.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n*He is almost always called Bailey.\n*While he was being watched by his Aunt [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], he once spilled an entire bag of flour on the floor.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], x</ref>\n*Before falling unconscious, Meredith said that she knew his name but was put under anesthetic before she could tell anyone.

And it's not always in our hands.|'''[[Derek Shepherd]]'''}}\n\n'''Derek Shepherd''' was a renowned [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]], and board director at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He was married to [[Meredith Grey]] and they have two daughters, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] and [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], and a son, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]]. He died from his injuries after being hit by a truck.\n\n\n\nDerek spent most of his life prior to his arrival in Seattle in New York City. Derek and his sisters attended a French Preschool. As a child, Derek had no hair products, so he had a large afro, acne, a weight of  pounds, and played the saxophone in the school band. He was raised by a single parent, his mother Carolyn, along with his four sisters: Nancy, Kathleen, Liz, and Amelia. Like Derek, all four of his sisters are doctors. His father owned a shop when he was younger, and one day two robbers approached him and demanded that he give up the watch his wife Carolyn had saved tirelessly to buy for him. When he refused, the robbers shot him to death, with Derek and his younger sister Amelia bearing witness to his death while hiding in the back of the store. This event forms a large part of Derek's moral compass and consequently may have inspired him to become a surgeon to help save lives. As a result, he is especially cynical when treating criminals and feels that they do not deserve any compassion from him.\n\nWhile in high school, Derek played hockey. One day, he pushed his friend into the wall and his friend got hurt, but got up and continued to play. It wasn't until the next day that he found out that he developed a brain bleed. He was left in a vegetative state for the rest of his life. Every month, Derek sent money to his friend's mother to help pay for his long-term care.\n\nDerek's childhood best friend was [[Mark Sloan]], who came from a wealthier but emotionally deficient background and was like a second son to the Shepherd family.\n\nDerek used to ride a motorcycle, but after an accident that gave him a scar, he stopped doing so.\n\nDerek went to [[Bowdoin College]] in Maine for his undergraduate years. He then attended [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] with [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] and [[Mark Sloan|Mark]]. During his medical education, Derek was taught by Richard Webber.\n\n\nAfter Addison cheated on him with Mark, Derek left his private practice in New York and accepted Richard Webber's offer to come work for him at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] with the possibility of becoming the Chief once Webber retired. Derek became aware that Burke was in the running too after he was hired. His sudden move to Seattle made him a curiosity to the other doctors as he gave up a well-established and respected practice in New York.\n\n\nWhile Richard was getting treatment for his alcoholism, Derek became Chief of Surgery. The job required more paperwork and less surgery than he thought, and after being in the shooting he was very cautious and didn't want that responsibility, which led to his resignation.\n\n\nGary Clark was a grieving widower whose wife was taken off of life support. He blamed the doctors who had taken her off of life support. He attempted a lawsuit against the hospital but had no case. Still grieving heavily, he went on a shooting spree at Seattle Grace Mercy West. He killed Dr. Charles Percy, Nurse Vivian, Dr. Reed Adamson, and  other people, including  security guards. He also shot Alex Karev, Owen Hunt, and Derek Shepherd, along with four others who were injured, but not killed. The stress of witnessing his shooting caused Meredith to miscarry. Derek coped with the traumatic experience by speeding. He was arrested multiple times for speeding, which led to Meredith leaving him in jail overnight. He quit his job as Chief of Surgery, having intended to do so for some time as he realized he preferred to be in the O.R. instead of doing administrative work. He told the psychologist Dr. Andrew Perkins that the shooting gave him the courage to step down and quit. After getting arrested prior to Cristina and Owen's wedding, Meredith told him about her miscarriage and begged him to stop making her worry about his speeding.\n\n\nInspired by Meredith's mother's disease, Derek decided to try and find a way to cure Alzheimer's. He initially selected Alex to work with him on the trial, but Alex couldn't handle how depressing it was, so Derek asked Meredith to work with him instead. When Richard started to get worried about Adele's mental condition (he knew she had Alzheimer's), he asked Derek to have her put into the trial. She did not get into the trial because her Alzheimer's has not progressed far enough yet, which was shown by testing. Eventually, she did get put into the trial because of her rapidly progressing disease. Meredith switched the envelopes to make sure Adele got the active agent and not the placebo and in doing so she tainted the trial. Meredith would have been punished for her actions, but Richard stepped in and took the blame, knowing that she only did what she did because she wanted to help Adele. The trial data was sent to another doctor to continue the work and Derek was blacklisted by the FDA.\n\n\nDerek came to Seattle with a reputation as a gifted surgeon who had a penchant for taking on \"hopeless\" cases and highly complex procedures that are often passed on by his peers. After being blacklisted by the FDA for the Alzheimer's trial incident, Derek resumed taking on impossible cases. He took Lexie under his wing and they worked on those cases together.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Derek's hand after the plane crash]]\nAfter having to smash his left hand with a rock to free it from plane wreckage, Derek's hand was severely injured. Many bones were broken and there was significant nerve damage. Callie was able to fix his hand, with the help of the donation of a nerve from the leg of Derek's sister [[Liz Shepherd|Liz]]. This was a very long fight for Derek. He thought he would never operate again and resulted in teaching the interns in the skills lab.\n\n\nNot much time after promising Meredith to take a step back to take care of the kids so she could shine, Derek teamed up with Callie to create robotic limbs that could move through mind control. Derek developed special sensors that had to be inserted in the skull in order for the robotic limbs to work. Upon Owen's request, Derek sat down with guys from the President's brain mapping initiative as they expressed interest in using his sensors for their project too. On top of denying them the rights to his sensors, Derek told them they were approaching their project all wrong and set them in the right direction. Later that day, Derek was called by the President, who asked him to join his brain mapping initiative.\n\nDerek accepted the offer and started working with his new colleagues from his office at Grey Sloan Memorial. He kept contact through video calls. He was shown to be of great value to their project when they bent the rules when he stated he'd quit if they wouldn't let Callie continue to use the sensors too. Initially, Meredith resented the fact that he didn't keep his promise to take a step back, as now she had to take a step back to take care of the kids. As he became more and more important, occasional business trips to Washington D.C. were required. Luckily for him and Meredith, his sister Amelia decided to stay in Seattle, thus being able to take over his service, so that he could brain map to his heart's content, and help them take care of the kids, giving Meredith the time she needed for her career. When Derek returned from one of the trips to D.C., he had met the President, who was so interested that he wanted to make the meeting a weekly thing. He offered Derek a permanent position at the NIH and an attending position for Meredith at James Madison Hospital, so Derek could do the actual brain mapping work himself.\n\nMeredith initially wanted to join Derek, but Cristina told her that even though Derek is dreamy, Meredith is the sun, not him. Meredith then decided to stay in Seattle as that's where she grew up and started her family, and she didn't want to be a trailing spouse like her father was to her mother. Derek didn't really understand why, as there'd be nothing she couldn't do in D.C. that she would be able to do in Seattle. However, he decided that Meredith and the kids were more important to him and he turned down the job, even though Meredith didn't ask him to.\n\nThis rendered him bitter and angry all the time, as Meredith wasn't happy with his choice, never showing that she was supportive of his decision. He pressured Meredith to make the most of her career to make up for the sacrifice he made, which she soon grew tired off. During a heated argument, he compared her to her cold mother, resulting in a radio silence between the two. He also constantly butted heads with Amelia, who took over his job as Head of Neurosurgery. He tried to get his old job back but later apologized for that. She understood that he gave up a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but didn't think that was reason enough to take out his anger on the people around him.\n\nMeredith and Derek only managed to speak to each other in \"time-outs\" regarding Maggie, whom they discovered to be Meredith's half-sister. He threw a dinner party, but he and Meredith got too wrapped up in a sexual encounter after months of denying him sex to make it in time. While he started to keep himself under control at home, he still had difficulties at work. When a woman spilled Amelia's secrets about her drug abuse history in the hospital, he simply took her case when the woman requested another doctor for her parents rather than supporting his sister and defending her. In the evening, he admitted to Amelia that he lost himself, not recognizing himself anymore. He wanted to do right by everyone around him, but he only ended up hurting them. He was angry and miserable all the time and didn't know what to do with himself anymore. Amelia said that that feeling is what they call rock bottom.\n\nDerek later butted heads with Meredith over a case. She suspected that he did that because of their latest fights. He acknowledged to Richard that she had every reason to think that, but he assured him that it wasn't the case. They both recognized Ellis in Meredith, this time in the sense of the ambitious surgeon. Throughout the day, a personal assistant of the President's came back to Seattle to offer him the job again, but he refused again. The situation resulted in his biggest fight with Meredith just yet, with him stating he was done compromising himself for her. She replied he did, making her feel his pissiness and resentment all day. He explained that was because she never showed support for his decision, instead trying to prove all the time that he made the wrong decision. His recent behaviors made it clear for her that she had proven it, as he couldn't be happy anymore, diminishing everyone around him. \"I gave up everything!\" he yelled, once again expressing how important the brain mapping initiative was for him. Meredith pointed out that he was the only one keeping him down, as she never asked him to stay, and stated he should've gone do D.C., which he replied was still an option. He took his phone and called the President's assistant, this time accepting the job. He assured Meredith he was really going to leave and walked off to pack his stuff.\n\n\nDerek went to the airport, and right before boarding the plane, he had a phone call with Meredith. They agreed to stop fighting and try to make it work, as neither of them wanted their relationship to end. He went to D.C. and started leading the Brain Mapping Initiative, aided by research fellows. He took an interest in a side project of one of these fellows, [[Renee Collier]], and encouraged her when she felt stuck, eventually even starting to help out with her research. Renee started to develop a romantic interest in him, which ultimately resulted in a kiss between the two. Derek stopped it, saying he loved his wife and didn't want anything else than what he had with her. He quickly left the lab to board a plane to Seattle to go see his wife, forgetting his phone and keys in the lab. At that time, Meredith called him to talk about her day, and Renee picked up the phone, thinking it was Derek calling with another phone. Renee didn't know what to say after answering and hung up, leaving Meredith to think that Derek was cheating on her. Once Meredith and Derek talked, Derek told Meredith he couldn\ut live without her. Meredith said she could live without him but she didn\ut ever want to. The two then hugged and made up. A couple of days after Meredith and Derek were in bed and Derek said that she has always been the one and that Meredith truly did save him. Meredith and Derek then conceived their third child.\n\n\n[[File:Meredithsayinggoodbyetoderek.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith says her last goodbye to Derek.]]\nNot long after his return home, Derek was on his way to the airport for one last trip to D.C. when he witnessed a car crash on a remote road. He immediately leaped into action, saving four people from the wreckage before the emergency officials arrived to take the patients to Dillard Medical Center. Derek returned to his car and began to pull out to turn around when his phone suddenly rang. Leaving the car sideways in the middle of the road, he began reaching for the phone, not noticing an approaching semi, which crashed into the side of his car. Derek was then taken to Dillard where the doctors began examining him. Conscious but unable to speak, he knew that he needed a head CT, and begged in his mind for the doctors to also realize this; one of them, [[Penelope Blake]], quickly did and lobbied to get the CT, but to no avail, as she was repeatedly shut down by her superior, [[Paul Castello]], who believed that Derek's abdominal bleeding was more pressing, even though he was stable enough to get the CT. Derek was rushed to the OR, but by the time the doctors figured out what was going on and managed to bring in a neurosurgeon (whom they had to wait for over an hour after paging him), it was already too late and Derek was pronounced brain dead. Not long after, Meredith, whom the police have brought to the hospital, signed the papers to take him off life-support. She then sat with him as he died, holding his chest and telling him \"You can go\" as he let out his last breath. Interestingly, he continued to narrate in his mind up to almost the very end, even after losing consciousness (and possibly all brain function) -- at one point saying to the attending physicians \"It's too late.\" \"You're too late.\" We are left with the feeling that at some point an ethereal consciousness had taken over where his physical brain was no longer capable.<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nFuneral\nAt Derek\us funeral, it is shown that Cristina is holding Meredith\us hand.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nTired Meredith\nMeredith imagined Derek being with her after completing a long surgery while already being exhausted. She also thought about him as something good to get herself through the surgery.<ref>[[The Room Where It Happens]], x</ref>\n\nDay of the Dead\nDerek was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nInside Meredith's Visions\nWhen Meredith was diagnosed with COVID-, she began to slip in and out of consciousness, often waking up on a beach. Far away on that same beach, Derek stood there, waving and calling her name. Countless times Meredith wanted to come closer to him, walking only to appear back in the same spot. Derek then claimed that the sand \"wasn't real\", and it wouldn't make a difference if he tried walking towards her, much to Meredith's dedication to get to him.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref><ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>Afterwards, they got closer and closer to each other and began to talk about their kids, their family and his death. They had a wedding on the beach and both agreed that Meredith needed to come back because the kids needed her. Derek told her it was not her time yet so she needed to go, although she said there was no pain on the beach. Derek sniffed her hair and hugged her while hearing Zola's voice. Meredith then woke up with Zola by her side and Derek walked away from the beach.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlthough he was sometimes annoyed by his overbearing mother and sisters, he was nonetheless aware of their closeness and had no doubt that all four of his \"very girly\" sisters would be at his bedside if he were ever hurt or sick. He said that he chose surgery as his specialty for the quiet escape and solace of the O.R. His profound hurt over Mark\us affair with Addison back in New York is compounded by his view of Mark as his brother, the one constant male influence in his life since the death of his father as a child. Probably due to his own background and experience of growing up in a large, happy family, he was much more open to meeting Meredith's \"long lost\" half-sisters than she was. He had to encourage her to accept [[Lexie Grey]] and [[Maggie Pierce]] into her life. He took Lexie under his wing and she saw him as the \"big brother\" she never had.\n\nContrary to the lifestyle his salary entitled him to, Derek preferred the simple life and lived in a [[Derek's Trailer|trailer]], much to Addison's horror and everyone else's bemusement, prior to moving in with Meredith. He tried to eat healthy despite his hectic schedule and irregular hours and enjoyed being in nature, especially fishing.\n\nIn contrast to the easy-going Mark, Derek tended to brood. After working on [[Jen Harmon]], who died on his OR table, he spent several weeks hiding out in his trailer. He also tends to hold grudges, as shown when he brought up Addison's affair in a heated argument with Mark and the fact that he still has lingering anger over his father's murder.\n\nDerek tended to have high and exacting standards, sometimes yelling at interns and residents for not meeting them. Although charismatic, his reputation has been known to intimidate the newcomers. However, he was also liked by interns and residents due to his willingness to teach and allow them hands-on experience in his surgeries. He disliked the competitive \"dog eat dog\" attitude displayed by some of the residents and has been known to threaten severe consequences or throw out residents and interns who try to get in on his surgeries through such means.\n\nAt Seattle Grace, he managed to stay friends with Addison, even after their divorce, and was friends with Preston Burke, but was left without friends when they both left [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. He was broken up with Meredith, Bailey didn't want to have a drink with him, and the Chief said he didn't drink. With nobody to talk to, Derek started to talk to Mark again, and they slowly began to rebuild their friendship and soon enough became best friends again. After getting back together with Meredith, he became friends with her housemates and friends, primarily Cristina, Alex, Izzie, and George. They were initially antagonistic towards him as they thought Meredith was sleeping with him to get into the OR, but they quickly accepted him after getting to know him. Derek befriended [[Owen Hunt]] due to his relationship with Cristina, Meredith's \"dark and twisted sister\". After a rocky start to their working relationship, they shared a mutual respect for one another and sometimes hung out with Mark, especially when they have \"girl problems\".\n\nWhen Richard began slipping back into the state of a severe alcoholic, Derek was adamant about Richard seeking treatment for his condition, even if it meant jeopardizing Richard's career in the process. When the hospital board learned that he'd begun drinking again, they presented to him the option of retiring. Derek, on the other hand, stood by the plan that Richard enter a rehab program, sober up, and return to his position as [[Chief of Surgery]]. While still in denial of his predicament, Richard accuses Derek of forcing his problems out into the open so he could get his hands on the position as Chief. While Derek admitted that he did want the job, he still stood by the plan of Richard entering rehab so that Richard could eventually return as Chief. In Richard's absence as chief, Derek assumed the role temporarily.\n\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nDerek married his medical school girlfriend, [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Montgomery]] in , and the two began their residencies, studying under Dr. Richard Webber. Following residencies and fellowships, Derek and Addison quickly became very successful in their respective fields. They appeared to lead an affluent lifestyle, owning both a Manhattan brownstone overlooking Central Park and a home in the Hamptons, as well as running their own private practices. However, their success and busy workloads put a strain on their marriage, and the two grew apart; the emotional distance eventually drove Addison to cheat on Derek with his best friend, [[Mark Sloan]]. Derek himself admitted that he was never around. After discovering Addison in bed with Mark, Derek declared the marriage over and relocated from a private practice to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], accepting a job offer from his former teacher, Dr. Richard Webber, as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Neurosurgery at Seattle Grace Hospital and trading in the brownstone for an Airstream trailer on  acres of rural property on Vashon Island.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[Image:der-mer-sex.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek met his wife, Meredith, waking up after their first encounter.]]\nSoon after arriving in Seattle, Derek met his future wife [[Meredith Grey]] at a bar and went home with her for a one-night stand, only to discover the next day that she was a new surgical intern at the hospital. Although she initially rejected his advances as inappropriate due to their working relationship, Meredith eventually agreed to date Derek, although he failed to tell her about his marriage. His charismatic, charming personality and good looks earned him the nickname \ucMcDreamy\ud among Meredith and her friends. However, their fledgling relationship came to a sudden halt when Addison arrived in Seattle for a consult upon Richard Webber's request.  Addison had also brought divorce papers but made it clear that if Derek was willing to give her a second chance, she wanted to give their marriage another try. Derek struggled over his choice, but ultimately, his sense of obligation to his marriage vows won, and he left Meredith to return to his wife.\n\n[[Image:Candles.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek and Meredith's house of candles.]]\nAfter a -day vacation, Meredith and Derek saw each other for the first time since [[Preston Burke|Burke]] and [[Cristina Yang|Cristina's]] wedding and they both met Meredith's half-sister, Lexie. Later, Derek pulled Meredith aside to ask if their relationship was over, and she said it was. However, they ended up kissing and having \"break-up sex.\" They later said that their relationship consisted of S&M (sex and mockery) only. Derek, thinking about his addiction to having sex with Meredith, told her that he wanted more; he wanted to marry her and have kids with her, to build them a house and have them settle down and grow old together. He wanted to die in her arms when he was  and he wanted them to have a lifetime.&nbsp;Meredith, as she was, said she needed time and walked away, but they continued to have sex. Throughout this, Cristina helped Meredith with her relationship and tried to help her find out what she wanted. \n\nMeredith asked him to live with her, which he agreed to, saying she was flighty like a deer and that they would take baby steps, showing he would show her all the patience she needed. He wanted to force Alex and Izzie to move out, but Meredith didn't, telling him they were her family. However, he said they could stay and that, once again, he would wait until she was ready. When he discovered her mother's diary, he had a conversation with Mark, where his friend asked him about the trailer. He answered that he was more likely to be kicked out by the end of the week, so he keeps the trailer, but she wanted him to stay, so he lends her his trailer so she can read the diary with Cristina, stating that she needs a place where she can be alone.\n\n[[Sydney Heron]]\nAlthough Derek and Sydney were physically close, they weren't yet emotionally close or in an actual relationship. After Derek went on a pity date with [[Sydney Heron]], Meredith was concerned about him dating other women, so she announced to him that she didn't want him to see other women, and even if she wasn't enough for him right now, she was trying and was scared that she would lose him.\n\n[[Rose]]\nShe told him not to say anything yet, so he was unable to tell Meredith that he had just kissed [[Rose]], a nurse who he'd been getting to know and flirting with over the last few days. When Meredith discovered that he had kissed Rose, their relationship ended.\n\nDerek began to date Rose and Meredith entered into therapy with [[Katharine Wyatt|Dr. Wyatt]]. While Derek appeared to be happy in his relationship with Rose, it was clear to those close to him, namely Mark and Addison, that he wasn't. Derek delayed sleeping with Rose and after finally doing so, he admitted to Mark that he had been thinking of Meredith the entire time. Everything finally came to a head when his and Meredith's clinical trial finally saved a life. He tried to find her to celebrate the good news and eventually located her on his land. She had built a house of candles and told him that she was now \"all whole and healed\" and that while she hadn't forgiven him, she wanted them to be \"extraordinary together rather than ordinary apart.\" They kissed before he left to break up with Rose. Rose was angry at him over the break-up, accidentally stabbing him once with a scalpel in the middle of a surgery, which led her to transfer departments.\n\n\nFamily is something that is very important to Derek. His decision to work on his marriage was based largely on his sense of obligation to Addison as his family, the woman with whom he shared \"eleven birthdays, eleven Thanksgivings, and eleven Christmases.\" The choice was not as simple as Derek had anticipated, and he found that he still had very strong feelings for Meredith, even as he tried to repair his marriage to Addison. Shortly before Christmas, he confessed to Addison that Meredith had not just been a fling, but that he'd fallen in love with her; Addison was willing to wait it out, although the situation was complicated further when she and Derek took in Meredith's dog, Doc. Although Derek eventually admitted that the problems in their marriage were partially his fault, his love for Meredith continued to make him emotionally distant from Addison.\n\nWhen Meredith began dating Finn Dandridge, Doc's veterinarian, Derek became so withdrawn and consumed with jealousy that Addison confronted Derek about his ongoing infatuation with Meredith, and even asked Meredith if she was sleeping with Derek. At a hospital-sponsored prom for the chief's dying niece, Derek and Meredith's emotional affair reached the point of no return. After a heated argument in an exam room, Derek and Meredith had sex, but before they could discuss the implications of their actions, Meredith was called away to deal with Izzie, whose fianc\ue had just died. The next day, Addison found Meredith\us panties, which had been left in Derek's tuxedo jacket, and pinned them to the hospital bulletin board, while Derek went to Meredith's house and professed his love to her for the first time. Their reunion, however, was not immediate.\n\nInitially, Derek felt immense guilt over the breakdown of his marriage with Addison and went to the hotel room where she was staying to apologize. Instead, he was appalled to find out that Addison, in a drunken stupor, had called Mark in New York to fly to Seattle for a \"trans-continental booty call.\" To Derek's disdain, Mark decided to take up a position at Seattle Grace in a bid to woo Addison back.  Although he and Addison acknowledged the end of their marriage and began divorce proceedings, Meredith was less certain and decided to date both Derek and Finn before making a decision between the two. While they were dating, Meredith was admitted for an appendectomy, and Finn's concern for her during her illness led Derek to reconsider his pursuit of her. As she recovered from surgery, he told Meredith that he was walking away, freeing her to be with Finn, whom he considered \"the better guy.\" Meredith, however, had already decided that Derek was \"the one\" for her, and broke up with Finn. She kept the break-up from Derek for another week and made the unfortunate timing mistake of telling him just after Addison had confessed that she and Mark had not just been a one-night stand, as she had led Derek to believe, but had actually lived together for two months after Derek left for Seattle.\n\n[[Nancy Shepherd]]\nMeredith's introduction to Derek's family was no less problematic; she stopped by the trailer one night to talk to Derek and discovered a strange woman lying across Derek's bed and Derek, wearing nothing more than a towel and a very startled expression. She would later learn that the woman was Derek\us sister, Nancy, but the explanation of the misunderstanding did not make Meredith any more appealing to Nancy, who continuously referred to Meredith as the \"slutty intern.\" Derek defended Meredith, leading Nancy to acknowledge Derek's feelings for her, but Nancy encouraged her brother to take some time to figure out what he wanted rather than worrying about the women in his life.\n\nFollowing Nancy's advice, Derek asked Meredith for time to take some space for himself and then embarked on a very brief camping trip, which only cemented his desire for Meredith. He found her in the very place they had first met\uJoe's bar\uand they agreed to start their relationship over from the very beginning. While their newly resumed relationship was happy, to begin with, Derek and Meredith began to grow distant after she almost drowned. As the distance between them grew, Derek was tempted to accept a drink from a woman he met at Joe's during Burke's bachelor party, but ultimately refused. The next day, he admitted meeting the woman (who unbeknown to both, was Meredith's half-sister Lexie) to Meredith and confronted her over her level of commitment to their relationship. He told her she was the love of his life but asked that she end the relationship if she was not equally committed. Meredith did not address the issue and instead focused her energies on Cristina's wedding, leaving her relationship with Derek uncertain. After Burke left Cristina at the altar, Meredith made an announcement to the guests that seemed to imply she had given up on her relationship with Derek as well: \"It's over\uso over.\" When Meredith asked her intern to call all four of Derek's sisters to ask for a donor nerve, it is revealed that Nancy still refuses to speak to her and hung up on her.\n\n[[Liz Shepherd]]\nLiz is Derek's younger sister. She donated nerves from her legs for Derek\us hand surgery after the plane crash. Even though Derek initially didn\ut want her to help, he eventually let her.\n\n[[Kathleen Shepherd]]\nKathleen is Derek's older sister. Not much is known about their relationship.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAmelia is Derek's youngest sister. When she was younger, she stole her brother's prescription pad and overdosed. When Derek found her, she was out cold. He performed CPR for a while until an ambulance arrived. She was clinically dead for  whole minutes but was able to be resuscitated. From then on the siblings drifted apart and became estranged.\n\nWhen Derek got shot, Amelia went to Seattle to see him in hopes to restart their relationship. He didn't want her there and made comments on her past with drugs, but before she left for LA again, he talked to her on the hospital parking lot. For the first time, they talked about their father's death and the memories they shared. Derek said that he couldn't call her and tell her he was hurt because ever since their father had died, he had sworn to protect her. He didn't want her to know that pain even exists. They reconnected and their relationship was better ever since.\n\nAmelia visited for a second time when she wanted him to help her with the brain tumor of [[Mason Warner|Mason's]] [[Erica Warner|mother]], that was killing her. It was shortly after she got out of rehab again, so Derek told her she should give up on that impossible task because she was too fragile. Amelia didn't listen and practiced with [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] to perform the surgery fast enough to not kill Erica right on the table. Finally, Derek gave in and agreed to help her because he was sure she would never give up. They later successfully performed the surgery and further bonded over the experience of giving a young boy his mother back.\n\nShortly before Cristina left, Amelia came once again to see her brother in Seattle, announcing she was now engaged to [[James Peterson|James]]. She decided to stay for a while, sometimes scrubbing in with Derek. She was seen having arguments with her fianc\ue and it turned out she wanted to stay permanently. Amelia became head of neurosurgery, taking Derek's job because he wanted to leave for Washington anyway. Before he actually left, they fought a lot in the OR, both not dealing well with the reversed situation of her being his boss. It even came down to him being unclear to Owen about her drug history, so that she almost got fired. He apologized, admitting he wanted his job back.\n\nWhen he eventually returned from DC, he didn't fight his little sister anymore. Derek was okay with taking her orders but Amelia was still suspicious, as she was convinced he wanted his old job back. Their relationship was better than ever despite him only being \"second place.\ud\n\nOne night, they had a conversation about their father again, as they had lost two men who were shot that day. Derek checked on Amelia to make sure she was okay. They sat down and talked about things, her eventually admitting that she was falling in love with Owen. And that she was scared. He reassured her and was totally okay with the idea of her and Owen.\n\nOn the car on his way to DC, before he had the accident, Derek had a call with Amelia. She was doing surgery on a car crash victim with April and Bailey and they talked about him not making it to his flight. The reception got bad and the last thing he said to her was \"Amy, are you there?\" It would be the last thing Amelia would ever hear her brother say as he died shortly after.\n\nShe struggled in the aftermath of Derek's death and would crack morbid jokes about him. Her grudge against [[Penelope Blake|Dr. Penelope Blake]] over her brother's wrongful death drew a wedge between her and her sister-in-law. Meredith wanted to move on and teach Dr. Blake to learn from her mistakes, while Amelia was still vengeful and mistreated her.\n\n[[Carolyn Shepherd]]\nHis mother came to see him and meet Meredith. To begin with, Meredith was nervous and attempted to be the bubbly happy 'Izzie-like' girl that mothers love, including a high ponytail complete with a scrunchie. However, after talking with the true Meredith for only a short while, she told Derek that she was the \"good one\" and gave him the ring his father wanted him to have for the \"one.\ud After accepting the ring, he began to plan a proposal to Meredith but worried that she still might not be ready. But when she mentioned their own future children in passing, he knew that she was ready for marriage. He told Mark he was going to propose, who told Richard Webber, Owen Hunt, and Callie Torres, but kept it secret from Meredith. Everyone suggested a grand proposal so he planned an elaborate one involving roses and a giant teddy bear. However, an emergency call from Addison meant he had to abandon the proposal. After the death of [[Jen Harmon]] (a death he blamed himself for) and learning that he had lost more patients than those he had saved, he became depressed and returned to his trailer after lounging on the couch for several days. He began to drink a large amount and refused to return to work.\n\nRichard informed Meredith about Derek's intention to propose and the ring leading to her going to confront Derek at the trailer. He pushed her away saying that she is \"a lemon\" and that she has just been waiting to get him out of the house. She tells him that she knows about the ring and he shows it to her before batting it into the woods and telling her to go. After being chastised by Richard, Meredith went to see Derek again. Derek asks her whether she would still love him if he wasn't a doctor. Meredith answers no, explaining that Izzie has cancer that has spread to her brain and he is one of only  people in the world who could save her. She couldn't love him if he wouldn't help her. Derek returned to the house and attempted to propose to Meredith but she refused him. He started work again, operating on Izzie. Just before the surgery, Meredith showed up with his ferryboat scrub cap and he asked her to marry him again but she turned him down.\n\nAt the end of her shift, she was waiting for an elevator. After being guided by the chief to the right one, she found a clean-shaven Derek waiting for her. The elevator was decorated with scans of all the surgeries they did together. He recounted the stages of their relationships as they played out during each case. Lastly, he showed her the post-op scans of the different lives they have saved over the years, and, of course, Izzie's brain. \"You got me into the OR,\" he told her. \"If there is a crisis, you don't freeze, you move forward. You push the rest of us to move forward because you've seen worse, you've survived worse, and you know we'll survive too. You say you're all dark and twisty; it's not a flaw, it's a strength. It makes you who you are. I'm not gonna get down on one knee, I'm not gonna ask a question. I love you Meredith Grey, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\" She told him that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him and they kissed. \n\nAs Izzie received treatment for her cancer, Meredith allowed her to plan the wedding for Derek and herself, in which Izzie took great joy in. However, on said wedding day, Izzie began to see Denny again and Bailey and Derek looked into the cause of this hallucination. They discovered another tumor, too small to be seen normally and too small for Derek to operate safely on. With the news of Izzie dying and her previous comments about spending her life with Alex, Derek and Meredith decided to give their wedding to Izzie to give her the happiest day of her life. Meredith and Derek intended to get married at city hall but found they had no time due to Izzie's surgery and the John Doe patient. So they chose to get married by writing their vows on a post-it note. They stated that they'd love each other, even when they hated each other; that they would never walk away and that they would care for each other when they were old, senile and smelly.  The John Doe patient turned out to be their friend George.\n\nEven with their fellow colleagues arguing the two were not actually married, Meredith and Derek viewed themselves as married. They consummated their marriage everywhere, including the kitchen and stairs, and referred to themselves as married. When Meredith chose to donate part of her liver to Thatcher, Derek demanded to be allowed in the OR, stating, \"that's my wife you're cutting into.\" Eventually, they married each other legally, as it facilitated them adopting [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]]. \n\nLater, Meredith gave birth to a baby boy named Derek Bailey Shepherd, to be called \"Bailey\" after Miranda Bailey.\n\n\nProfessionally, Derek is regarded as one of the best [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeons]] in the world. His services result in two million dollars worth of annual revenue for the hospital. He is a \"tumor junkie\" and has performed numerous complicated, risky procedures, including a stand-still operation, two double-barrel brain bypasses, and separation surgery for adult conjoined twins. One of his colleagues and patients [[Isaac (Season )|Isaac]] once commented that the reason he came to Derek to take his spinal tumor out was because Derek, upon seeing his scans, was inspired rather than defeated. His confidence was shaken slightly when his surgery to repair a gunshot injury on a colleague, [[Preston Burke]], resulted in Burke\us hand developing a tremor, but Derek remains a competent and skilled surgeon who has not forgotten the importance of compassion and bedside manner when dealing with patients. He is liked by his patients and their family members as he has a way of putting them at ease.\n\nDerek's professional life hit an obstacle when [[Richard Webber]] announced his plans to retire. Derek had originally been promised the [[Chief of Surgery|chief position]] when Richard offered him the job in Seattle but was surprised to find that the position had instead been offered to Preston Burke. When word got out about Richard's retirement, Addison and Mark joined in the race for chief. Eventually, Webber came to a decision. He offered the Chief position to Derek, but Derek declined it and instead encouraged Richard to stay on as Chief.\n\nDerek's confidence took another blow when he accidentally clipped an aneurysm on a pregnant woman during surgery, remarking that it was unlike him. While [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] is in Seattle tending to [[Archer Montgomery|her brother]], she consults, and Derek suggests a risky procedure, despite knowing nothing of the procedure or its risks, feeling immensely guilty over clipping the aneurysm and will do all in his, or Addison's, power to keep her alive. Unfortunately, she dies later in surgery, upsetting her husband, who calls Derek a murderer in his grief. This sends Derek into a depression. Later, at a deposition, he learns more of his patients have died than survived, which Meredith reasoned was because he often took seriously ill patients who were at their wits' end and had come to him because no other surgeon would operate on them. Nonetheless, he walks out of Seattle Grace.\n\nWhile in his depression, pushing Meredith away and being almost constantly drunk, Bailey sends [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and later [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] to try and bring him back. Derek, however, talks to both of them and makes them feel depressed over those who they have \"killed\", prompting them to start drinking with him, until [[Richard Webber|Richard]] comes and shouts at him, telling him he is in a much better position than he was. He is promoted to Acting Chief of Surgery after Richard is forced into rehab to keep his job. After Derek orders a patient to be taken off life support against her [[Gary Clark|husband's]] wishes, the husband returns to the hospital and searches for Derek, shooting several surgeons on his way to him. The shooter eventually finds Derek and shoots him, forcing Richard to take over as interim Chief during Derek's absence from work. Derek returns and immediately quits as Chief, admitting that he hates the job and just wants to go back to being a neurosurgeon. He later tells the counselor that he had wanted to quit for a long time and the shooting prompted him to finally make the decision.\n\nOver the course of his career, Derek has been the lead surgeon on two clinical trials. The first was initiated by Meredith\upublicized as \"The Shepherd Method\", it is the injection of a live virus into a brain tumor as treatment. The second clinical trial was for the development of a cure for Alzheimer's, which he was able to fund through his earned Phillip's Grant. Derek was then blacklisted by the FDA after it was revealed that the trial was tampered with. The trial was carried on by Carl Baumann in Phoenix.\n\nAfter the plane crash<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>, Derek wasn't able to perform surgery for a while. During this time, he was teaching residents and helping [[Callie Torres]] with her trial on better prosthetics. The work on this trial led him to the development of brain sensors, which caught the attention of the president of the United States. The president requested him for a brain mapping project and gave him the opportunity to run it.\n\n\n*He played saxophone in his high school band. He also played guitar.\n*He had a scar on his forehead from a motorcycle accident.<ref>[[Save Me]], x</ref>\n*He had a thing for [[Ferry Boats|ferry boats]].\n*He drove a Porsche Cayenne\n*When he first moved to Seattle, the floor nurses described him as \"eye candy in a lab coat\"<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n*He was often seen as extremely protective over his sisters, especially [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]].\n*Derek had five kinds of scrub caps, his favorite of which depicts ferry boats.\n*He had a high risk for liver cancer, prostate cancer, baldness, and heroin addiction.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], x</ref>\n*In season one, Derek's lab coat did not show the post-nominal letters of [[Fellow of the American College of Surgeons|F.A.C.S.]]\n*In [[Almost Grown]] and [[These Arms of Mine]], there are scenes that show Derek wearing his \"[[Chief of Surgery]]\" lab coat, despite no longer holding the position at the time.\n*In [[Flight]], Cristina tries to keep everyone conscious, but it's shown that Derek is asleep and dreaming about ferryboats, as his response to Cristina is \"boats\".\n*Before surgery, Derek often said \"''[[It's a Beautiful Night to Save Lives|It's a beautiful day to save lives]]''.\"\n*In [[Save Me]], Derek revealed to Meredith lots of things because he hadn't opened up, ''My mother's maiden name, Maloney. I have four sisters. I have, uh, nine nieces. Five nephews. I like coffee ice cream, single-malt scotch, occasionally a good cigar. I like to fly fish. And I cheat when I do the crossword puzzle on Sunday. And I never dance in public. Um, favorite novel, The Sun Also Rises. Favorite band, The Clash. My favorite color is blue. I don't like light blue, indigo. The scar right here on my forehead, that's why I don't ride motorcycles anymore. And I live in that trailer. All this land is mine. I have no idea what I'm gonna do with it. So that's it. That's all you've earned for now. The rest you're just...just gonna have to take on faith.''\n*Derek claims he never understood Cristina and Dr. Burke's relationship.\n*In [[Here Comes the Flood]], Derek mentions that he is a pain specialist. In subsequent seasons he is shown to be a \"tumor junkie\" who takes on difficult brain or spinal tumors.\n*For Swedish viewers, he is known as Dr. Dr\ufmprins, meaning Dr. Dreamprince. In Brazil he's known as Bonit\ueo, which means \"Handsome\". In Finland he's known as Unelmatohtori, which means \"Dream Doctor\" or \"Doctor of (my) dreams\".\n*He missed his father every second of every minute of every day.\n*His father was never mentioned until [[Wish You Were Here]].\n*Derek's ID badge stated his department was [[Surgery|surgery]] until the merger with [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], and then it was updated to state his department as [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgery]], although there were some scenes that still show his department as surgery.\n*He thought that chewing gum while performing an autopsy is disgusting.\n*In a sense, Derek often rooted for the underdog. He mentored both [[April Kepner]] and [[Heather Brooks]], who at the time he mentored them were not very popular at the hospital.\n*He liked to have  towels in the O.R. in order to support his arms.\n*Derek's last thought was, \"It's too late\".<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref>\n*Derek was one of the \"Grey Sloan Seven\".\n*Derek was one of the \"Seattle Grace Five\".\n*He walked all his sisters except Amelia down the aisle on their wedding days.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n*He made $,, per year.<ref>[[Yesterday]], x</ref>\n*His mortality rate was .%.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n*He went to French preschool.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*His first patient death was when he was a second-year resident and his name was James Hanson.\n*Likened to a Black-Headed Nightingale-Thrush by a patient. \n*His favorite math teacher was Mr. Mulligan.\n*When [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] was , he put Derek's frog in the microwave, but claimed he never pressed start.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Devil]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nDerekShepherd.png\nxDerekShepherd.png\nxDerekShepherd.png\nxDerekShepherd.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Derek-centric or otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Save Me]]\n*[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]]\n*[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\n*[[Let the Angels Commit]]\n*[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\n*[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\n*[[Before and After]]\n*[[Ex-Life]]\n*[[An Honest Mistake]]\n*[[Stand By Me]]\n*[[Give Peace a Chance]]\n*[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\n*[[How Insensitive]]\n*[[Sanctuary]]\n*[[Death and All His Friends]]\n*[[Have You Seen Me Lately?]]\n*[[You Break My Heart]]\n*[[Flight]]\n*[[Remember the Time]]\n*[[Going, Going, Gone]]\n*[[Only Mama Knows]]\n*[[How to Save a Life]]\n*[[The Center Won't Hold]]\n*[[My Happy Ending]]\n*[[It's All Too Much]]\n*[[Good as Hell]]\n\n\n:''' [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] to Derek:''' I have no story.

But the carousel never stops turning. You can't get off.|'''Ellis Grey'''}}\n\n'''Ellis Grey''' was the mother of [[Meredith Grey]] and the ex-wife of [[Thatcher Grey]]. She was also the birth mother of [[Maggie Pierce]]. During her time, she was a world-famous surgeon who was twice honored with the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. She was later diagnosed with [[Medical Glossary#A|Alzheimer's]].\n\n\n\nEllis was born on August , . Her mother was the \"quintessential housewife\", everything had to be perfect from her pleats to her A-line skirt. Her father had numerous affairs with all of his secretaries, which her mother detested but never said a word. Ellis swore never to become someone's doormat as a result. At some point in her life, she met [[Thatcher Grey]]. They married, and welcomed [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] into their lives in early , when Ellis was .  \n\n\nWhen she was pregnant with Meredith, she refused to acknowledge it at any point. When she went into labor, she came to Thatcher in awe, laughing and smiling, finally admitting that they were having a baby. On his deathbed, he said he'd never seen her so happy and carefree before. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nStarting in , when he first came to the hospital, Ellis, along with [[Richard Webber]], treated [[Phillip Nichols]], who ultimately ended up being the first patient in Seattle to be diagnosed with GRID, now known as AIDS. They operated on him even without knowing how AIDS was transmitted. They later stood by his bedside as he died and later toasted his death at [[Emerald City Bar]], where Ellis convinced Richard to toast with alcohol instead of soda. ''(\"[[The Time Warp]]\")''\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ellis had finished med school and started her [[Resident|surgical residency]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], where she was often looked down on because she was one of the few and first female surgeons. Due to her large professional drive and her wanting to prove herself, she worked long hours and didn't spend much time with her family.\n\n[[File:xRichardLeavesEllis.png|thumb|px|Ellis is left alone after Richard chooses Adele.]]\n\nShe bonded with her fellow resident [[Richard Webber|Richard]], who was also being looked down on because of his skin color. They soon started off an affair and began planning a life together. In June , the two of them made a deal to tell their spouses about their affair and leave them, as they didn't want to continue cheating. Right after making the deal, Richard overheard that Ellis was put on the shortlist for the Harper Avery Award for the Grey Method, being the first resident to ever make it onto that list. That night, Ellis told Thatcher, but Richard chose to be with his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]] because he was hopelessly jealous of Ellis's professional success and didn't want to feel like that his entire life. \n\n[[File:xEllisSlitWrists.png|thumb|px|Ellis slit her wrists.]]\n\nDevastated over the fact that Richard left her, Ellis slit her wrists in front of Meredith on June , . Ellis told Meredith not to be scared of the blood and forbade her to call . Eventually, Ellis passed out, and Meredith called . She was transported to the ER and her life was saved, thanks to Meredith. Eventually, Meredith learned that Ellis, being the fantastic surgeon that she was, would have known that the way she slit her wrists would not have killed her, making it clear to her that it was not a suicide attempt, but rather a cry for Richard's attention.\n\n\nWhile being treated, Ellis was discovered to be pregnant with Richard's child, which is why she decided to move to Boston. She stopped drinking wine and wrote down what she ate in her journals, indicating Ellis did want her baby to be healthy. Ellis took her daughter with her and they hid in their apartment. Ellis cried a lot, but Meredith knew not to ask any questions. Eventually, Ellis's water broke and she gave birth to [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] on November , , placing her for adoption. She was sure she wanted to sign away all her rights to the baby, because she needed to start over after Richard left her.\n\nEllis chose [[Bill Pierce|Bill]] and [[Diane Pierce]] to raise Maggie. She described them as kind, loving, hard-working people. They offered to give Ellis occasional updates on Maggie's life, but Ellis declined. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\nAfter Maggie was living with her parents, Ellis and Meredith didn't have to hide anymore, so they moved across town to a nice house. Meredith started first grade and Ellis started her fellowship at [[Massachusetts General Hospital|Mass Gen]], continuing her career.\n\n\nSometime after her daughter turned eight, Ellis won her second Harper Avery Award, which was for the Ellis Grey Procedure. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")'' The procedure was developed with her best friend, [[Marie Cerone]], but Ellis omitted Marie's name from its publishing due to the fact that she was blacklisted from ever winning a Harper Avery Award. This ended the friendship between the two of them. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her diagnosis, Ellis wrote a letter to Maggie as she was forced to face her own mortality. In the letter, she described her decision not to see Maggie as one she was proud of. Her one regret was that Meredith and Maggie didn't meet. She also said she knew that Maggie would be better off with Bill and Diane. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\nBy the time Meredith started her internship, Ellis was living at the [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]]. Her case was advanced, and she most often thought she was still completing her residency. When she talked to Meredith, she sometimes thought she was a friend of hers from college.\n\nAfter her disease progressed to the point where she could no longer handle her own affairs, they had her sign everything over to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]]. ''(\"[[Shake Your Groove Thing]]\")''\n\n\nEllis was brought to the hospital with cramping pain and diarrhea. Because of her Alzheimer's, she was confused and aggressive. She believed that [[George O'Malley|George]] was Thatcher and [[Preston Burke|Burke]] was Richard. Scans confirmed diverticulitis, but also revealed a liver mass. They biopsied the mass, but it was found to be benign. ''(\"[[Make Me Lose Control]]\")''\n\nThey removed the mass and three days later, she was stable and recovering well. She disappeared from her hospital bed and was found around the hospital wearing scrubs and thinking she was still a doctor. They got her to come back to her room, but she disappeared again, this time going to a scrub room to prepare for a surgery she believed she'd be doing. Because of her multiple escapes, she had to be put in restraints. ''(\"[[Deny, Deny, Deny]]\")''\n\nOnce she had recovered, she was discharged back to Roseridge. ''(\"[[Bring the Pain]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out that Ellis had Alzheimer's, Richard began to visit her at Roseridge. He then asked Derek to come check on Ellis and see if she was eligible for an Alzheimer's research trial. She was and Richard convinced Meredith to agree. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\n\nRichard started visiting Ellis after her Alzheimer's was revealed to him. They shared stories of their residency, a time she remembered well. Meredith saw them together and after thinking about it, told Richard he should keep visiting her as it made her happy. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nThe nursing home called Meredith because Ellis had been refusing to eat. Ellis said she didn't have time because she was working. When Richard showed up with food for her, she immediately started eating it. Meredith later had to break the news to Ellis that Richard wouldn't be visiting her anymore because he'd decided to commit himself back to his marriage. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nWhile reliving the first time Richard left her, she had to be reminded that it had happened thirty years prior. ''(\"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\")''\n\n\nOne morning, Ellis woke up in her nursing home completely lucid. She remembered everything except the last five years and the fact that she had Alzheimer's. [[Ms. Henry]] thought it was best that Meredith tell her about the Alzheimer's. Ellis apologized to Meredith for the fight they'd had and tried to figure out why she was in a home. Meredith told her she had Alzheimer's and that she lived in a residential facility. Ellis started to cry and then collapsed and had to be rushed to the hospital. They ran tests to determine the cause of her arrhythmias. Because she was in the Alzheimer's research trial, she asked for a consult with the neurosurgeon who got her into the trial. When she met with Derek, she figured out that Meredith was seeing him. Ellis was diagnosed with a heart condition that could be treated with meds, but Burke decided to do surgery because Meredith said she's often not compliant with medication. She tried to refuse the surgery, but since Meredith was her medical proxy, it wasn't Ellis's decision to make. Meredith said she wouldn't let Ellis refuse the surgery because she said killing her mother wouldn't be another thing that happened to her. During her last lucid moments, she reminisced with Richard about the life they could have had together. Meredith came back and told Ellis that she still hoped they'd find a cure and the two of them would have another chance to get to know each other, but by then, she wasn't lucid anymore. ''(\"[[Wishin' and Hopin']]\")''\n\n\nEllis became agitated and aggressive, so she was given lorazepam to calm her down. Later that day, she coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith's Near-Death Experience\nWhen Meredith drowned in [[Elliott Bay]], she saw her mother in a sort of afterlife, saying she didn't belong there. She said that Meredith was anything but ordinary before telling her to run. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\nAshes\nShe was later cremated, put into a beautiful urn, and for a time was \"hanging out in the back of Meredith's closet.\" ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\nBecause Meredith thought that Ellis' ashes were haunting her, she took them to work and washed them down a surgical sink at the hospital with [[Richard Webber|Richard]], who saw it as a fitting tribute for her final resting place to be so closely associated with the hospital which she dedicated her life to. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\nDay of the Dead\nEllis was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\nMeredith's Dream\nEllis appeared to Meredith in a dream, first giving constructive criticism to Maggie about her article and then telling Zola an idea for Meredith and having her write it down. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\nMeredith's Next Dream\nEllis appeared to Meredith in another dream years later, asking Meredith what she was going to do next after surviving the unbelievable. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nTaunting Meredith\nEllis appeared in another of Meredith's dreams, taunting her about her surgical skills. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\n\nIn the alternate universe, Ellis never developed Alzheimer's, Richard chose her instead of Adele, and they raised Meredith together. Ellis is also Chief of Surgery and Chief of Staff at Seattle Grace. ''(\"[[If/Then]]\")''\n\n\nShe was extremely overbearing, intense, arrogant, driven, determined, and hardworking.\n\n\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\n[[File:xEllisRichardFlashback.jpg|thumb|right|px|Richard leaves Ellis for Adele.]]\nDuring her residency, she had an affair with former [[Seattle Grace Hospital|SGH]] Chief of [[Surgery]], [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]], when they were both residents. As residents, the two doctors had a defining moment in both their careers and their relationship when they took care of one of the first patients diagnosed with G.R.I.D. (Gay-related immune deficiency, an early name for AIDS).\n\nLate in their relationship, Ellis became pregnant by Richard. She gave [[Maggie Pierce|the baby]] up for adoption at birth.\n\nEllis decided to slit her wrists in front of Meredith and forbade her to call an ambulance. When her mother passed out Meredith rang an ambulance and her mother lived. Years later, with the help of her psychiatrist, Meredith realized that her mother wasn't trying to commit suicide, she cut her wrists in the hopes that Richard would find out and take her back. However, Richard never heard about the incident and she was too stubborn to ask.\n\n[[Thatcher Grey]]\nShe was married to [[Thatcher Grey]], who left the family when Meredith was young, partly as a result of Ellis's affair. Ellis and Richard planned to leave their respective partners and get married but eventually, Richard chose Adele over Ellis, although he did still have feelings for her.\n\n\nShe describes her mother as the quintessential housewife. She made sure everything was perfect, but that didn't stop her father from sleeping with all his secretaries. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\n[[Marie Cerone]]\nEllis and Marie were great friends for years until they had a falling out. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nMeredith learned that Ellis and Marie had worked together on what won Ellis's second Harper Avery, the Ellis Grey Procedure, but Ellis had taken all the credit. Many years later, Marie wanted Meredith to publicly make it known that the work was not just Ellis's. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")''\n\n\n[[Elizabeth Fallon]]\nLiz Fallon was Ellis's scrub nurse for  years. When Liz was dying of cancer, Meredith went to see her. During the visit Liz made a comment about Ellis's perfect memory and Meredith couldn't stop laughing, so Liz asked what Ellis was diagnosed with. Shocked, Meredith ended up telling Liz about Ellis's Alzheimer's. Liz revealed that while she'd been Ellis's scrub nurse, she never met Meredith. When Meredith mentioned meeting Liz, Ellis remembered her fondly, that she was a great scrub nurse, asking how she was. ''(\"[[No Man's Land]]\")''\n\nIt is unclear when those  years occurred as Liz Fallon worked at Seattle Grace and Ellis left Seattle after her residency and later worked at Mass Gen, The Mayo Clinic and for the U.N. It has been strongly implied that she never returned to work at Seattle Grace.\n\n\n[[File:Ellissaysgoodbye.jpg|thumb|left|px|Ellis tells Meredith to be extraordinary.]]\nEllis completed her [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She was the only female in her residency class. During her residency, along with [[Richard Webber]], she treated and identified the hospital's first GRID (now known as AIDS) patient. During her final year of residency, Ellis created an audacious laparoscopic technique to treat gallbladders and subsequently named it, audaciously, \"The Grey Method\" when it was published in The American Journal of Medicine. She listed herself as the first author, and it put her on the short list for her first Harper Avery nomination. The nomination itself was groundbreaking as no resident ever had been nominated.\n\nShe later developed the \"Ellis Grey Procedure,\" where she worked very closely with her colleague and then-best friend, [[Marie Cerone]]. According to Marie, she and Ellis developed the procedure together. It was a laparoscopic biliary reconstruction. The procedure was nominated for and later won a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], Ellis' second and final win. Marie, however, did not receive any credit for her contribution because when the time came to publishing the paper, Ellis left Marie's name off of it and listed only herself. Ellis did this due to the fact that Marie was blacklisted from ever being eligible to win a Harper Avery. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")''\n\nYears later, and following Harper Avery's own death, Ellis' daughter, Meredith announced during a public presentation of her own research that the procedure, which she referred to as the \"Grey Method,\" would now be known as the \"Grey-Cerone Method\" to acknowledge Marie's contributions. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")'' \n\nAfter her divorce with Thatcher and break-up with Richard, Ellis moved with Meredith to pursue a [[Fellow|fellowship]] position at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She then won the Harper Avery and dedicated the win to all the female surgeons in the world that would come after her. Ellis continued to be a pioneer in surgery as her distinguished career included tenures at [[Boston General]], the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota and for the U.N., and won another Harper Avery award.\n\nShe has also documented a significant aspect of her surgical training, in the form of videos, which were watched while the group were still interns, and in her [[Ellis Grey's Journals|journals]], writing about her relationship with Richard and her surgical training, referencing staff at Seattle Grace, such as [[Margaret Campbell]], and which Cristina greatly enjoys, for both medicine and romance. According to her journals, the decision of whether or not Ellis would get the first solo surgery was the greatest and most terrifying moment in her life.\n\nEllis wrote at least one book, as Richard supposed she took time off to write another one. ''(\"[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]\")''\n\n\n*She was allergic to penicillin.<ref>[[Make Me Lose Control]], x</ref>\n*Ellis said that carousels gave her the creeps.<ref>[[Bring the Pain]], x</ref>\n*Her patient ID at Seattle Grace Hospital was -.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n*In her Alzheimer's state, she believed that [[George O'Malley|George]] was [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]]<ref>[[Make Me Lose Control]], x</ref>, that [[Preston Burke|Burke]] was [[Richard Webber|Richard]] and that [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] was a close friend from college.\n*[[Richard Webber|Richard]] had mentioned that had she not moved to Boston, Ellis would have been [[Chief of Surgery|chief of surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. In an [[If/Then|alternative universe]] episode, it explores the possibility as she was both [[Chief of Staff|chief of staff]] and chief of surgery at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n*As Meredith (born ), was  in June , when Richard chose to stay with [[Adele Webber|Adele]], Ellis (born August ) would have been  when she gave birth to her daughter.\n*According to Richard in the Season  episode [[I'm Winning]], she won her first [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]] in , when she was a fellow. This is inconsistent with information provided in the following season.\n**Ellis started her fellowship in Mass Gen after placing [[Maggie Pierce]] for adoption in . At the time, Meredith just started first grade. It is possible this was a second fellowship, however. \n**It is heavily implied Richard and Ellis did not speak after he decided to stay with [[Adele Webber|Adele]], though it is possible he reunited with her when she won.\n***It is also possible Richard misremembered, and this was the second Harper Avery Award win, as the Grey Method was established in .\n***In [[Only Mama Knows]] she is shown being told that she has been put on the short list of nominees for the Harper Avery Award, not being called as a nominee in the way Meredith describes in [[I'm Winning]].

She has an older brother, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]], and an older sister, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]].\n\n\n\nEllis was likely conceived the day before her father died, as her parents decided to have another baby on that day and then tried and did have one.\n\nAfter her father's funeral, her mother took her siblings and left Seattle for the duration of her pregnancy, leaving only a note that said, \"The kids and I are safe.\" for friends and family. Despite a placental abruption, which caused Meredith to bleed severely when her water broke, Ellis was delivered successfully in San Diego. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")'' \n\n\nShortly after her birth, her mother and siblings returned to [[Seattle]]. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Meredith was attacked by a patient, Arizona and Alex brought Zola, Bailey, and Ellis in to see her. However, the three of them were too scared by her appearance and the visit was brief. After she had recovered, the family was happily reunited at home. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Thatcher died, he left presents for Ellis, Bailey, and Zola in his closet. Meredith took those present to her kids and told them about their grandpa. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nFor Halloween, she was a ballerina. Her mother got out of jail that day too late to go trick or treating with them, but in time to help them sort candy. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, she stayed home with her brother and sister, [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]], and her new cousin, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] while her Mom treated COVID patients at the hospital.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, Ellis attended her brother's birthday party that year where he stuck his face right in the cake and then licked the icing off his fingers and made a big production of it. This made Ellis, Zola, Meredith, Amelia, Link, and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] laugh, something no one had been doing for a while because of the pandemic and the new baby keeping everyone up all night. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nWhen Amelia realized she'd missed Link's birthday, she convinced the kids to watch a movie by saying it was Link's birthday wish, giving them some free time. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith was hospitalized with COVID-, Ellis was eager to talk to her. They were able to talk over Amelia's phone on video chat. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nShortly after Andrew died, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis had a dance party in the backyard while the grieving adults supervised and tried to figure out how to tell the kids, who had loved Andrew. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nBailey and Ellis stayed home with Maureen while Maggie took Zola to the hospital to see Meredith in the hopes it would help encourage her to wake up. While they were gone, Bailey and Ellis made a fort. When Link and Amelia returned, they asked to be let into the fort. Bailey and Ellis denied them entry without the password. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her pulmonary studies showed a remarkable improvement in her lung capacity and her labs came out clear, Meredith was discharged from the hospital. Instead of leaving to a fanfare, she had Jackson slip her out the back and drop her off at home, where her kids greeted her happily. Because she hadn't told anyone she was coming, the kids' welcome home poster was unfinished, but she appreciated it anyway and asked her kids to tell her everything that had happened while she was gone. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith tried to regain her strength after spending so much time in the hospital, she and Ellis tossed a ball back and forth in the backyard. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn August , Ellis attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. However, at the wedding, Maggie's father and Winston's grandmother opposed the wedding, wanting to wait until more people could attend, so the wedding was postponed. Ellis immediately asked if she could get cake and was delighted when Maggie said she could. In April , a new wedding was planned and they all attended. Ellis walked down the aisle with her mother and siblings to spread flower petals at the start of the ceremony. During the reception Ellis, along with both of her siblings, held engagement rings for Link as he proposed to Amelia on the beach after the ceremony. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")'' \n\n\nWhen Meredith got stuck in Minnesota when snow caused her flight to be canceled, Amelia was left to cook the meal alone as well as care for all four children by herself. When Link came to drop off Scout and learned this, he decided to stay and help. When he discovered that the oven wasn't on and the turkey was not cooking, he helped her change the meal plan. The kids happily ate the replacement meal when Link said he'd pardoned the turkey. While they ate, Zola asked what an AVM was and Amelia explained. Bailey then asked what sex was, shocking the adults.\n\nAfter dinner, Link and all four kids had a dance party. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\n\nAs Christmas approached, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis helped their mother decorate a Christmas tree at their house. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith traveled to Minnesota to finish up the report on Hamilton's surgery and then spend the weekend with Nick, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis spent the weekend with Maggie and Winston. While fighting with Ellis over a stuffed animal, Bailey ended up cutting his knee. Winston told the kids they were going to play Emergency Room and Zola helped him clean and bandage Bailey's knee. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith returned home from her trip to Minnesota to present Hamilton's case to the staff at the Mayo, Nick came with her. They brought pizza to her house and he met her three children. She offered him chocolate pudding surprise, which she had made, telling him the surprise was gummy worms.  ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith held a dinner party at her house so that everyone could get to know Nick better, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis attended the party. While they waited for dinner to be ready, they played in the backyard with Amelia and Kai and then played hide and seek. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nEllis went trick or treating with her siblings and cousin, Scout, on Halloween. She dressed as a chef ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\nWith the move incoming, the whole family started preparing for the move. When a lightning storm hit, Maggie and Winston stayed at the house with the kids packing things while Meredith worked. They told the kids to stay inside, despite Zola noting the low odds of them being struck by lightning. Later, the kids were scared when lightning struck the house, starting a fire.

Afterwards, she settled down in Seattle with her husband and had two children: Owen and Megan. The family lived only five miles from Seattle Grace Hospital. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n\nShe is shown hugging Owen after finding out he was back from Iraq. He did not want to tell his mom he was back until Cristina convinced him to see her. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\n\nShe attended her son's wedding to [[Cristina Yang]]. ''(\"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\")''\n\n\nAfter living as a widow for over thirty years, Evelyn met [[John Finch]] at a writers group. John was fascinated by her stories about her time in the service, as he had himself been in the navy. The two eventually fell in love, but Evelyn chose not to tell her son about John just yet.\n\nOne morning, however, Evelyn had been feeling dizzy and as she was taking a shower, she fell through the glass door. She was admitted to GSMH, John by her side, much to her son's surprise. Owen was concerned that John was only conning her, and seeing her son's harsh reaction, Evelyn broke up with John. However, she then began suffering from severe abdominal pain, startling both Owen and John, who refused to leave without knowing that she would be fine.\n\nEvelyn's pains turned out to stem from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and she was rushed into surgery. Had she not already been in the hospital, the rupture would've been fatal, but since she was, the surgery was successful and she was awake and stable afterwards. She then reunited with John, whom Owen had asked to stay, having seen that John was genuinely in love with his mother. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a fire broke out on Mt. Baker, John was called to the scene, where he was seriously injured. Evelyn came to the hospital to be with him. She sat by his bedside after surgery and was told he'd make a full recovery. She was shocked to see [[Nathan Riggs]] at the hospital, but greeted him warmly. She then told Meredith the history between Owen and Nathan. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\n\nShe attended Owen and Amelia's wedding. At the wedding, she said Amelia looked stunning. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Megan was found in Iraq and brought back to the United States, Evelyn came to see her in the hospital. She wasn't sure about Megan having the more radical surgery, but she was supportive of Megan's decision. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n\nMegan got Evelyn and Teddy together in order to talk to them about Owen and Amelia's marriage. They all agreed that it didn't seem like a stable marriage. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Amelia struggled with what to do with Betty, Owen mentioned that his mother ruled with an iron fist, so Amelia called her to get help. Evelyn assured her that she should drug test her and ground her. She said it sounded like Betty needed a mother, so she should be one. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day Owen and Teddy were supposed to get married, Evelyn came to their house to get the house ready for it. When Owen called and lied that he got called into a last-minute surgery, she helped take down the decorations and informed Teddy, whom Owen didn't call. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the [[COVID- Pandemic]], Evelyn took care of her son's two children while he and Teddy worked at the hospital. During this time, she and Leo made up a game in which she wrapped him in pillows and he pretended he was sleeping on a cloud. ''(\"[[In My Life]]\")''\n\nWhen there was a leftover vaccine from personnel vaccinations at the hospital in January , Owen called up his mother. After he administered the first dose, Evelyn worried she had stolen someone's vaccine but Owen assured her it would have ended up in the trash otherwise. Teddy arrived moments later to witness the event. Evelyn told her she could administer the second dose. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nEvelyn came to her son's wedding to Teddy along with her daughter and grandson. The ceremony started, but before the priest could finish, he was hit by a couple on a tandem bicycle when they lost control during a bike race. Despite the interruption, Teddy and Owen married later that day at [[Emerald City Bar]] with their friends and family present. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Megan learned that a teen in Tacoma had been declared brain dead and his parents had decided to donate his organs, including his heart, which UNOS had directed to Farouk, Evelyn came to the hospital to stay with Megan while Farouk had his surgery. Hours later, they were still waiting in Farouk's hospital room, unaware that Owen, Teddy, and Cormac had been in an accident on their way back from retrieving the heart. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\n\nLate Husband\nHer husband, Owen and Megan's father, died  years prior to her hospitalization. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n[[John Finch]]\nEvelyn met John at a writers group, having began to write stories about her time in military service. John was fascinated about her stories and the two began talking and bonding, eventually starting to meet outside the group as well. According to Evelyn, it took her weeks to realize that he was dating her, and she was astonished that a young man like John was interested in a widow like her. However, she had also fallen for him, and when he kissed her, she felt like they were the same age, all the years between them melting away. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n\n[[Owen Hunt]] is her son. She also has a daughter, [[Megan Hunt|Megan]], who went missing when a helicopter carrying her disappeared in the battlefield. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")'' She was believed to be lost or dead in the Iraqi desert for ten years before the Army informed Owen that Megan had been found. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")'' For those ten years, Megan was held prisoner by rebel forces, but treated well.

He ended up in Iraq as a refugee, where he met [[Megan Hunt]], who raised him as her son for the next six years, though she was never able to adopt him legally. When she was evacuated to the US for medical treatment, he wasn't able to go with her because she couldn't get a visa for him. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n\nAfter seeing Megan's distress at not being able to be with Farouk, Nathan went to Iraq himself and had Farouk fake an illness so he could take Farouk to the US under the guise of participating in a medical trial. When he arrived, they tried to delay his entry while waiting on paperwork, but Meredith convinced them that his condition was critical enough not to wait, so he was taken to the hospital and happily reunited with his mom. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Megan was released from the hospital, she decided to move to the beach with Farouk and Nathan. She sent Nathan and Farouk ahead to set up the [[Megan and Nathan's House|house]]. While they worked, Farouk and Nathan bonded, agreeing that even though they didn't know what they were doing, they were prepared to muddle through together because they both love Megan. Megan later joined them and they went to the beach together and played happily. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n\nMegan and Farouk came to Seattle for Teddy and Owen's wedding. The wedding was initially supposed to take place in a park, but before the priest could finish the ceremony, a couple on a tandem bicycle crashed into him, seriously injuring both him and the couple. After the priest died, Megan stepped in and performed the ceremony at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nFarouk came to the hospital with his mother, who was concerned because he'd been getting short of breath more easily and his ankles were swollen. After an exam and some tests, Cormac diagnosed him with constrictive pericarditis and said he'd probably need surgery to correct it. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Farouk's surgery, Farouk revealed that he'd looked into Winston's surgical reputation and learned good things. He was taken into surgery, which went smoothly. However, when they finished, they discovered his heart had swollen and wouldn't fit in his chest cavity. They injected epinephrine and waited for the swelling to go down. When it did, they were able to close and Farouk was taken to recovery. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nFarouk was still in the hospital on Thanksgiving. He played Monopoly with Megan, Teddy, and Cormac to pass some time. Later in the day, Farouk went into v-fib. Teddy ran the code for thirty minutes before Cormac said there was no saving his heart. He said they needed to put Farouk on ECMO, then they got him put on the transplant list for a new heart. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nWhen a heart became available in Tacoma, Teddy, Owen and Cormac went to retrieve it. While they were gone, Winston took Farouk into the OR so he would be ready when the heart arrived. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhen the heart arrived, Winston examined it and saw that it was bruised from the car accident that occurred on the way to the hospital. He consulted with Maggie, who recommended discarding it and waiting for the next heart. However, Winston decided to go forward with the transplant anyway, believing Farouk didn't have time to wait for another heart. They completed the transplant and the heart began beating strongly in Farouk's chest. They were able to close and move him back to his room. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nAfter his transplant, Farouk was recovering well and his body was tolerating the anti-rejection meds. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\nWhile recovering at Owen and Teddy's house, Farouk began to compete with Owen to recover. Finally, once he'd recovered enough, Farouk and Megan left to go back home. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\n\nWhen his birth parents died, he was informally adopted by [[Megan Hunt]].

He eventually was the perpetrator of a mass murder at the hospital.\n\n\n\nAlison had cancer and went in for surgery. At first, it seemed that the surgery went well, but there were complications. Gary was devastated when his wife had to be taken off life support. He was insistent that she could wake up, despite several doctors' professional opinions stating otherwise. Alison had signed forms three years prior to her death stating that if her survival was dependent on machines, she would like to be unplugged and allowed to die. Gary would not accept this as it was so long ago that she signed the forms. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\")''\n\n\nHe filed a lawsuit against [[Derek Shepherd]] and [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] over the death of his wife. Derek's lawyer stated that Gary had no case, as the hospital had acted in accordance with her advanced directive. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\nMr. Clark, grieving heavily, proceeded to stage a hospital killing spree. He purchased a gun and a large amount of ammunition. On his way to the hospital, he was in a car accident with [[Pete (Season )|Pete]]. When Pete got out to give Clark his insurance information, Clark shot him. He then proceeded to the hospital, where he tried to get someone to direct him to Derek's office. After being dismissed several times, he went into a supply closet, where he asked [[Reed Adamson]] to help him. When she said she was a surgeon and therefore too busy for him, he shot her in the forehead, killing her instantly. When [[Alex Karev]] came to investigate the gunshot, Clark shot him in the lower chest. He then met [[Cristina Yang]] on an elevator and she gave him directions to Derek's office, not knowing why he wanted to know.\n\nGary then went into an open area near a nurses' station where he shot [[Vivian (Sanctuary)|Vivian]] when she told him he couldn't leave the area.\n\nHe continued to move around the hospital, making his way to the floor where [[Mary Portman]] was in a room with Bailey. Charles Percy entered her room, saying the shooter was on the floor. Mary was frightened when Bailey looked through the window and saw Gary coming their way after shooting a security guard. She told Mary to play dead and covered her with the bed sheet. Charles hid himself in the bathroom and Bailey hid herself under Mary's bed.\n\nClark entered the room and started crying because he thought the hospital had killed another patient, like his wife. He pulled open the bed sheet and she nervously played dead and tried not to breathe. He was about to leave the room when he heard a noise in the bathroom. He discovered Charles, who confessed he was a surgeon. Gary then shot him in the abdomen and also pulled Bailey from under the bed. However, she said she was a nurse and Gary apologized and left the room after reloading his gun.\n\nHe then found Derek on the catwalk. Derek initially didn't recognize him, but then told him to find someplace safe. Clark told him that nowhere was safe in that hospital and held his gun up to Derek. Derek talked to him for a moment about how he was human and he was flawed. He finally got Clark to lower his gun when April came out of the office onto the catwalk and startled him. He then lifted the gun again and shot Derek in the chest. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nAfter shooting Derek, he aimed at April, but she talked to him, telling him about her life, showing him that she was a human being, and he told her to run. He then left the area when he saw members of the SWAT team.\n\nHe found [[Lexie Grey]], who was taking blood back to [[Alex Karev]]. He told her what he had intended to do, which was to shoot Derek, Webber, and herself. He went to shoot her, but he before he could, he was shot by a member of the SWAT team and Lexie ran away safely.\n\nFrom there, he went to peds, where he told [[Callie Torres]] he was bleeding. [[Arizona Robbins]] told him that there were only children in that ward. Callie gave him bandages and told him to press them to the wound to stop the bleeding. He took the bandages and left.\n\nFrom there, he went to the OR where Cristina was operating on Derek. He tried to get her to stop, but she refused. Meredith then offered herself up as the eye for an eye, saying that Lexie's her sister, Richard sees her as a daughter, and Derek's her husband. Cristina stopped him by telling him Meredith was pregnant. When he hesitated, Owen tried to charge him, but Clark shot him. Jackson then told Cristina to stop operating and disconnected his leads, making Clark believe Derek was dead. He left and once he was gone, they started operating again.\n\n\nFrom there, he went to the room where his wife died and he sat by himself. He realized that he only had one bullet left. He wanted to shoot Richard and then shoot himself, but he only had enough bullets for one of them, which caused him to want a drink from the flask he'd brought in place of additional ammo. Webber poured out the vodka in his flask and talked to him, saying that killing him wouldn't get him justice. He'd get arrested and taken to prison, but if he shot himself, he'd be free and might get to see his wife again. He shot himself rather than be arrested.

Her mother was busy talking to a friend about a block party. She turned around and her child was missing.\n\n\nHolly was held by her captor in the basement of a house for  years. She was raped many times and abused when she acted like she didn't like it. At some point while she was held captive, she became pregnant. She broke her pelvis as she delivered the baby, who later died. She tried to escape before, but assumed that her parents would no longer want her so she turned around and went back. The reason she left the final time, twelve years after being kidnapped, was because her captor told her she was used up and that he was going to get another girl.\n\n\nHolly was found by hikers in the woods and then brought to the hospital. The original assumption was that she was a lost hiker, but when Meredith saw signs that she had been imprisoned somewhere, she figured out that Holly had been kidnapped and asked Holly for her name.\n\nHer scans revealed multiple injuries, including older ones which hadn't healed properly. While she was in surgery, they connected the name she gave them to a missing person who was kidnapped at age six. A birth mark on one arm positively identified her as Holly Wheeler.\n\nHolly quickly bonded with Meredith after being brought to the hospital. She looked to Meredith for support when the police asked her questions and when her parents came to see her.\n\nHolly's parents brought pictures and a stuffed bunny from their home. Meredith reviewed them with her until she confessed that she remembered all of it, the memories of them and the memories of her captivity. Meredith lied to the parents and said that Holly didn't remember the stuff they brought.\n\nHolly had multiple surgeries after that, to repair the old fractures that never healed properly. She started to talk more in therapy, but refused to talk to her parents. She also hid two granola bars under her bed.\n\nCallie discovered an avulsion fracture which she determined to be quite old. It hadn't healed properly. When she asked Holly about it, she said it probably happened when she had the baby, because she couldn't walk for a while afterward. Her parents were horrified to hear that she'd had a baby who eventually died.\n\nAs part of her recovery, Meredith had to take her to the cafeteria and have her get her own food.

Today, if you become frightened, instead become inspired.|'''Issac''' to '''[[Derek Shepherd]]'''}}\n\n'''Isaac''' was a patient who had an inoperable tumor on his spinal cord. Shepherd went against the orders of the Chief and decided to operate.\n\n\nIsaac came to [[Derek Shepherd]] with a set of scans. He said they were for consult. The scans showed a large spinal tumor. After Derek talked to Isaac about the scans for a few minutes, Isaac confessed that the scans were his and he was the one who had the tumor. Despite Derek believing the only way to remove it was by cutting the spinal cord and paralyzing him, Isaac asked Derek to try to remove it. Other doctors had dismissed the pain as other things, so he ran an MRI on himself, which showed the tumor. He'd done a lot of research on neurosurgeons and knew that Derek took the most risks.\n\nDerek got fresh scans and thought about it. [[Richard Webber]] told Derek he couldn't operate. However, Derek went behind his back and auditioned the residents to find someone naturally gifted in microsurgery. [[Jackson Avery]] won a spot on the OR team. Before his surgery, Isaac told Derek to cut the cord if he needed to, because he could survive the loss of his legs.\n\nDerek took him into surgery, where he opened and spent several hours just looking at the tumor. He spent over  hours looking at the spine without making a single cut before finally closing when Richard came in and demanded it.\n\nHe told Isaac that there wasn't any way to remove the tumor without risking his life and he wouldn't cut the cord while Isaac still had use of his legs. Isaac insisted that they would try again the next day. Derek said he couldn't try again, but Isaac told him to go home and sleep on it. Derek went home and drew a picture of the tumor on his bedroom wall and talked through it with Meredith.\n\nThe next day, he told Richard he would be cutting the cord to remove the tumor, but he instead started to remove the tumor just by picking a place and starting to cut. He got to a place where he didn't know which vessel fed the cord and which fed the tumor. He decided to come back to it at the end. He got to the end and had to make a cut.\n\nIsaac woke up after surgery and was upset because he could move his toes, thinking it meant that Derek hadn't removed the tumor. Derek informed him that he'd removed the whole tumor and Isaac was going to be okay.\n\n\n\nHe was married. His wife starved to death while in a refugee camp.\n\n\nHis parents, brothers, and sisters are dead.\n\nHis child starved to death while in a refugee camp.\n\n\nIsaac is very popular among the doctors at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n\nIsaac is a radiology tech at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n\n*English is not his first language.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Isaac}}\n\n[[de:Isaac]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Support Staff]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She looked into it and found out that Meredith had also been fired from the hospital. Panicked, Meredith took Zola and hid.

Janet informed [[Alex Karev|Alex]] that he couldn't tell Meredith and Derek that Zola was in the hospital because it was a conflict of interest.

''(\"[[Put Me In, Coach]]\")''\n\nHowever, Janet later called to inform Meredith that their hearing date had been cancelled. She said it either meant that they loved Meredith and Derek and they were giving Zola to them or they weren't going to get Zola back. And Janet hadn't gotten a call saying that they were getting Zola back. She advised Meredith and Derek to think about moving on. ''(\"[[Dark Was the Night]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting for the pizza she ordered, Meredith and Derek agreed that they'd be happy with just the two of them. When the doorbell rang, Meredith thought the pizza was there and left the kitchen to pay the dellivery guy. Instead of the pizza delivery guy, she saw Janet and Zola standing in front of the door. \"Derek, is that our baby?\" she smilingly asked him. Derek quickly came over too and opened the front door.

She blamed her pregnancy for leaving the car in drive. His shoulder was dislocated and he had burns from the road. His injuries were treated in surgery. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital with Rob, Jen collapsed. She had a normal neuro exam, but her blood pressure was elevated, so they struggled to get it back down before it started affecting the baby. Her husband told the doctors that eating calms her down and she likes cheeseburgers, so they got her one to try to keep her blood pressure down. Jen started panicking again when Lexie said that Rob's surgery was taking longer than expected, but after Lexie's calmed her, it went way down and Jen had a seizure. An MRI then revealed an aneurysm, for which they scheduled surgery. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\nHer surgery was scheduled for the next morning, but it was pushed back so he could treat [[Archer Montgomery]]. Jen became increasingly nervous as she waited for her surgery. [[Alex Karev]] tried to calm her down by showing her her son's face and having her focus on that. At the end of the day, Derek told her her surgery was scheduled for the first thing the next morning. She begged him not to make her wait another night, so he took her into surgery that night. In surgery, there was unexpected bleeding, but they were able to stop it and Derek clipped the aneurysm. Shortly after her surgery, Jen became unstable again and Derek was called back to the hospital. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\nWhen he arrived back at the hospital, he found Jen with difficulty breathing. He then consulted with Addison on the case. Addison suggested that the baby could be the problem. They did a doppler and found that the baby was anemic and Jen was mirroring. After running more tests, which showed that the baby was in heart failure, Addison said it was likely due to the blood Jen had gotten during her first surgery being incompatible with the baby. Addison said ideally, she'd do an in utero blood transfusion, but this wasn't ideal. She instead suggested delivering the baby to save Jen's life. Jen declined and said she wanted to wait two weeks to give him a better chance. They asked for another option, so Derek mentioned the transfusion, despite Addison saying it was too risky. Jen insisted that she wanted it. Addison did the transfusion successfully. ''(\"[[Ex-Life]]\")''\n\n\nJen was stable after her surgery, but unable to speak clearly due to blood flow issues, Derek stayed by her bedside for several hours, guilty for having nicked the aneurysm in her first surgery. Derek took her into surgery for a EC-IC Bypass to stop the mini-strokes she was having. Addison came into the surgery to monitor the baby throughout. In surgery, Jen and the baby became unstable. Addison wanted to deliver the baby, but Derek asked her to wait. He stabilized Jen just before she made the incision to deliver. After her surgery, the aphasia had cleared, but she had developed pre-eclampsia. Later, her patch blew and she had to be taken back into surgery. Derek made the radical decision to remove her temporal lobe. When the bleeding spread into her frontal lobe, he decided to remove that as well. Addison objected and eventually had to call in [[Richard Webber|The Chief]] to get Derek to back down and allow Addison to deliver the baby. Addison did the c-section and Jen was pronounced dead shortly after. ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\n\nDerek was later deposed for a lawsuit because of Jen's death.

However, his wife insisted that he have the surgery or she would leave him.\n\nIn surgery, they removed several warts. From one of them, a spider crawled out. Mark came in to do skin grafts, but warts had already started growing on the healthy skin, meaning his grafts would have to wait. His wife was told it would be six months to a year.

Meredith asked for therapy tools she could use to move on so she could concentrate on their clinical trial patients. They hadn't yet managed to save one and she wanted to save one, so she needed to concentrate. Wyatt told her the only way to get rid of the fantasies was to remember the reality, that he won't be kissing Meredith because he's with Rose. At the end of the day, she told Wyatt she thought she was successful and it was a good day, but Wyatt told her it was a load of crap.

Meredith asked if she was calling her a coward and then left the room. ''(\"[[The Becoming]]\")''\n\nMeredith came back to Wyatt's office, but only to tell her she was quitting therapy. Meredith insisted that she wasn't quitting, but firing Wyatt. Wyatt said that her mother quit her father and she quit her life momentarily a few times. Quitting is what she knows how to do. Meredith stormed out. Meredith later returned to get her chart because she'd fired her. Wyatt told her that Meredith quit and it wasn't appropriate for her to show up unannounced. She told her to make an appointment if she wanted to unquit. Meredith later cornered Wyatt in a bathroom and was once again told to make an appointment. After Lexie ranted at Meredith and was overheard by Wyatt, Meredith agreed to an appointment at two that day. At the appointment, Meredith talked about her patient, [[Greta]], who had true love only because it was fake. Wyatt pointed out that Derek wasn't the one who gave up. It was her. She waited for him to fail so she could say that she quit. Wyatt again implied that Meredith was suicidal. She asked her about drowning in Elliott Bay and putting her hand in a body cavity that had a bomb in it. She was careless with her life, probably because her mother told her she was a waste of space and Meredith believed her. Meredith said she wanted her chart because if it said she was suicidal, it was wrong. Meredith left the session with her chart, telling Wyatt never to talk about her mother again. She later went back to Wyatt and told her that Ellis tried to kill herself after Richard left her. She'd never told anyone before. She then challenged Wyatt to fix her, because she said she's no quitter. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\nMeredith continued to tell Wyatt about her mother's suicide attempt. Wyatt told her it was okay to talk about it. Meredith said that her mother cut her wrists in front of her and then Meredith sat in a pool of her mother's blood waiting for her to pass out so she could call . It's not okay to talk about it. Meredith had to wait to call because Ellis had told her not to call before she cut her wrists, so Meredith knew she'd be in trouble if she tried to save her life. Meredith saved her life, even though she didn't want to be saved. She's angry, but not at her mother. She was angry at [[Richard Webber]] because he left her mother. Wyatt said that Ellis didn't want to kill herself and encouraged Meredith to think about it and figure it out. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nMeredith had trouble figuring it out. She said that Ellis had told her to be extraordinary. She became a surgeon, so she had all the tools she needed to figure it out. Later, while confronting Richard Webber, she figured it out. She hadn't been trying to kill herself because she would have cut her carotid artery if she were because it would have taken seconds. She just wanted Richard to come back to her, but he didn't know about it, so he didn't. Wyatt said it meant that Meredith was gifted like her mother, but she gets to learn from her mother's mistakes. Her mother wasn't talking about surgery when she told Meredith to be extraordinary. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nAfter moving in with Derek, Meredith came back to Wyatt and said she was finished. Wyatt said she was far from finished. Meredith left mid-session over Wyatt's objections.\n\nCristina came and spoke to Wyatt and begged her not to let Meredith quit therapy. Meredith later talked to Wyatt in an elevator and told her she wasn't done. She pointed out how Meredith was able to talk about her feelings, when she hadn't six months ago. She said her door was always open. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Flood]]\")''\n\n\nErica came to see Wyatt when she was being asked to operate on [[Walter Tapley]], something she didn't want to do out of fear she'd kill him. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\n\nOwen came to see Wyatt when he had PTSD in order to talk about his feelings. She tried to get him to realize that he was there because of what happened with his platoon. He later told Wyatt that he knew he was no good for Cristina and he ruined her. And he couldn't forgive himself for that. She said it was good that he was able to name his feeling, so he could start working through it. ''(\"[[Sweet Surrender]]\")''\n\nOwen and Wyatt worked together to think of three-word phrases he could say to Cristina instead of, \"I love you,\" because saying, \"I love you\" would be cruel. ''(\"[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]]\")''\n\nWyatt encouraged Owen to take things slowly with Cristina, meaning no sex. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\nOwen brought Cristina to a session with him. She told Wyatt things she knows about Owen, trying to convince her that they know each other. Wyatt said she wanted Owen to feel comfortable with her and that was the goal, not them just getting to know one another. Wyatt then asked if Owen talked to Cristina about his trauma, the war, or the choking incident. The PTSD was fed by his avoidance of talking about it. She didn't want them to get lost in the lust of it all and have him not talk about it.\n\nThey had another session together later and Cristina finally brought up the choking incident. Owen explained that it was a dream. He believed he was saving his own life and wasn't trying to hurt her. Wyatt said that was a start. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nFollowing [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] breakup with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and Derek dating [[Rose]], Meredith began to see Dr. Wyatt for sessions due to the fact she could not sleep. Meredith was unwilling to talk in her three sessions, having read that just the act of attending therapy can be helpful. But eventually she decided to talk to Dr. Wyatt and after a while she opens up about Derek's relationship with Rose, her family and eventually her mother's suicide. During the [[The Shepherd Method|clinical trial]] that Meredith proposed was taking place, Meredith found it difficult working with Derek and required some tools to get her through the surgeries that the trial involved. Following an argument over Meredith's feelings towards Derek and Rose's relationship and Dr. Wyatt's implication that Meredith was suicidal, Meredith fired Wyatt. Wyatt told Meredith that if she left she would be quitting but Meredith decided to stay and soon opens up and tells her for the first time that [[Ellis Grey|her mother]] attempted suicide ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''. Wyatt helped her explore her situation with her mother further and with Wyatt's help, Meredith realizes that her mother never meant surgery when she was told to \"Be Extraordinary\" and she was never really trying to kill herself. Meredith continued with her therapy but after Derek moved in and Meredith found she was happy with her life, she told Wyatt she was quitting. However, Wyatt insisted that Meredith's work wasn't done and they were only scratching the surface. When Meredith told Cristina about her plans to quit, Cristina approached Wyatt and asked her not to let Meredith leave. Saying barely a sentence to her, Dr. Wyatt knew it was Cristina, annoying Cristina that Meredith spoke about her in therapy, and became even more annoyed as Dr. Wyatt began to analyze her, proceeding to claim her to be a \"terrible shrink\". When Meredith soon met Wyatt in an elevator she realized there was misery all over the world and Wyatt said for the second time that Meredith wasn't done and her door is always open.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\n[[Erica Hahn]] went to her for a therapy session to receive some counselling and therapy into being able to operate on [[Walter Tapley]]. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nAfter assaulting [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] due to post-traumatic stress, [[Owen Hunt]] went to Dr. Wyatt. After a few sessions they started focusing on his feelings for Cristina and he couldn't say \"I love you\" to her so they started work on other three word sentences he could say to her such as \"Take care now\" and \"good work Yang\".\n\n\nDr. Wyatt is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].

The cause of the seizures was a mystery, so Derek recruited the interns to help him figure out the cause. Cristina and Meredith paired up to find the solution. While they were going over research and discussing various options, Meredith had an epiphany. She remembered Katie telling her about her previous fall. She believed that fall had burst an aneurysm. Derek had doubts, but agreed to check. He ran a scan and found out that Meredith was correct. Katie was bleeding into her brain, which caused the seizures. Meredith scrubbed in with him and they operated.

At the hospital, all the Chief candidates tried to suck up to him. He said that he'd vote for whichever of them fixed his problem and showed them his severely swollen testicles. He hadn't urinated in three days. They called urology to put in a supra-pubic catheter to drain his bladder and got an ultrasound and x-ray to determine the cause.\n\nThe x-ray showed what looked like a skeleton in his penis. Webber came in and said it was a candiru fish, which is known for swimming up streams of urine and lodging itself in the urethra. He was taken into surgery where the fish was removed and the damage to his bladder was repaired. During his surgery, he had a heart issue, so Burke monitored his heart while they operated. The surgery was successful and he was stable and awake afterward. ''(\"[[Desire]]\")''\n\n\nLarry went to Derek and said the board was meeting soon. He said he needed to know if Derek wanted to be Chief. Later, when he saw [[Callie Torres]] yelling at Richard on the catwalk, he made a disparaging comment about Richard's control of the hospital. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nLarry and the rest of the board started having secret meetings, drawing suspicion from the doctors in the hospital. Not longer after that, the announcement was made that [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] would be merging. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Cathy Becker]] died under suspicious circumstances, Larry, [[Richard Webber]], and a lawyer interviewed all the doctors who had worked in the ER that evening, trying to piece together exactly what went wrong. ''(\"[[I Saw What I Saw]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the Andersons pledged a $ million donation to the hospital, Jennings and Webber pressured [[Arizona Robbins]] into doing a surgery on [[Wallace Anderson]] that she didn't believe he was strong enough to survive. When Wallace later died, Jennings tried to suck up to the Andersons, but he was informed that Arizona was the reason they'd still be donating the money, not him. ''(\"[[Invest in Love]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard started drinking again, [[Meredith Grey]] eventually let Derek go to the board and Larry, along with a few others, confronted him about his alcohol abuse. ''(\"[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]\")''\n\nRichard was presented with two options: either he could take early retirement and relinquish his medical license or he could go to rehab and get his job back when he was done, pending board approval. He said he needed time to think. He ultimately decided to go to rehab. ''(\"[[State of Love and Trust]]\")''\n\n\nLarry was called in when Derek's Alzheimer's trial was compromised. He told Derek that Richard had confessed to tampering with the trial, letting Meredith off the hook. ''(\"[[She's Gone]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard stepped down and Owen was promoted to Chief of Surgery, Larry sent Owen a bottle of scotch to congratulate him.\ua''(\"[[Take the Lead]]\")''\n\n\nTeddy gave a presentation to the board, including Jennings, to try to get funding for her stem cell research. The presentation didn't go well, but Teddy got her funding when Owen put a good word in for her. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\n\n\nLarry married a woman named Nancy but five years before his hospitalization, he began to have an affair with his assistant, [[Celeste Newman]]. His assistant claimed that it was true love and their love was very rare and it was a bonus that they could work and play together although it bothered her that he hadn't left his wife, even after five years. His wife later showed up at the hospital and revealed she always knew about the affair. Larry's assistant quit and left Larry. His wife did the same.

''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, Leo and his sister, Allison, were left in the care of their grandmother as both their parents were working at the hospital with COVID patients.

Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted.\n\n\nIn April , Leo attended Maggie and Winston's wedding with Teddy and Owen.

''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\nTeddy and Owen spoke to [[Robin (I'll Cover You)|Robin]] about Leo and she said that they needed to look for insistent, consistent, and persistent signs from Leo and until then, to let him explore his gender.

But I still love you, whether you are capable of letting me or not. So, I forgive you.|'''Lexie Grey''' to '''[[Meredith Grey]]'''}}\n\n'''Lexie Grey''' was the daughter of [[Susan Grey|Susan]] and [[Thatcher Grey]] and half-sister of [[Meredith Grey]]. She was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] until she died in the [[Plane Crash|plane crash]]. After her death, the hospital was renamed after her and [[Mark Sloan]], the two fatal casualties from the plane crash.\n\n\n\nLexie was the daughter of [[Thatcher Grey]] and his second wife, [[Susan Grey|Susan]]. She had a younger sister, [[Molly Thompson|Molly Grey-Thompson]]. She also had an older half-sister [[Meredith Grey]], born to Thatcher and his ex-wife [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]], a famed surgeon. As a child, she was bright and skipped third grade. When she turned seven, her parents threw her a surprise party, which she always remembered as one of her best birthdays. She was very popular in high school, having a great group of friends, being crowned prom queen, and being class valedictorian. Near the end of Meredith's intern year, Thatcher mentioned to Meredith that Lexie was in medical school and that she soon had to choose a residency spot.\n\n\nWhen her mother Susan died of complications of the hiccups, Thatcher took to drinking and soon became an alcoholic. Despite this, Lexie stayed with her father and continued to care for him, even though he would often unreasonably and randomly lash out at Lexie.\n\nBy the time of Susan's death, both Lexie and Molly knew about Meredith's existence, though Lexie had never met Meredith before. On the day of her mother's funeral, Lexie waited in the car while Thatcher, accompanied by Molly, went to tell Meredith that she wasn't welcome at Susan's funeral, again missing the opportunity to see her older half-sister. After the funeral, Lexie went to Joe's bar where she offered to buy Derek a drink. He was visibly charmed and called her forward, to which she replied that she had a bad day, so she got to be forward today. He confessed to having had a bad day too but decided not to have a drink with her because he was there with some friends. They both agreed it was too bad, showing interest in one another.<ref>[[Testing --]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs Lexie started her internship, she met [[George O'Malley]] while he was cleaning out his locker in the interns' locker room. They quickly bonded and became friends. They even [[The Crapartment|moved in together]] after George's relationship with Callie ended. Lexie started having feelings for George, which he did not reciprocate. She called him out for not treating her better while she had always been there for him.\n\n\nWhen Lexie found out that she had a sister through her father, she began to have fantasies of getting along with her. Soon, she went to [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]] for her residency in hopes of meeting her. While Meredith did not appreciate Lexie's presence at first, over time, Meredith eventually tolerated her and accepted her as a sister. Lexie also confronted Meredith about her mistreatment of her on quite a few occasions, all with the good intentions of letting Meredith get to know her. After a very long time, Meredith began to care about her, and eventually admitted that she loved Lexie.\n\n\nWhile not part of the original group of interns practicing on each other, Lexie [[Rise Up|caught]] her fellow interns under Yang performing simple procedures on each other. Initially creeped out by the thought, Lexie tried to get cadavers for them to practice on, instead, but even these were stolen by their residents. Realizing that she wasn't learning enough from Cristina, she eventually joined the secret intern society, and the group soon grew as more dissatisfied interns joined.\n\nWhen Cristina and Meredith [[These Ties That Bind|suspected]] that she was cutting herself, she tried to shut down the group temporarily but was quelled by the new and enthusiastic member [[Sadie Harris]]. They were eventually found out by Cristina, who let them off with a warning. When Sadie told her that Meredith thought she was a priss, Lexie [[In the Midnight Hour|suggested]] that they perform an appendectomy on [[Steve Mostow|Steve]], who disapproved, but Sadie volunteered to take his place. However, the operation went wrong and she went to Meredith for help. After being discovered by the [[Richard Webber|Chief]], she and all the involved interns were put on probation by their residents and banned from surgeries.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Lexie and George]]\nLexie met George at the end of his first year as an intern,<ref>[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]], x</ref> and kept it a secret when she found out George failed his intern exam and had to repeat his intern year. They became good friends and even rented an apartment together. Lexie, however, began to see George as more than a friend, and while they became incredibly close, George did not see her the same way, so Lexie was constantly disappointed by George's lack of response to her signals and seeming unawareness to her feelings. \n\n\nLexie first came up to Alex one night when they were leaving the hospital. She initially asks for something more and Alex catches on and tells her that he's not that kind of guy. He tells her that he's the guy that people go to for the one-nighters and solely for the sex. Eventually, they do have it, in Alex's room that he's living in under Meredith's roof. She catches them in the act which unnerves Alex a bit. Later on, we occasionally see the two exchange kisses from time to time and go out to Joe's. In the resident locker room, Alex is caught in a 'feud' between the sisters. He says he won't continue messing around with Lexie because he doesn't want to be a part of their quarrel. Saying that he's not taking a side by refraining from messing around with Lexie, she says he clearly is. Then, Ava comes claiming she wants to see Alex perform surgery. He finds her a pair of scrubs and allows her to sit on the observatory deck while he surgically removes a man's sternum with the help of Dr. Hahn and Dr. Sloan. Lexie meets Ava and asks if she's here for Sloan, but Ava says no, she's here for Alex. She asks Lexie if she knew Alex and Lexie replies with \"No, I have no idea who he is.\"\n\n\nTo Mark, Lexie was \"forbidden fruit\", because she was Meredith's little sister and a \"fetus\", due to their large age gap. That's how she got her nickname '''Little Grey'''. Lexie came up to Mark and told him that the other interns were trying to take their mind off their so-called secret intern surgeries by having sex, but instead, she wanted to learn and asked him to teach her. Mark thought this was inappropriate, but let her be on his service on \"cappuccino duty\". Later that day, Lexie came up to his hotel room, took off her clothes, and said, \"Teach me\".\n\n\nMark and Lexie's relationship started to get troubled when [[Sloan Riley]], Mark's pregnant -year-old daughter, turned up at the hospital. Despite having a distant relationship with Sloan, Mark grew to become a caring father for his daughter. Since she was not ready to be a good mother for her baby on her own, Mark offered her to move in with him permanently so they could raise the baby together. Lexie confronted him and told him that she was not ready to start a family and be a grandmother yet. He begged her not to make him choose between his daughter and grandson and her, because, as Lexie figured, he'd choose for his daughter and grandson. This caused her to end the relationship with him.\n\n\nAfter Mark and Lexie broke up, she began a short relationship with Alex when she moved back into Meredith's house. They hooked up that day since Alex was missing Izzie as well. The relationship did not last long, however, as Lexie soon got back together with Mark.\n\n\nShortly before the shooting, Mark realized his feelings for Lexie. After Teddy broke things off with him, Callie told him that his jealousy was showing and was a sign he still loved her. He confessed his love for her and told her that she should choose him instead of Alex since he would marry her. She didn't have much of a response since Alex interrupted Mark's confession.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref> During the shooting, Mark and Lexie worked together to save Alex, who had been shot. Lexie told Alex she loved him, but Alex asked for Izzie, confused.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref> Ultimately, the two broke up. After the shooting, Mark took care of her and told Callie that he wanted to marry Lexie, but she persuaded him not to go to Lexie and propose.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref> Lexie thought that Mark's drive to bring her away from the OR was since he thought she wasn't stable after the shooting, but April told her that it was because he loved her. Lexie went to find Mark but found him kissing [[Amelia Shepherd]].<ref>[[Superfreak]], x</ref> Later on, Mark asked Lexie for a drink, which Lexie did her best to avoid. Even though she tried not to, Lexie went to Joe's and kissed Mark, which starts their relationship again.\n\n\nWhen Lexie broke up with Mark, she was feeling hurt and started a relationship with [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] until he realized that she obviously still had feelings for Mark. Unwilling to wait for her, he broke up with her.\n\n\nWhen Meredith and Derek agreed that the solution to their relationship troubles was for Meredith to stop being on his service, Lexie took her place as his resident. Hence, Lexie spent a significant amount of time on Derek's service. She was initially intimidated by Derek due to his exacting standards and quirks, once even asking Meredith to go \"have sex with him and make him nicer.\" Meredith would give her tips on how to get on his good side. Lexie and Derek tackled a number of hopeless cases together. \n\n\nShe was on a plane that crashed with [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], going to another hospital for surgery to separate conjoined twins. Suddenly, the back of the plane broke off and the plane crashed in the woods.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Mark finds Lexie trapped under the plane.]]\n\nA piece of the plane landed on top of her, crushing her pelvis and legs. Separated from the others, who were in the front part of the plane, she used a belt and knocked it against the piece of plane crushing her. Meredith, Cristina, and Mark followed the sound and found her. They concluded she was still awake and responsive, and an emotional Meredith went off to find Derek, who was still missing. Mark and Cristina tried to lift up the part of the plane, but without success. Lexie told Cristina her legs and pelvis were crushed and was doubtful if her left arm was still there. Mark yelled at Cristina to go get fluids and oxygen tanks from the plane, and even though both she and Lexie realized that Lexie was dying, she left to get the supplies.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Mark telling Lexie he loves her.]]\n\nWhile waiting for Cristina to come back, Lexie asked Mark to hold her hand and tell Meredith that she was a good sister. She also wanted him to tell something to her father, but Mark refused as he didn't want to accept that she was going to die. After once again unsuccessfully trying to lift the part of the plane on his own, he realized there was nothing he could do for her, and he did take her hand. He confessed that he loved her, and Lexie said that he didn't have to say it just because she did, but he insisted that he loved her. They fantasized about how they would get married and have kids, specifically a sister and two brothers, as siblings for Sofia. Mark said she couldn't die, as they were supposed to end up together. He told her that they were meant to be. \"Meant to be,\" she repeated with a smile. She then succumbed to her injuries, and a crying Mark closed her eyes with his one hand as he kept on holding her hand in his other hand. Seconds later, Meredith and Cristina appeared and they mourned her death together.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nTogether with the survivors, Lexie's body was taken out of the woods and transported back to Seattle. Cristina once told Owen about the nights in the woods, when she heard animals fighting and growling. She told him that she realized that they were fighting over Lexie's body and that she did her best to try and keep them off of her.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nDay of the Dead\nLexie was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nCovid-  Beach\nLexie appeared on Meredith's beach while she fought for her life. Lexie was joined by [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and together they tried to convince Meredith why she should keep living and not die.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and Lexie talk at Joe's.]]\nLexie came to Seattle for her mother's funeral and after, she went to Joe's. Like her sister, she met her future brother-in-law [[Derek Shepherd]] there and later discovered he worked at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\nVoted student body president, Lexie was popular by both peers and teachers at school. Her photographic memory also made her one of the brightest in her class and not only made her a natural in the OR but also meant she knew all the periodic elements which she tells Mark Sloan when having a drink at Joe's bar.\n\nAs an intern, Lexie was portrayed to be emotionally fragile and incapable of lying or covering up. She coped with her anxiety by rambling incessantly or snacking compulsively. She was liked by the attendings for her knowledge and good instincts, but her residents generally treated her as a scut monkey or their encyclopedia.\n\n\n\nWhen Carolyn Shepherd came to Seattle, she asked Lexie how many sexual partners she had, to which she replied that she had six or seven.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nLexie made her first appearance in Seattle Grace when she introduced herself to George.\n\nLexie learned that George was repeating his intern year and helped him keep the other interns unaware of his failure. She and George developed an unlikely friendship over intern struggles and their strained relationships with Meredith and Callie, respectively. Lexie was shown to have been smitten with George. Mark Sloan noticed this and vowed to be less mean to George if she'd admit her feelings to him. As a result, Mark was slightly more polite to the two of them and George misunderstood, thinking Lexie and Mark were sleeping together. Lexie continued to vie for George's affections.\n\nGeorge finally passed his intern exam and seemed to pay less attention to Lexie. The final straw occurred when he received his new interns and Lexie discovers he hadn't had the decency to even ask to have her assigned to him. She broke down in front of him, calling herself stupid and him a jerk. Lexie chose to forgive George and made a peace offering, keeping her feelings for him quiet.\n\nAs George was retaking his intern year and only Lexie knew, the two bonded and became best friends. Having parties with fellow interns such as [[Graciella Guzman|Graciella]], [[Megan Nowland|Megan]], [[Steve Mostow|Steve]], [[Pierce Halley|Pierce]], [[Claire (Intern)|Claire]], and later [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]]. She also moved in with George but later moved out when she felt lonely. Mark then insisted that Derek take her home.\n\n[[File:TeachMe(AllByMyself).jpg|thumb|left|Lexie undresses and asks Mark to \"teach her\".]]\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhile working with Mark Sloan, she developed an attraction, intensified by Derek's ban on them going out. Mark himself was initially reluctant out of loyalty to Derek, as she was the sister of his best friend's wife and their age gap. One night, Lexie went to his hotel room, stripped and says \"''teach me''\", they began a secret relationship. They grew close very quickly and Mark developed true feelings for her, but Lexie was tired of the secrecy and put their relationship on hold. Eventually, Mark told Derek and they began dating in public. Their relationship hit a small bump when Mark decided he did not want to go to dinner with her and Thatcher because fathers didn't like him, but in the end, he went. Another slightly larger bump happened when he suggested she move in with him into a condo he was considering buying, but she didn't think she was ready because she was so young. The conversation turned intensely awkward when Mark accidentally brought up marriage. Lexie told him that in five years she'd still be a resident, and he replied that there were plenty of residents that were married.\n\nWhen Derek performed a 'rogue surgery' on a patient with a highly complex \"inoperable\" spinal tumor and Lexie wanted to take part, Mark encouraged her with a huge smile and said \"''Go get your rogue on''.\", which hinted that they were in a committed relationship. When Mark's -year-old daughter, [[Sloan Riley]] arrives, she's supportive, even better than he was with dealing with it. But later on, she proves to have some difficulty when his daughter reveals she is pregnant and Mark offers to let her stay as long as she wants in him and Lexie will be there for her, entirely not consulting Lexie on the matter. And her being a grandmother at  is way too much for her to take, after an argument about it later, he asks her not to make him choose between her and Sloan (his daughter) Lexie asks \"''Why because you'll choose her?''\" and Mark responds \"''Yeah''.\" And Lexie says, tearfully, ''\"I think our relationship just ended''.\" Then she goes to Meredith's house and gets drunk, and has a discussion with Alex, leading to her sleeping with him. She later discovers that Mark slept with Addison, and he discovers she slept with Alex. He becomes angry at her for this.\n\nLexie began to date Alex after his divorce with Izzie. She becomes jealous when she finds out Mark slept with Reed. Later Mark tells her he still loves her, to which she replies \"''I have a boyfriend,''\" Mark tells her ''<nowiki>\"'</nowiki>'''I know. '''''I'm just saying you could have a husband.\" When the shooting happened, Mark and Lexie tended to Alex's shot wound. During this, Lexie told Alex she loved him, much to Mark's disappointment. Alex left Lexie after her breakdown, and Mark took Lexie to the psych ward. At Joe's, April tells Lexie that Mark loves her, that's why he always stares at her. Lexie then goes to his apartment, applies her makeup in the elevator, then is crushed to see him making out with Derek's sister, Amelia. Lexie and Mark continue to flirt. One day, he tells her he misses her. Then she asks him to talk to a nurse who hates her, to which he is willing to exchange for one drink. Upon seeing which nurse it is, he makes it two. She tells him \"''Fine''\" That night and tells Jackson to come in during the date telling her he needs her for something as an excuse to leave the date. Lexie arrives at Joe's later, tells him that it isn't fair for either of them since Mark is at a different point in her life than Lexie. Mark responds by simply kissing her, she kisses him back. Jackson arrives to pull her out of her date, and Lexie tells him to go, and she continues to kiss Mark. What Lexie doesn't know, is that Mark had a one night stand with Callie during their breakup, and Callie is now pregnant with his child. When Mark tells Lexie, she looks at him with disbelief and then storms out of his apartment. Mark wants to make things right, but Lexie won't talk to him, so he arranges for Jackson to find out what's bothering Lexie, in exchange for scrubbing in on his surgery. Lexie, with tears in her eyes, spills the beans to Jackson about how Mark has left her behind once again and does not care about how she feels. Jackson decides not to tell Mark because he feels like Lexie told him this in good faith.\n\nShe begins a relationship with Jackson but ends because he realizes she is in love with Mark. Mark was dating a doctor from another hospital, which made Lexie jealous. Lexie tries to tell Mark she still loves him, and after many fails, she does it, but he doesn't respond. When the plane crashes, and Lexie is about to die, Mark asks her to marry him, and says they will have children, after hearing this, Lexie dies.\n\nWhen Mark returns to the hospital, after the plane crash, Julia, his girlfriend was waiting for him, and she says she loves him, but he responds, \"I loved Lexie.\"\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nSince Mark was still in love with Lexie, he recruited Jackson and bribed him with surgery in exchange for information about Lexie. Jackson, however, began to have feelings for Lexie and the two began dating. Lexie told Mark that she was seeing someone else when they were at Callie's baby shower. He asked if it was someone he knew, but Lexie walked away. Eventually, Mark figured it out once the two went public with their relationship. Lexie and Jackson's relationship became complicated as Mark was Jackson's mentor and it became clear to Jackson that Lexie was still in love with Mark. Jackson ended it with Lexie, saying that he, \"chooses Mark\".\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex and Lexie slept together once when she first became an intern at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Then they later had a relationship that lasted until he called out for [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] after being shot and she was committed to the psych ward in the aftermath of the shooting.\n\n\n[[Thatcher Grey]]\nThatcher was a good father to Lexie, contrary to how he was with Meredith. As Meredith said, Lexie \"never saw his bad side.\" Even as Lexie discovered the way Thatcher treated Meredith, she still loved him. She protected Thatcher's reputation during his alcoholism following [[Susan Grey|Susan's]] death. Each time he visited [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], she was warm to him. She was annoyed when he began dating again. However, Meredith eventually told Lexie it wasn't worth being angry over.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith took an instant dislike to her half-sister, Lexie, upon her arrival. Meredith truly hated the enthusiasm Lexie showed trying to get to know her. Meredith, however, quickly realized that although she had reason to hate the idea of her, she had no reason to hate Lexie herself.\n\nInitially, she didn't like the way Lexie followed her or spoke to Derek about her. She claimed that Lexie was someone she never wanted to know, even trying to deny that Lexie was her sister. After a traumatic day, Cristina brought Lexie to Meredith's with her and Meredith made an effort to bond with her and they danced and drank tequila. The next morning, Meredith even tried to make breakfast for her, and Lexie was so enthusiastic that she ate it, despite knowing she would have an allergic reaction to the eggs.\n\nLexie and Meredith didn't get too close, as Meredith was over a surgical year older and they had two different sets of friends. As [[George O'Malley|George]] and Lexie's friendship phased out, Lexie gave up the apartment that the two of them had shared. She moved into the attic of Meredith's house, where she occasionally bemoaned the fact that she didn\ut have a proper room instead.\n\nOnce George died and Izzie left the hospital, the remaining residents became very close. Meredith and Lexie became so close that Meredith gave Thatcher a piece of her liver so that Lexie wouldn't lose her dad because Lexie wasn't a match.\n\nShe also sat with Lexie for  hours after she had a PTSD breakdown following the shooting and had to be committed to the psychiatric ward. After Meredith's miscarriage, Lexie got jealous over how April was close with Meredith. Lexie was ashamed over her jealousy, but Meredith was flattered and told her, \"You're not crazy, Lexie. You're a Grey.\"\n\nWhen the plane crashed, Lexie died as a result of the injuries she sustained and upon hearing this, Meredith cried hysterically.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref> While treating a patient who had similar injuries, Meredith obsessed over saving the patient's life. After successfully saving the woman, Meredith was talking to Cristina and simply said that \"Lexie's dead\". From this, it appears that Meredith has accepted the fact that Lexie is gone and is at peace.<ref>[[Beautiful Doom]], x</ref>\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nDerek and Lexie's bond actually began romantically. Right after the funeral for her mother and before Lexie began her internship at Seattle Grace, she actually asked Derek if she could buy him a drink. She, of course, did not know he was Meredith's at the time boyfriend.<ref>[[Testing --]], x</ref> This did not cause any roadblocks because as soon as Lexie realized who Derek was, she backed right off.  \n\nUnlike Meredith, Derek accepted Lexie as a sister from the beginning and repeatedly tried to persuade Meredith to be nice to her. Lexie saw him as a big brother and would seek his advice, often at the most inappropriate times. He also comforted and encouraged her after they were forced to send home a terminally ill young boy after discovering in surgery that his cancer was too advanced for them to help.<ref>[[Hope for the Hopeless]], x</ref>\n\n[[Zola Grey Shepherd]]\nZola is Lexie's niece. She babysat Zola while Meredith and Derek went out on [[All You Need is Love|Valentine's Day]] and presumably other various times. Lexie also referred to Zola as her \"favorite little niece\". Before she died, Meredith and Derek's will stated that Lexie would become Zola's legal guardian if her parents died.\n\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\nLexie developed a short friendship with [[Sadie Harris]] when she covered for Lexie, saying that she (Sadie) gave Mark Sloan a penile fracture, even though it was actually Lexie. She later guarded the door so Lexie could visit Mark in his room.\n\n\n[[File:Lexiewins.jpg|thumb|right|px|Lexie wins the intern competition.]]\nLexie graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]].

And you go from there.|'''[[Mark Sloan]]'''}}\n\n'''Mark Sloan''' was the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Plastic Surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. He is the father of [[Sloan Riley]] and [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]]. After his death, the hospital was renamed after him and [[Lexie Grey]], the two fatal casualties after the plane crash. \n\n\n\nMark was born in  to upper-class, but emotionally distant parents in [[New York|New York City]]. While working on a case involving a man's sleepwalking and his daughter's subsequent insomnia, Mark revealed that his own parents would often go out at night, leaving him to care for himself. As a result, he would turn on all the TVs and every light in the house, even those in the closets, but still couldn't sleep.\n\nLater, he revealed that he and [[Derek Shepherd]] were childhood friends and when Derek's mother, [[Carolyn Shepherd|Carolyn]], saw how lonely he was, she encouraged Derek to bring him home. This led Mark to develop a family relationship with the Shepherds, and become like a brother to Derek. When Derek's mother visited, she revealed that a -year-old Mark once put Derek's favorite frog into the microwave, to which Mark replied that he never pressed start.\n\nMark was an athlete in high school and played on the football team.\n\n\nShortly before Derek's move to Seattle, Mark and Addison were caught having sex in Derek's bedroom. According to Mark, Derek merely walked out, packed his things, and left. Derek later learned that they continued to see each other after he left. Part of the reason Mark moved to Seattle was to try to continue his relationship with Addison. Addison gave him an ultimatum: If he could go sixty days without sleeping with anyone else, she would consider dating him. However, when Mark saw Addison and [[Alex Karev]] coming out of an on-call room together, he realized that they had had sex, and lied to Addison that he had slept with someone to break the -day contract. He never revealed to Addison that he caught her.\n\n\nMark first visited Seattle to bring Addison back to New York. Shortly after arriving at Seattle Grace, Derek punched him, it is later revealed, while Meredith is cleaning his facial wound, that it was due to his even stronger feelings for Meredith rather than Addison.<ref>[[Yesterday]], x</ref>\uaMeredith and Mark only spoke to each other and Mark got punched,\uaMark and Addison had sex and Derek simply walked away and did not look back.\uaMark slept with Addison again before he intended to leave, but he stayed and became the Head of Plastic Surgery.\n\n\nMark was in the running for Chief of Surgery, along with Derek, Burke, and Addison. He got a idea from Bailey mentioning the hospital needs a \"right now\" plan, not a ten-year plan. Richard Webber told the other  that the board was eating up the \"right now\" plan, and suggested that they should do the same.<ref>[[My Favorite Mistake]], x</ref>\n\n\nMark had a sexual relationship with Callie Torres.<ref>[[What I Am]], x</ref><ref>[[Oh, the Guilt]], x</ref> Mark started flirting with Erica Hahn, which she rejected. Mark suggested having a threesome between him, Callie, and Erica. Erica said he would be intimidated by her and Callie's relationship, and kissed Callie before stepping off the elevator.<ref>[[Losing My Mind]], x</ref>\n\n\nMark and Lexie started their relationship off with Lexie going to his apartment, taking off her clothes and telling him to \"teach her.\" They then had sex. After that, Mark wanted to resist\uaLexie because of his promise to Derek but it proved futile. He and Callie tried to make a pact to not sleep with the hot surgical interns, but it falls through. At the end of the day Callie and Mark are side by side at the bar at Joe's. Mark decides he's going to pursue Lexie, but Callie still holds back from flirting with [[Sadie Harris]].\n\ua\nMark has reservations about Lexie's relative age and inexperience, but more so about breaking his promise to Derek. Especially when Derek is gearing up to propose to Meredith; Mark questions maybe breaking up with Lexie because\uahe can't sleep with any more of Derek's sisters.\n\nWhen Mark fractures his penis during sex, Lexie comforts him in the aftermath. Mark is initially humiliated and asks Lexie to leave, but after surgery they cuddle.\nLexie confronts Mark about keeping their relationship a secret. She's tired\uaof lying to the people close to her and says they need to go public.\ua\n\n\nDuring the hospital shooting, Mark and Lexie were at the nurses' station, where shots were fired by Gary Clark. Mark ran Lexie to the elevator, which had an unconscious and bloody Alex Karev in it. They brought Alex to a conference room, where they treated him until the SWAT team evacuated them.\n\n\nShortly after Arizona moved to Africa, Callie started sleeping with Mark. Callie got pregnant with Mark's baby and Mark decided he wanted to be part of this baby's life, because he didn't have the chance with his other daughter, Sloan. When Arizona came back to Seattle Grace Mercy West, she and Callie got into a car accident. Callie was badly injured. She had to have an emergency c-section at  weeks. She gave birth to a premature baby and named her Sofia. Sofia and Callie both survived. Mark helped raise Sofia with Callie and Arizona until his death.\n\n\nMark began dating an eye surgeon named Julia who worked at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]]. Once Lexie learned of this, she became jealous of their relationship. During a softball game, Julie began to taunt Lexie about her softball skills, causing Lexie to throw the softball at Julia, which injured\uaher.<ref>[[Put Me In, Coach]], x</ref>\n\nMark began taking an interest in Jackson because he wanted Jackson to choose plastic surgery as his specialty. Mark noted that Jackson was very good-looking like him, which is helpful in that field. Mark called the two of them the \"Plastics Posse.\"\n\n\nIn , while traveling to Boise, Idaho to perform a separation surgery of conjoined twins, Mark was in a [[Flight|plane crash]]. He, along with Meredith, Lexie, Cristina, Arizona, and Derek became stranded in the woods. Mark seemed to have escaped with only minor injuries at first, though after the death of Lexie, he became unresponsive. Cristina examined his chest to find major bruising. Cristina realized that he had a cardiac tamponade, fluid surrounding his heart. Meredith used a tube from a bottle that Derek and Cristina found to drain the fluid. Cristina, Meredith, and Derek were able to get Mark to the front of the plane where Arizona and the pilot were. Mark woke up and told Arizona that Lexie was dead, and that she was waiting for him. Mark tried to tell Arizona he would be okay when he died, but she told him that she, Sofia, and Callie were waiting for him, too.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nMark was airlifted to Idaho, then sedated and moved to Seattle Grace Mercy West. He spent two months declining until he woke up briefly. After that day, he fell into a coma. After thirty days, they turned the life support machines off and Derek and Callie sat with him while he died.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n\nDay of the Dead\nMark was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith's Beach\nDuring Meredith's COVID-induced coma, Mark appeared on her 'beach', alongside Lexie.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:Old-friends-again.jpg|thumb|left|px|Best friends.]]His friendship with Derek lasted throughout childhood and into their adult years and Mark was Derek's best man at his wedding to [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. He once joked that Derek is his \"better half, but not better looking half\". Their friendship was strained due to Addison's affair with Mark and the latter's relationship with [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]]. They are polar opposite personalities: Mark is usually happy-go-lucky and forgives Derek easily while Derek tends to brood and hold grudges.\n\nAs Derek and Addison's marriage became strained, Mark and Addison grew closer, and eventually Mark slept with Addison, only for Derek to catch them in the act. Derek subsequently left New York and later Addison followed suit, leaving Mark behind. He moved to Seattle to try to win them both back and in the end, he became good friends with both.\n\nAccording to his \"-dollar-an-hour shrink\", \"behind his rugged and confident exterior, he is self-destructive and self-loathing to an almost pathological degree.\" Mark has commitment issues, likely stemming from his emotionally challenged relationship with his parents, and his friendship with Derek was his single longest non-sexual relationship. He has a long history of womanizing and one-night stands, and is somewhat indiscriminate about his partners, admitting to affairs with not only Addison but also his tennis partner's wife. He has also slept with all of Derek's sisters at some point. However he generally keeps a distance from [[Meredith Grey]] out of respect for Derek, once even comforting her following her first break-up with Derek by telling her that they're now both members of the \"Dirty Mistresses\" club.\n\nMark is impatient and shows disdain for the responsibility of training interns, and \"berates and humiliates\", as described by [[Erica Hahn]]. He often had interns pick up his dry cleaning or get him coffee and mainly looked out for himself, ignoring Addison when she told him SGH was a teaching hospital. He is also intelligent and conniving, and not above using others to advance his own agenda.\n\n[[File:hugging.jpg|thumb|right|px|Mark congratulates Derek.]]\n\nMark first appeared in Seattle shortly after the bomb scare at the hospital with the sole intention of bringing Addison back to New York. During this visit, Meredith, Cristina, and Izzie discussed a nickname for Mark. They came up with such names as \"McSexy\" and \"McYummy\". Meredith was the one who came up with the name \"[[\"Mc\" Labeling|McSteamy]]\". From that moment on, the interns regularly used the nickname behind Sloan's back. He eventually found out about the nickname when Meredith, who was under the influence of painkillers, called to him ''\"McSteamy! Woo hoo!\"'' to which he replied, ''\"Is that what you're calling me now? McSteamy?\" ''She responded by saying, ''\"Yeah, but I don't think you're supposed to know that.\"''\n\nAddison rejected Mark's offer to bring her back to New York and Derek rejected his apology, leaving Mark to return empty-handed to New York.\n\nUpon his return, he was not warmly welcomed by Addison or Derek, although he desperately wanted to repair his relationships with both. He carried on a brief fling with [[Callie Torres]] before she reconciled with [[George O'Malley]], and developed a friendship with Meredith, although he hit on her before she and Derek resumed their relationship. Mark disliked Seattle, annoyed by the weather and the perceived inadequacies of the city in comparison to Manhattan, and was also discouraged by the continued strife among himself, Derek, and Addison.\n\nMark\us focus remains on repairing his relationships with Addison and Derek. In an effort to stray from the sexual nature of their past attempts, Mark entered a sixty-day abstinence pact with Addison with the agreement that if at the end of two months\u time they had remained celibate, Addison would agree to give a relationship with Mark another chance. However, thirty-two days into the pact, Mark witnessed Addison and Alex leaving an on-call room together, and realized what had happened between them. Hurt, he lied to Addison about breaking the pact. Mark and Derek remained estranged, but their relationship greatly mended, after Mark showed support and strength, while Meredith was fighting for her life.<ref>[[Some Kind of Miracle]], x</ref> After Addison left for Los Angeles, Mark and Derek have mended their relationship, and although the subject of Mark's infidelity is occasionally brought up, they have shown mutual respect for each other, and their respective surgical skills.\n\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Mark and Addison.]]\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nAddison, Mark and Derek were best friends. However, Addison felt that Derek was absent at home, and therefore slept with Mark, supposedly as a way of getting attention. After catching them in the act, Derek left New York for Seattle.\n\nAfter Derek declared his marriage to Addison and friendship with Mark over and left town, Mark and Addison lived together for two months. During this time, Addison became pregnant with Mark's baby. He was initially excited about the pregnancy, but Addison had an abortion after discovering that Mark had cheated on her and after a call from Richard Webber she left Mark to follow Derek to Seattle. Mark, however, remained sensitive to the date of Addison's abortion, but later admitted that he was not ready to become a father, and probably wouldn't have made a very good one at the time.\n\nLater, Mark followed them to Seattle to win them both back and tried to convince Addison that he loved her and her marriage was over because Derek was in love with Meredith. He went home without Addison, but after Addison found Meredith's panties in Derek's tuxedo, she called Mark for a \"transcontinental booty-call\". Derek came to apologize to Addison and found Mark coming out of the shower, at which point both Addison and Derek knew their marriage was over. After a quick trip back to New York to sublet his apartment and sell his practice, Mark took over the plastics program at Seattle Grace.\n\nMark tried to prove himself to Addison by abstaining from sex for sixty days. After discovering that Addison slept with Alex, Mark lied and said that he had slept with someone, thereby taking responsibility, and effectively ending their romance. They did, however, remain friends.\ua\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Mark and Lexie]]\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nMark decided to change his ways after the nurses started a campaign called ''Nurses against Mark Sloan'' and Miranda Bailey's defense was \"''He's a manwhore''\". He was single for a substantial amount of time, occasionally sleeping with Callie. Meredith started to worry that Mark was flirting with [[Lexie Grey]]. Derek told Mark to \"''keep little Sloan out of little Grey''\". However, Mark started to notice her and they began dating secretly with only Callie, Sadie, and Derek's mother aware of their relationship. When Addison came back to Seattle for a visit, she realized but Mark managed to keep her quiet. Their relationship continued, even after Lexie gave him a fractured penis.\n\nLexie soon grew tired of keeping secrets and told him she wasn't going to be his girlfriend until he told Derek. He confessed to Derek who eventually accepted it. Their relationship continued but things got awkward when Mark suggested they move in together, the subject moved to marriage and awkwardly they started to avoid each other. Mark decided to move on anyway and started looking for a house but Lexie told him he couldn't make her feel guilty.\n\nSometime after George O'Malley's death they moved in together. Later, however, Mark discovered he had a daughter, [[Sloan Riley]], who arrives seeking his support after becoming pregnant and being evicted by her mother. Mark permits her to move in with him, which angers Lexie. When Lexie makes it clear that she knew that Mark would choose his own daughter over her, she puts an end to their relationship. Sloan experiences difficulties in her pregnancy, so Mark takes her to LA to be treated. He and Addison once again sleep together, but when he comes back he tells Lexie because he doesn't want to lie to her and wants them to get back together, but when she tells him she slept with [[Alex Karev|Alex]], it puts an end to their relationship.\n\nDuring the hospital shooting, Mark helped Lexie save Alex, her new boyfriend. In the aftermath of the shooting, Lexie had a psychiatric episode and Mark had her committed to the psychiatric unit. Their friendship was strained. However, Lexie softened towards him when she learned that he was still in love with her. As Lexie went to talk to Mark about him still being in love with her, she saw Mark entering his apartment with Derek's sister [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], kissing her and ultimately having sex with her. When Callie's girlfriend, pediatric surgeon [[Arizona Robbins]], broke up with her, she and Mark had a drunken one-night-stand.\n\nShortly thereafter, he reconciled with Lexie, and the two got back together. Callie discovered she was pregnant with his child, and Mark was delighted, although he was conflicted because he knew Lexie did not want a child. When Mark revealed the news, she was ultimately dismayed and left Mark.\n\nAfter [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] and Lexie got into a relationship, initially Mark was jealous. He later gave them his blessing and told Lexie he would let her go. Lexie replied that she still loved him, but right now she needed Jackson to be happy. Mark only repeated that he would let her go.\n\nWhen Mark finally started dating again, Lexie was jealous. This even resulted in Lexie throwing a ball at Mark's [[Julia Canner|new girlfriend]] and mistakenly saying that she wished she could be in the OR with him when he was talking to his girlfriend on the phone.\n\nLater, Lexie finally told Mark that she was still in love with him. Mark told Derek that he was torn between Lexie, the woman he loved but who didn't want anything that he wanted, and [[Julia Canner|Julia]], who could give him everything he wanted. Mark and Lexie boarded the plane to Idaho with their feelings unresolved. After the plane crashed, Lexie was stuck under debris from the plane. Mark told Lexie that he loved her and that they were going to get married and have children, because they were meant to be. Lexie then died with a smile on her face. Mark broke down and held her hand for several hours after. He later suffered from a cardiac tamponade, which [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] (with [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]'s help) was able to resolve temporarily with some personal items that survived the crash. He fought for his life throughout the rest of their time in the woods, though he considered letting himself die, saying that he'll, \"''be okay. Lexie is waiting for [him].''\" Arizona reminded him that [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] was waiting for him to return home and that he had to survive for her sake.\n\nAfter they were rescued, Julia came to the hospital. She told him that she loved him, but he replied that he loved Lexie, therefore ending their relationship. Mark spent two months fighting to recover before falling into a coma.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nCallie and Derek watched over him. Before falling into a coma, Mark had signed paperwork stating that he wanted to be removed from life support if there were no signs of improvement after  days. When that time came, they took him off life support and he died.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nAfter Mark and Lexie's relationship fell apart, he began a sexual relationship with cardiothoracic surgeon [[Teddy Altman]], despite the fact she was in love with their SGH's [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]], [[Owen Hunt]]. They had a few weeks of dating, which seemed to be going well. Mark later slept with [[Reed Adamson]], as he and Teddy were not exclusively dating. There was no official breakup but they both stopped seeing each other.\n\n[[Julia Canner]]\nAfter Lexie and Mark's breakup and [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia's]]\uabirth, Mark hit a dry spell for a little while. He was so focused on being a new father that he didn't actively pursue romance. After he picked up an obsession with cooking,\ua[[Callie Torres|Callie]]\uasuggested that he find a new girlfriend. Julia works at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] and was part of the softball game between the two hospitals. She and Mark dated for several months, however it was quite obvious Mark was still not over Lexie, especially when she and Jackson broke up. In spite of this, Mark and Julia were quite serious.\uaThey even discussed having a child together. However, before that could happen, Lexie professed her love for Mark. Shortly after, Mark and Lexie\ua[[Flight|were in a plane crash]], in which Lexie died from her injuries, leaving Mark devastated. When Julia visited him in the hospital after the crash, he broke up with her, saying that he loved\ua[[Lexie Grey|Lexie]].\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nWhen Amelia came to Seattle to make good with her brother after he was shot, she slept with Mark Sloan the day before she left.\n\n\nMark attended medical school at [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], completed his residency in [[otolaryngology]], a fellowship in plastic surgery, and quickly became one of the most highly-regarded [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgeons]] on the East Coast with a thriving private practice.\n\nDuring a surgery with Mark Sloan, [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Erica Hahn]] commented on a technique that he was performing. Instead of using wires, he was using cables to repair his patient. He said that he learned this \"Tension banding\" technique back in New York after Columbia, when he studied under [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Crash Into Me, Part |John Seever]].<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref> \n\nProfessionally, Mark was regarded as a very successful and renowned surgeon and one of New York's finest plastic surgeons. [[Alex Karev]] referred to him as the \"go-to-guy\" for plastics on the East Coast, and Richard Webber proposed that the addition of Mark to Seattle Grace's plastics program would double the revenue of other departments. He is skilled at delicate and complex reconstructive procedures, but also performs cosmetic procedures. Of his personal philosophy, he says: \"People don't come to me to fix what's on the outside. They come to me to fix what's on the inside.\"\n\nBefore moving to Seattle, he owned a private practice with Addison Montgomery and Derek Shepherd. However, when they moved away he decided to win them back and sold the practice.\n\nAfter some time working at SGH, he considered terminating his verbal contract with Richard and moving back to sunny New York but he decided to stay after Meredith let it slip that Richard was retiring. Mark entered the race for the chief position and quickly gained the advantage when the others prepared ten year plans and he prepared a right-now plan (taking the words from Bailey). The board members and the chief applauded him, but in the end he failed to become chief. However, he stayed at Seattle Grace to work on his relationship with Derek and Seattle itself started to appeal to him too.\n\nMark began to take an interest in mentoring [[Jackson Avery]]. Derek surmised that his \"sudden interest in education\" was a result of him not being in a sexual relationship at that time. Jackson had initially been interested in neurosurgery, but later switched to plastics, much to his [[Catherine Fox|mother's]] chagrin. After Mark's death, Jackson took over their work.\n\n\n*To French viewers, Mark is known as Dr. Glamour, not McSteamy. To German viewers, he is known as McTraumprinz (Traumprinz roughly means \"Dream Prince\") or McSexy, and to Swedish viewers, he is known as Dr. Hot. In the Italian version, he is called Dr. Bollore (which means hot). In the Czech version, viewers know him as Mc\udhav\ufd (which also means hot). In Brazil, he's known as Gostos\ueo (which means super hot). In Finland, he's known as Kuumatohtori (which means hot doctor).\n*He didn't think arena football was real football.\n*His choice of coffee was a bone dry cappuccino.\n*He was not opposed to physician-assisted suicide.<ref>[[Suicide is Painless]], x</ref>\n*He shared his first and last name with the character Dick van Dyke played on \"Diagnosis: Murder\".\n*He had Chicken Pox when he was six.\n*Mark was \"[[Board Certification|double-board certified]]\" in [[Board Certification#American Board of Otolaryngology|ENT]] and [[Board Certification#American Board of Plastic Surgery|plastics]].\n**In the real world, this would mean that Mark had completed a five year residency in [[Otolaryngology]] and then a six year residency in [[Plastic Surgery]] because facial reconstructive surgery exists as a fellowship of [[Otolaryngology]], and not the other way around.\n*Mark was the interim [[Chief of Surgery|chief of surgery]] during [[Support System]].\n*He put [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] frog in the microwave when he was ten, but never turned it on.\n*He started to learn Spanish so that [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] could grow up knowing her heritage and culture.\n*He was on his high school football team.\n*He thought surprise parties were too hostile.\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nMarkSloan.png\nMarkSloan.png\nxMarkSloan.png\nxMarkSloan.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Mark-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Yesterday]]\n*[[In the Midnight Hour]]\n*[[Flight]]\n*[[Going, Going, Gone]]\n*[[Remember the Time]]\n\n\n:'''Mark:''' I love you.

They were trapped together during the shooting in the hospital.\n\n\n\nMary and her husband Bill came to the hospital so Bailey could perform a colostomy bag reversal surgery. She was told she couldn't have her second surgery because she needed a blood transfusion first. She hadn't eaten anything for quite some time, so she asked her husband to get her a pizza. While Bill was away, the hospital was put under lockdown because of [[Gary Clark]], who was shooting people in the hospital. Mary noticed something was wrong because her husband hadn't returned yet (he wasn't allowed to enter the hospital anymore) and Dr. Bailey kept hanging around in her room (because of the lockdown).\n\nHowever, Dr. Bailey refused to confess that there was something wrong until Charles Percy entered the room, saying the shooter was on the floor. Mary was really scared when Bailey looked through the window and saw Gary coming their way. She told Mary to play dead and covered her with the bed sheet. Charles hid himself in the bathroom and Bailey hid herself under Mary's bed.\n\nGary Clark entered the room and started crying because he thought the hospital had killed another patient, like his wife. He was about to leave the room when he heard a noise in the bathroom. He discovered Charles, who confessed he was a surgeon. Gary then shot him in the abdomen and also pulled Bailey from under the bed. However, she said she was a nurse and Gary left the room after reloading his gun.\n\nMary then finally could breathe again. Bailey then urged her to assist her while trying to keep Charles alive. Mary handed over supplies to Bailey. Bailey couldn't do much however, and they tried to drag Charles to an OR. Mary feared Gary might come back, but Bailey managed to calm her down. Bailey then talked Mary through helping her start to treat Charles.\ua''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nThey dragged the bleeding Charles to the elevators on one of Mary's sheets, but the elevators were turned off because of the lockdown. Realizing there was nothing they could do, they sat down to comfort a dying Charles. After an emotional conversation with Dr. Bailey, Charles passed away. After Gary had killed himself, the lockdown was lifted. Mary and Bill were reunited and hugged. Mary cried when Bill asked her if she was okay.\ua''(\"[[Death and All His Friends]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the shooting, Mary and Bill decided to travel. They went to Paris, Morocco, Alaska, and went on a cruise through the Baltic. ''(\"[[These Arms of Mine]]\")''\n\n\nSix months after the shooting, Mary and her husband were featured in a documentary about the shooting. Mary was followed by a TV crew on the day she was admitted to the hospital for a second time. Bailey and Mary were relieved to see each other again.\n\nBailey performed the colostomy bag reversal surgery flawlessly. However, it later turned out that Mary wouldn't wake up. Bailey sadly explained to Bill that it's very rare, but that it sometimes happen that patients don't wake up from the anesthesia after surgery. When her organs started failing, Bill decided to take her off of life support.\ua''(\"[[These Arms of Mine]]\")''\n\n\nFollowing her death, [[Jennifer Stanley|a pathologist]] performed an autopsy on Mary's body together with Bailey. Bailey constantly argued with the pathologist because she got really attached to Mary and she thought that the pathologist wasn't doing her job right. Sadly, the cause of her coma was never found and Bailey had to tell Bill that she had no idea why Mary didn't wake up after surgery.\ua''(\"[[That's Me Trying]]\")''\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Mary and Bill]]\n\nBill Portman\nMary married Bill and they were living a happy life together. Mary revealed in the documentary that they were thinking about having kids after the surgery. They never got to do that, as Mary was in a coma after surgery. Her devastated husband decided to take her off of life support after a couple of days when her organs started to fail.\n\n\n*When asked what she was looking forward to most after her surgery, she responded \"Babies, lots and lots of babies.\"\n*She was  at the time of her death.\n*Her bloodtype is most likely A, with an unknown Rh factor, as Charles can be seen holding a unit of type A blood when he's in her room.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref>\n*Dr. Bailey got very attached to Mary, which is very rare.

Drive to save lives, to make things better. And despite all that she's lost, she continues to find joy in her work as a surgeon, as a teacher, as a mother. And she managed to share that joy through her spirit of discovery and of possibility and of hope, right in the face of darkness.|'''[[Jackson Avery]]'''}}\n\n'''Meredith Grey''' is the [[Chief of Surgery]], former [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of [[General Surgery|general surgery]] and former [[Resident|Director of the Residency Program]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She is the daughter of the now-deceased [[Ellis Grey]], a famed general surgeon, and the now-deceased [[Thatcher Grey]]. She was married to [[Derek Shepherd]] until his death; they have two daughters, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] and [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], and a son, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]]. She has won a [[Catherine Fox Award]].\n\n\n\nWhen Meredith was young, her father, [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]], would bring her to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to visit her mother, [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]], at work. As a small child, Meredith got to see her mother perform surgery. As a gift, Meredith was given an \"[[Anatomy Jane]]\" doll by her parents, which contained  parts/organs to take out, and extra parts to simulate pregnancy. Meredith would bring the doll with her to the hospital. Years later, an adult, and now a doctor, Meredith uncovered the doll while she and Derek were unpacking boxes in their house, which was previously owned and inhabited by her mother and father before their divorce, and by her mother after, until Meredith was forced to place her mother in [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]], due to Ellis suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's. The doll brought up old memories for Meredith, along with a renewed attachment to the doll that resulted in adult Meredith bringing it to work with her one day. Upon recognizing an Anatomy Jane doll and her own remembered fondness for her own as a child, [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] allowed Meredith to scrub into surgery that day on a patient being treated for an inoperable tumor. During the surgery, it was obvious that [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] was quite disturbed, and also feeling a little guilty, at the sight of the doll, as he had been reminded of a young Meredith craving her mother's attention and love, yet not getting it since Ellis was not only very focused on her surgical career but also because he and Ellis were having an affair when they were both interns and residents. \n\nMeredith's parents had a troubled marriage, though part of this was due to [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]] spending too much time working and normal everyday problems. But a large part was due to the fact that for years, Ellis had been involved in an affair with one of her colleagues and best friends, [[Richard Webber]]. Their marital issues proved too great, and eventually, [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]] left the home when Meredith was five years old. He tried to visit her on several occasions, but he got nowhere. Eventually, he stopped seeing his daughter and subsequently started a new family with his new wife, [[Susan Grey]], and had two children.\n\nWhen Thatcher left Ellis, she continued her relationship with Webber, although he still had a wife, Adele. Although Richard tried to conceal his relationship with Ellis, Adele always knew, so if she was in their company, she would just play with Meredith. Eventually, Richard broke off his relationship with Ellis, as he felt he was being the better man, by walking away from Ellis, with Meredith only meters away, riding on a carousel. Meredith vaguely remembered her mother's pregnancy with Webber's child after he broke it off. In the memory, Ellis made it clear that she did not want to even look at the child. Shortly thereafter, Ellis accepted a fellowship opportunity at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She relocated to [[Massachusetts]] with Meredith, and Thatcher lost all contact with his daughter. As an adult, her only childhood memory of Thatcher was giving her cereal in the morning.[[Image:YoungMeredith.png|thumb|left|px|[[Time Has Come Today|Meredith as a child.]]]]\n\nIn the th grade, her English class had to read ''Romeo & Juliet.'' For extra credit, their teacher Mrs. Snyder made them act out all the parts. A boy named Sal Scafarillo was chosen for Romeo, and all the girls were jealous of Meredith, who was chosen for Juliet. But Meredith was not happy, and she complained to her teacher that Juliet was an idiot because she had fallen for the one man she knew she could never have. Then she blamed fate for her own bad decision. She told her that if Juliet was stupid enough to fall for the enemy, drink a bottle of poison and go to sleep in a mausoleum, then she deserved whatever she got. Therefore, at the age of , she was very clear that love, like life, was about making choices. Meredith later described her high school years to Cristina by saying, \"I wore a lot of black. Had the whole angry pink hair thing going on. Wouldn't have been caught dead at prom.\"\n\nShe went to college at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], and despite excessive drinking and partying, she graduated. Following her graduation, Ellis suggested that Meredith find another direction in her life, not being convinced that her daughter had what it took to survive medical school and make it in the surgical world. Following an argument about Meredith's future, Meredith spent two months traveling in [[Europe]] with her best friend [[Sadie Harris]], who also hated Ellis. But during that time, Meredith's mother Ellis Grey was diagnosed with early-onset [[Medical Glossary#A|Alzheimer's disease]] and placed into a nursing home in Seattle. Ellis's diagnosis gave Meredith the push she needed to go to medical school. After graduating from medical school, Meredith moved back to Seattle from Boston and into her childhood home in order to begin her internship at Seattle Grace. Meredith was the only one who knew about her mother's condition outside the nursing home staff, whose personnel were bound by contract to keep Ellis's condition confidential. Ellis also made Meredith promise not to tell anyone.\n[[File:Anatomy Jane.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith's \"Anatomy Jane\" doll.]]\nCristina later helped \"diagnose\" Meredith as having a case of \"severe abandonment issues,\" as the cause of her relationship problems with Derek, due to the fact that Thatcher left her, when she was a child, that she had to suddenly leave her childhood home when she was five, and that Ellis was absent for most of her childhood, due to her work and the affair she was having with Richard.\n\n\nAfter having a one-night stand with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] without knowing that he was her boss, she and Derek began dating, initially discreetly. But soon Bailey, Meredith's resident, caught her and Derek together and made it her mission to make Meredith's life at work as miserable as possible, as she was involved with her boss, who was also Bailey's boss. Meredith soon learned that Derek was still married when his wife, [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]], came to Seattle to get Derek back. At first, Meredith was angry with Derek for not telling her, but she later admitted to still loving him and begged him to \"pick me, choose me, love me.\" When Addison handed him the divorce papers to end their relationship officially, Derek remained hesitant and soon after decided to stay with Addison, much to Meredith's dismay. Although the two constantly flirted and Derek still hinted at having feelings for her, they both agreed to remain friends, and Addison, too, attempted to be friends with Meredith.\n\nWhen Derek's best friend, [[Mark Sloan]], visited Seattle, he was quick to realize that Meredith was \"the one\" for Derek and tried to persuade Addison to stop fighting for her marriage as Meredith was Derek's, true love. Meanwhile, Meredith rescued a dog, [[Doc]], in an effort to move on, but after her housemates, Izzie Stevens and George, gave her an ultimatum to choose them or Doc, she gave the dog to Derek and Addison. Doc was taken to the vet and diagnosed with bone cancer. Meredith started to date Finn the vet, much to Derek's annoyance. Meredith dating Finn also caused Derek to end the friendship with Meredith and call her a whore.\n\nOn the night of the Seattle Grace Hospital Prom, Derek went with Addison, while Meredith went with Finn. The two soon after met with each other in an exam room where Derek confessed that he still loved her and they had sex. Addison discovered Meredith's underwear in Derek's pocket and the two finally agreed to divorce. Meredith, however, was still dating Finn and issued a contest between the two boys to see which she would settle with. She ultimately chose Derek and they reconciled. \n\n\n[[File:xDrowningmeredith.jpg|thumb|xpx|Derek saves Meredith from almost drowning in Elliot Bay.]]\nMeredith, Izzie, George, Alex, and Bailey went to the site of a massive [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] accident. After Meredith finished stabilizing a patient's badly wounded leg with the help of a little girl just by the water, the man panicked and pushed Meredith off the edge into the bay. Later, when Derek was shown Meredith's fate by the little girl, he jumped into the water and then retrieved a pale, seemingly lifeless Meredith. He tried to perform CPR in the ambulance, but she did not respond. The doctors all tried to revive her, but she flatlined. Then Meredith entered a state of limbo in her mind, where she interacted with deceased acquaintances like [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny]], [[Dylan Young]], [[Doc]], [[Bonnie Crasnoff]], [[Elizabeth Fallon|Liz Fallon]], and her own mother, [[Ellis Grey]]. Eventually, she left this state of limbo and came back to life slowly. Meredith recovered, but Derek remained concerned that Meredith was a good swimmer, and that perhaps she had not tried hard enough and had given up.<ref>[[Walk on Water]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen one of Derek's patients, [[Jen Harmon]], found out that Derek was going to propose to Meredith, the two started to become friends and she wanted to help with the proposal. When she died, Derek blamed himself for her death. He ended up quitting his job and he moved back into his trailer. Richard told Meredith later that day that Derek was going to propose to her. Later that night, Meredith went to the trailer to find Derek drunk and hitting empty beer cans into the woods with a baseball bat. They started to argue and Meredith said, \"I know there's a ring!\" Derek froze. Meredith then told him that the chief had told her about the ring and that she was not going to give up on them. Derek then hit the ring into the woods. The next time Meredith went to see Derek at the trailer, she told him Izzie had metastatic melanoma and that it spread to her liver, skin, and brain. And that he was the most qualified surgeon to remove the tumor. Derek later asked Meredith to marry him, but she rejected his proposal. Derek ended up going back to work and removed Izzie's brain tumor successfully. That night, Derek proposed to Meredith in the elevator, which was decorated with surgical scans from their past cases. This time, Meredith accepted.<ref>[[Elevator Love Letter]], x</ref> Izzie Stevens began to plan the wedding, but right before, Derek and Meredith decided to give the wedding to her and Alex Karev.<ref>[[What a Difference a Day Makes]], x</ref> Later, Derek and Meredith got married in the resident's lounge, on a blue Post-It note from Cristina Yang.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Meredith was treating a John Doe, who soon would be identified as [[George O'Malley]], he attempted to write on a pad before surgery but wasn't successful. While recovering in the ICU, he attempted again to write on Meredith's hand, and she soon realized that it was George after he traced \"\" on her hand multiple times. Meredith was alarmed and alerted the other doctors, who originally believed her when he was taken in for brain surgery. During George's brain surgery, his brain swelled and he was declared brain dead. Lexie thought it wasn't George because she didn't think he was tall enough, so Callie checked for a Texas-shaped birthmark on his hand, which she saw, confirming it was George.\n\n\nDuring the start of the merger with Mercy West Medical Center, Meredith was hospitalized from having donated a portion of her liver to her father, Thatcher Grey, since he was unable to be placed on the transplant list due to his alcoholism.<ref>[[Tainted Obligation]], x</ref> Richard's drinking escalated again, causing him to make an error during surgery which almost killed a patient, until Dr. Bailey stepped in, fixing the problem<ref>[[New History]], x</ref> and scheduling weekly followups with the patient to ensure he had no lasting effects.<ref>[[Blink]], x</ref> Richard's alcoholism led him to do one-on-one teaching sessions where he showed Meredith various surgical techniques and she discovered his drinking again.<ref>[[Holidaze]], x</ref> She kept this from Derek, but he became very angry with Meredith and made her tell him what was going on.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref> When Derek found out about the drinking, he reported Richard to the board, forcing him to either step down from surgery and go to rehab or retire. When he chose rehab, Derek was named the interim Chief of Surgery.<ref>[[State of Love and Trust]], x</ref>\n\n\nNear the end of their third year of residency, Meredith revealed to Cristina that she was pregnant. She also planned on telling Derek, but the mass shooting intervened. The husband of a deceased patient, [[Gary Clark]], entered the hospital and shot many people, killing many, including [[Reed Adamson|Dr. Reed Adamson]] and [[Charles Percy|Dr. Charles Percy]]. The hospital was placed in lockdown while the shooting occurred. Gary Clark also shot Derek in the chest while Meredith watched from afar. Cristina had to do his surgery herself after barring Meredith from the OR. When the shooter entered the OR, Meredith entered too and told him to shoot her. However, he ended up shooting Owen, though his injuries were comparatively minor. While tending to Owen's injury, Meredith suffered a miscarriage.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the shooting, all involved were made to go through a psych consult to be cleared for surgery. Meredith was the last one to be cleared. She was cleared by Dr. Andrew Perkins only after she admitted her pregnancy and miscarriage.\n\nDerek began speeding to cope with the trauma and was arrested several times for \"reckless endangerment.\" The only people that knew about Meredith's miscarriage were Cristina, Owen, and April. Meredith ended up leaving him in jail on the night of Cristina and Owen's wedding. The next day, angered at having been left in jail overnight, Derek had an argument with Meredith in the hospital hallway. Derek tried to calm Meredith down and Meredith admitted that she had been worried about him since he started speeding and the only time she got relief was when he was in jail because she knew he was safe. She then told him about her miscarriage. Derek and Meredith kissed and hugged, and Derek agreed to drive more carefully from that point on.\n\n\nThe couple had recently been told that Meredith had a hostile uterus and conceiving a child would be difficult. Meredith and Derek met Zola when she was brought to the hospital for a spina bifida operation as part of Alex's program. Derek immediately bonded with Zola and suggested adoption. Meredith took a little longer to bond with Zola, but eventually, she was unable to avoid falling in love with the child. However, Derek found out that Meredith had tampered with his Alzheimer's trial just as the couple was granted temporary custody of Zola. When the social worker on their case, Janet, discovered that Meredith and Derek weren't living together and that Meredith had been fired, red flags were raised in the system. Fearing that she would lose Zola, Meredith hid with Zola in the basement of the hospital for  hours. Zola was taken away from them for a time, during which Meredith and Derek rekindled their relationship. They were given a date to see a judge about the adoption after Alex went to the judge directly. That date was subsequently canceled and Janet told them that it was unlikely that it would end in their favor and suggested that they move on. But the decision did end in their favor, and Janet brought Zola to them, finalizing the adoption.\n\n\nAt the end of her residency, Meredith, along with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], was involved in a plane crash on the way to Boise to help in a conjoined twins case. Lexie died due to a part of the plane crushing her, and Meredith was horrified and mourned. The plane crash also led to Mark's death, Arizona's loss of her leg, and Derek's severely damaged nerves in his hand.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nThe group ended up spending four days out in the woods before they were found and airlifted to [[Boise Memorial Hospital]], where they were treated before being sedated and flown back to Seattle.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nAll the survivors of the plane crash filed a lawsuit against the plane company. Their attorney informed the survivors that they would be pursuing action against the hospital instead of the plane company since the hospital put them on the plane. This alarmed the doctors. However, they decided to go ahead with the lawsuit, because Derek went to see the plane wreckage and believed if they settled, they wouldn't properly investigate what went wrong so it couldn't happen again to someone else.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors went to trial and were awarded $ million each. Callie decided that their win should be celebrated, and Meredith, Derek, Callie, Arizona, and Cristina all went to dinner to celebrate, where Meredith revealed that she was pregnant.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\nDuring Meredith's pregnancy, [[Alana Cahill|Dr. Alana Cahill]] was brought to the hospital to assess efficiency, as the plane crash verdict forced the hospital into bankruptcy after its insurance refused to pay the penalties after finding a loophole.<ref>[[Walking on a Dream]], x</ref> The doctors learned that Dr. Cahill was planning to clean up the hospital so that it could be sold to a company called Pegasus Horizons. But Richard and Callie conducted additional research of the company and learned that it would be a terrible asset to the hospital.<ref>[[The Face of Change]], x</ref> They brought the survivors together for a secret meeting and discussed purchasing the hospital so they could maintain the hospital in which all the doctors had been trained and which they still loved.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors went to investors looking for a partner to come up with enough money to purchase the hospital. After exhausting all their other investment options, they eventually were given $ million by the Harper Avery Foundation to purchase the hospital. The Harper Avery Foundation, led by [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]], made Jackson Avery their spokesperson on the board,<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref> which upset all the other doctors. They, however, all resolved the conflict when Jackson tried to bring the board together by proposing the hospital be renamed to reflect their beliefs and reasoning behind purchasing the hospital in the first place. This resulted in Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital being renamed to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in , after Lexie Grey and Mark Sloan, the two fatalities of the plane crash.<ref>[[Transplant Wasteland]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite Derek's warnings to slow down, a heavily pregnant Meredith couldn't keep from joining in on a surgery at the beginning of the superstorm. However, Meredith was forced to leave when there was a risk of explosions in the OR. She talked to [[Alex Karev|Alex]] about beating up [[Jason Myers]], only to find out that [[Jo Wilson|Jo]] was the one who had beaten up Jason. She followed Jo into a staircase, where Jo promised she would never let Alex take the fall for what happened to Jason. As Jo left, a construction worker told Meredith that they were done with the grinder in the OR. \"Then why aren't I up there?\" she angrily asked, and as she ran up the stairs, she slipped and rolled down the stairs. She sent Derek a message and got checked out by [[Connie Ryan]], and she promised that everything was fine with the baby. While the surgeons were preparing the hospital and the storm hit Seattle, Meredith's water broke.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was admitted but had to wait for Connie, who was busy with other soon-to-be mothers. Cristina, who found it typical for Meredith to go in labor during a superstorm, stayed by her side while Derek went to look for Connie. He found her, but as she did a check-up on Meredith, she told them that there was face presentation. As she mentioned that a C-section was necessary to deliver the baby safely, the lights went out and the back-up generators failed to engage. Even though they were, at first, hesitant to perform surgery in the dark, they realized there were no other options. The surgery went well, and Derek took his newborn son to the NICU to make sure everything was fine. While closing up, Connie got called away for another mother in need, and she and Meredith trusted Shane to close up. However, Heather and Shane discovered heavy bleeding, and Meredith realized that she had suffered an internal bleed from her fall on the stairs. Before losing consciousness, Meredith instructed Shane, who had found out that her spleen was bleeding, how to stop the bleed. Meanwhile, Heather went to find Dr. Bailey to assist them. Bailey overcame her fear to operate and pulled Meredith through. Meredith was kept in the OR until she was stable and later moved to a room in the maternity ward, where Derek and Zola visited her and their new family member.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a board meeting in her room, the others informed Meredith what had happened during the superstorm. She tried to help out as much as she could, but Derek and the others told her to rest after her major abdominal surgery. While the others left, Cristina stayed behind to chat a little until she got paged. Though it was said at the meeting that the ER had to close, Meredith got confused when she witnessed Stephanie and Jo exchanging supplies to use in the ER. When a stressed Alex entered her room, Meredith managed to calm him down by letting him hold her son. He told her about Richard and Heather, and he gave the baby back to her so she herself could recover her own calm. Meanwhile, Cristina and Bailey started arguing over the course of treatment for Richard, only to find out that Richard had listed Meredith as his medical proxy, which in turn had forced her to choose between Cristina and Bailey's plans. She decided to do so by relying on science and asked to rerun some tests. While waiting for the results, Callie sat down in her room to have a little chat about how she was doing. When Richard's results came back, Meredith decided to side with Bailey and allowed her to operate, which Cristina had advised not to be done. While Bailey operated on Richard, Meredith asked Cristina to admit that the decision was right, and Cristina did.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith later talked with Cristina and Alex about Richard's decision to make her his medical proxy, wondering if she was in his will too. After Richard's surgery, Owen came to Meredith's room to tell her that Bailey had closed Richard back up once [[Catherine Fox|Catherine]] started yelling at them from the gallery. Meredith also consoled a sad Derek, who had lost Heather in surgery. After Meredith ordered Derek to go home with Zola, who had spent enough time in daycare now, Callie and Sofia came in to drop off some things. Callie told them that she had moved out of the apartment and that they would stay at a hotel for a while. Meredith decided to let Callie stay at their house, and she later told Arizona, who had no idea where Callie and Sofia were, that they were at her house. While trying to fall asleep, the interns bothered her to ask for help finding Heather stories to tell Heather's mother, and Meredith told them what she had told George's mother after he died. When the interns left, Jackson came in to tell her that his mother was planning on moving Richard to another hospital. Alex and April came in too to talk about their problems, and as they left one by one, they all refused to bring her a wheelchair. However, she somehow got herself a wheelchair and went to Richard's room in the ICU with Bailey. Bailey still thought that they should open him back up, and Meredith made the call to book an OR for Bailey. Later, back in her room, Cristina and Alex talked with Meredith about medical proxies, and it turned out that Cristina had actually disapproved of Meredith's decision for Richard. After Bailey's surgery, Catherine still wanted to have a second opinion. Meredith told her that Richard chose her to make his decisions, and not Catherine. They started arguing as Richard opened his eyes, and Meredith enthusiastically greeted him.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite his promise to Meredith to take care of the kids so that she could have a year to focus on her work, Derek started to consult on a time-consuming brain mapping project for the White House. The presidential team asked him to become more involved in the project, but he initially refused the offer in an attempt to keep his promise to Meredith. While at April and Matthew's wedding, Derek received a call from the president himself and ended up accepting the offer to put his name on their federal research initiative.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\nThis caused Meredith to become upset with him since she had wanted to continue with her own research work. Derek later learned that the federal team wanted him to run the project's advisory board. While on a trip to Washington, D.C., Derek was offered a full-time job at the National Institutes of Health, and he found a job for Meredith at James Madison Hospital.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Meredith later told Derek that she refused to leave Seattle after Cristina reminded her not to let what Derek wanted eclipse what she needed. Forced to choose between his family and the brain mapping job, Derek decided to stay in Seattle as well and rejected the offer.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, there was excessive tension between Meredith and Derek. Derek was unsatisfied with his job at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, especially because his sister Amelia had taken over as head of the neurosurgery department.\n\nMeredith was upset with Derek for being so attached to the federal initiative position and told him that she never wanted him to give it up for her. [[Deborah Curzon]], a special assistant to the president, came to Seattle in a last attempt to recruit Derek for their team. Derek told her that he was unfortunately unable to accept the offer, but he took her card anyway. Later that day, he got into a fight with Meredith, who told him to take the job in D.C. and leave. Derek called the woman he had spoken to earlier and told her that he did want the job after all.<ref>[[Risk]], x</ref>\n\nHe packed some clothes and went to the airport while Meredith threw away the Post-it note that had signified their marriage. The next day, Meredith and Derek talked on the phone and decided that they can make their relationship work, even if Derek had to take the job with the president. She then took the Post-it note out of the garbage and hung it back up on the wall. After a couple of weeks of Derek in D.C., he came home to Meredith and said that he thought D.C. was everything, but he was wrong. Derek told her that her, Zola and Bailey were everything. Derek told her that he couldn\ut live without her. Meredith replied that she could live without him but that she didn\ut ever want to. The two then hugged and made up. Derek moved back home.\n\nWhen Derek moved back home after being in D.C. the two were lying in bed and Derek told her that she was always the one. He told her that she truly did save him. He also told her that he wanted more with her. Meredith then went to work telling friends that she was happier than ever with her husband and children.\n\nWhen Derek was leaving to hand in his resignation to the White House, he told Meredith to stay and wait for him, just like when he left her at the house of candles so he could break up with Rose. Meredith and Derek kissed and he left. A couple of hours later, Meredith got a call that Derek never showed up for the meeting in Washington D.C.. Meredith soon began to worry about what happened to him. Just as she picked up the phone to call the police, the police came to the house asking if it was the home of Derek Shepherd. She replied yes that\us my husband. Meredith then was told there was an accident.\n\n\n[[File:Meredithsayinggoodbyetoderek.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith says her last goodbye to Derek.]]\nDerek was involved in a car accident with serious injuries. Ultimately, he was declared brain dead, and Meredith had his ventilators turned off. He had been on the way to the airport for a final trip to D.C. where he would wrap up his work and hand in his resignation. After Derek died, Meredith took Zola and Bailey and left Seattle in the middle of the night, much like her mother did with her when she was a child. All Meredith left was a note saying that she and the children were safe. Her friends tried to contact her repeatedly, but she didn't answer. It was later revealed that she moved to San Diego for one year. Finally, Meredith answered on Thanksgiving, telling Alex to stop calling her, that she and the kids were fine.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith put out feelers with a real estate agent to see whether anyone would be interested to buy her house. But she forgot to inform Amelia, which sparked a fight between the two. Amelia was mad at her for not having called her before pulling the plug on Derek, so she couldn't say goodbye. Meredith broke down after the confrontation. She later went to Alex and explained that her house didn't feel like her home without Derek, so she asked if she and the kids could stay with him and Jo for a while. He agreed to that,<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref> but Jo got mad at him for not consulting her first. Meredith felt guilty about forgetting that Amelia was also supposed to be her sister, and gave her her old phone with Derek's last voice mail message. Later that day, she intervened when Catherine and Richard were too angry to get married. Meredith played the dead husband card and got them to the altar after all. That evening, Meredith hosted a party for the newlyweds at her house. At the party, she told Maggie, who was upset about her own parents' divorce, that she could always come to talk to her, about anything. Amelia joined them as Meredith said that a house filled with happy people would be the perfect last memory, as that had been what Derek had wanted. She took Amelia and Maggie's hands and they went inside to dance it out together.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\nAs Jo found a loft for the two of them, Alex moved out of the house and sold it back to Meredith, who moved in with her kids and sisters. The sister started carpooling to work, and Meredith started to teach an intern anatomy class at the hospital. Initially, there were some tensions among Meredith and Amelia, including an argument over whether or not they were going to tear down the wall between the kitchen and the living room, as a drunk Meredith had mused about. Maggie intervened to call a truce. Meredith and Amelia apologized to each other, and Meredith admitted she doesn't know how to talk to Amelia as she's a lot to handle sometimes, and Meredith doesn't totally like her. However, she considered Amelia family, so she didn't have to. She then decided it was okay to tear the wall down.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a busy day where Bailey, the new Chief, dumped all her patients on Meredith, Bailey rewarded Meredith with a promotion to Head of General Surgery.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref> However, Bailey made Meredith an offer with a low salary. After consulting with other department heads, Meredith stood up for herself and asked for the salary she deemed fit. It turned out that Bailey was actually testing her to see if she would stand up for herself and agreed to Meredith's request.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen [[Nathan Riggs]] arrived at the hospital, it did not take long for Meredith to discover the reasons regarding his feud with Owen. Out of loyalty, Meredith asked Owen if they hated Nathan, to which Owen said yes.\n\nThe day Owen sold Derek's trailer, Meredith witnessed Amelia being happy in her new life with Derek's job and a possible engagement to Cristina's former husband. This all resulted in a particularly bad day for Meredith, resulting in her snapping at everyone in the OR, including Nathan. Alex later told her not to crap on everyone's life just because she was choosing to be unhappy and pointed out she had choices. Later that night in the parking lot, Nathan brought up her behavior and that he understood the way she felt about living a life without Derek, comparing it to Megan's disappearance. Things got heated and resulted in her kissing him, which led to them hooking up in her car four times in one night.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Owen and Amelia's wedding, Meredith and Alex talked about possibly having only one true love in your life. At work, Meredith made it clear to Nathan that she didn't want him to get too attached, which he assured her he wasn't.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie confesses her crush on Nathan.]]\nShe then went to the church to get Amelia down the aisle, which included a quick getaway and more debating about having one true love. Meredith concluded it would be better if you believed you can have more than one. This led her to open up to Nathan shortly before the ceremony when they discussed her wedding and his wedding plans with Megan. During the ceremony, Nathan gave Meredith a loving look. However, Maggie misinterpreted his look as being for her, and she confessed to Meredith that she had a crush on Nathan, leaving Meredith in an awkward situation.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nAt the wedding reception, Nathan invited her to dance but she declined. As he was suggesting they get out together, Maggie interrupted and ended up dancing with Nathan. Meredith continued to avoid Nathan after Maggie's confession and told him they had a problem. Before she could elaborate, Jo called her about Alex assaulting Andrew. She went to the hospital to check on Andrew's status and, knowing what really happened, kept Alex updated on Andrew while lying to Maggie about what had happened to Andrew. She and Ben both knew that Alex was the culprit, but she kept protecting Alex to make sure his good side would win. She learned the truth about DeLuca being with Jo through Stephanie and went to tell Alex, who had thought that DeLuca was raping a drunk Jo. She advised Alex to go and tell Bailey what happened, but he went to try and stop Andrew from pressing charges.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Nathan supports Meredith.]]\nNathan found her sitting in a lounge and sat with her at her request as she decided to tell Bailey the truth. She did so, but Alex turned himself in before Bailey could have him arrested. Maggie was upset when she learned that Meredith had lied to her. Meredith said she just did so because they were still figuring things out and promised not to lie to her anymore, like a real sister. However, she immediately broke that promise when she hid the fact that Nathan came to see her that night, asking about the problem she had mentioned as he really felt something between them. She replied someone would get hurt and, since Nathan brushed it off, then lied and said she didn't feel the same way about him.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie later told her about her recurring sexual dreams about Nathan and decided to ask him out like a grown woman ready for her big love. Meredith then accompanied Alex to the courthouse, where he was charged with felony assault in the second degree. This made Alex think of himself as just another piece of trash but Meredith reminded him of his career and remained confident that he wouldn't go to prison. In surgery with Maggie, Owen came in to invite Meredith for a housewarming, and Maggie volunteered to come after finding out Nathan would be there. Meredith later rode an elevator with Andrew and talked about how she was assaulted and forgave the man who did that to her. She added he should be focused on surgery instead of the case, which he interpreted as a threat.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith at the dinner party.]]\nMeredith arrived at the dinner party and she made Owen give Maggie a tour so she could have a private talk with Nathan. She told him Maggie was going to ask him out and she asked Nathan to decline nicely, which Nathan took as a signal that Meredith herself felt something for him, which she denied. At the party, she also asked Jo to talk to Alex even though Jo was more concerned about Andrew. Later at the hospital, Bailey confronted Meredith about her threat to Andrew and warned Meredith not to go down with Alex, but Meredith insisted on standing by him. She and Bailey then had to operate on Alex's patient following a mistake he made, and Meredith invited Andrew to scrub in to clear the air between them. Back at home, Alex told Meredith about Bailey's decision to let him work in the clinic and that he supported that decision because his head wasn't in the game. Meredith then told him about her sleeping with Nathan, just before Maggie came in and told them Nathan turned her down. However, she didn't plan on giving up since he just told her he wasn't dating right now.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey and Catherine brought [[Eliza Minnick]] to be the new Residency Program Director, effectively firing Richard from the job. When Meredith refused to allow Eliza into her OR to observe her teaching technique, Bailey suspended her. Bailey came to her house to get her to come back to her job. She agreed to come back if Richard could return to the Residency Program Director. Bailey declined and Meredith didn't come to work. Richard came over to Meredith's house to get her to come back and said she'd be fine.\n\n\nEventually, Meredith finally agreed to dinner with Nathan, but their plans were postponed when Maggie's mother died and Meredith had to take care of her.<ref>[[Be Still, My Soul]], x</ref> She found herself on an airplane with Nathan, as both were heading to a conference. They ended up hooking up in the airplane bathroom. Both had to tend to patients when the plane hit turbulence. The experience allowed them both to become closer and for Meredith to open up to Nathan about her history. She agreed to stay in a hotel room with Nathan, marking another step in their relationship.<ref>[[In the Air Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs the relationship with Nathan progressed to him sleeping over a lot, Meredith finally found it time for him to meet the kids and invited him to dinner. After doing so, she started to panic a bit, but Amelia pointed out there was nothing or no one standing in her way. However, as she came home after work and told her kids about the upcoming guest, her plans were thwarted when Amelia told her that Megan had been found and was on her way to Seattle. Upon finding out that Nathan didn't know yet, Meredith immediately left to go and tell him. As she arrived at the hospital, she witnessed an explosion from the parking lot.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> Meredith rushed inside and started to help out with evacuating patients due to the spreading fire, all the while looking for Nathan. She also went looking for [[Erin Miller]], a missing girl. While looking for Erin on the OR floor, she found that Nathan had refused to evacuate and was still working on his lobectomy patient. She quickly got gowned and gloved to help him so they'd be out faster. As soon as they could, they left and took the patient to the evac zone outside. He had inhaled some smoke and needed oxygen therapy. Meredith stayed with him and checked his breath sounds. In that quiet moment, she recalled their shared dream of their lost loved one returning to them and finally told him the news about Megan. He broke down and she confronted him, unable to answer his questions about Megan. She could only tell him that Megan would be brought to Madigan Medical Center. He decided to drive up there and could hardly contain his excitement and happiness, something she told him he did not need to apologize for as she understood how he felt. She then told him to get going and watched him drive off.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith talks to Megan before the surgery.]]\nMeredith was at work when Owen and Nathan brought Megan to the hospital. She had a frozen abdomen and Meredith had an idea of how they could reverse her colostomy. While Bailey and Webber advised a conservative approach, but Megan opted for the more radical approach so she could return to her son in Iraq faster. Nathan had doubts about Meredith working on the case given their history, but Meredith assured him she could do it. Megan tried to find out from her who Nathan had been dating, but Meredith didn't answer. [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] also urged her to tell Megan the full story. As she advised Alex to tell Jo that he had found her husband, she realized it was only right Megan also got the full story and went to tell her, only moments before Nathan came in to do so. As she prepped Megan for surgery, she shared that her one great love had died and that she'd do everything to get Megan back to her son, which was Megan's first priority. Meredith nervously scrubbed in for the surgery, which went well right up to the end, when she found out there wasn't enough tissue left to close the wound, angering her.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nShe took her anger out by destroying the attending's lounge and went home, where she was inspired to perform an abdominal wall transplant. She got Teddy on her side and they presented the plan to Megan, who accepted the opportunity to escape her hospital bed and didn't have a problem with Meredith doing the surgery. She had Richard's sub-interns set out to find a donor since UNOS had none available. When she received news they had found one, she went to tell Megan, accidentally interrupting Nathan's proposing to her. Meredith, Teddy, and Jo then performed the surgery without a hitch. Megan recovered well. On her way out, Meredith found Nathan sitting outside on a bench. He told her Megan was still convinced he was in love with Meredith, who was angered and walked off.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\nMeredith did not want to be in another love triangle and believed that Nathan was betraying her by not seizing the miraculous opportunity to be with Megan again. Eventually, with all of Meredith's pushing, Nathan started a new life with Megan in Los Angeles with her son, [[Farouk Shami Hunt|Farouk]].\n\nBecause of her groundbreaking procedure on Megan, Meredith landed the cover of the Journal of Surgical Advancement (JSA) and won a [[Catherine Fox Award]]. She also began a series of ALPPS procedures - a first for any doctor on the West Coast.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref> For Jackson's surgery competition, she submitted a proposal for a mini-liver procedure but was unable to get the patent from her mother's former friend, [[Marie Cerone]], who still held a grudge over her and Ellis' fight. Eventually, Meredith was able to develop the procedure with the help of Jo. She also later broke the hospital's record for the single longest surgery.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith starts treating matchmaker Cece.]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew kissed Meredith while drunk, which he immediately apologized for. While she dismissed at as no big deal, the kiss led to her having sex dreams about the majority of men in her life, such as Andrew, Jackson, and Tom. Soon after, she started treating [[Cece Colvin]], a professional matchmaker, who picked up on Meredith's desire to be kissed, even though Meredith dismissed the observation. She threw her hat in the ring for the recent job opening for interim Chief to have extra work to distract her from her desires. Cece had to be put on dialysis awaiting her kidney transplant. Throughout the set-up, she pointed out that there's no cap on happiness and that love doesn't just come walking through the door. After the surgery, Meredith briefly met [[Atticus Lincoln]] but dismissed him at his attempt to introduce himself. At night in bed, a curious Meredith googled Cece's services but opted against using them.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nWhile the sex dreams continued, Meredith found herself avoiding Cece due to her aggressive matchmaking attempts. Jackson advised her to tell Cece she was married to her work, which she heavily objected to, causing Link to overhear that she wasn't married. In another attempt to find more work, Meredith set out to convince Bailey to allow her to create a surgical innovation fellowship for Jo. Later, she ran into Link and he properly introduced himself. She defended her earlier comment and stated she just meant she had a life outside work. He proposed drinks after work, but she had to assist Maggie in inserting a pacemaker for Cece's heart. During the procedure, Maggie also encouraged her to hire Cece. They later had to inform her that her client, whom she had hit after passing out in her car, had died, Cece opposed being put on the transplant list. Bailey then found Meredith and told her she had stolen Meredith's idea and created the fellowship for Jo under her own leadership. She needed some joy and found that was the way to do it, so she told Meredith to go find joy herself. After finding out she had been passed over as interim Chief, which went to Alex instead, Meredith decided to hire Cece. She admitted to Cece that she was, in fact, married to her work but didn't want to be. Having found a new purpose, Cece accepted her as a client and they started talking.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nAfterward, Meredith got tired of the flood of questions soon and did her best to avoid them. Cece tried to get answers through [[Taryn Helm]], but Meredith only closed herself off even more. She confided in Alex, who told her that after everything she had been through, she had earned the right to close herself off and be selective of whom she wanted to let it. While Meredith found a new way to continue Cece's care, she and Cece agreed to diminish the number of questions and try a new approach as well. She instructed Meredith to go out and buy herself five new outfits and ready herself for something new, which she did.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nCece planned a blind date for Meredith, who briefly came into work beforehand wearing make-up, which was noticed by several men, including Andrew and Link. She met with the guy at a restaurant for lunch having low expectations, but they really hit it off and [[John (Character)|John]] completely understood her dedication to her work. Along the way, they discovered they were actually on the wrong date but decided to keep it going. They left the restaurant and took a stroll. While discussing traveling, John stated that he was happy not having kids that could restrict his travel plans. He even went on to say he hated how desperate single mothers are in the dating scene. Having lost all interest due to his comment, Meredith revealed she had three children of her own and left the date.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andy makes Meredith realize there are positive things to take away from her date.]]\nAt the hospital, she shared her experience with [[Andy Herrera]], who made her see that she now knew there still were great men out there and that she managed to dodge this particular slow-moving bullet because he revealed his opinion on single mothers before the relationship could have dragged on for too long.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nThe blind dates continued. Before a date with [[Daniel (Flowers Grow Out of My Grave)|Daniel]], Meredith was told by Richard that [[Thatcher Grey|her father]] was dying of acute myeloid leukemia. She didn't know what to do about the situation. Link approached her for dinner, but she turned him down as she viewed him as more of an emergency kind of person rather than serious dating potential. In surgery, she and Alex discussed her situation with her father. She opened the door by giving him a piece of her liver, but he never walked through. She wouldn't need to grieve him since he had been a ghost for years. On her date, Meredith rambled on about how it shouldn't be children's job to forgive their parents just because they are their parents. She decided not to reach out since the sole purpose would be making Thatcher feel better, which she didn't think weighed up against the pain it would cause her and her kids. She returned to the hospital, where Link put his number in her phone in case of an emergency. At the same time, Andrew came over to ask Meredith about her date. She said she scared him off. Both Link and Andrew then held the elevator doors for her, causing her to take the stairs. After work, she went to hang at Alex and Jo's with Link, whose hair she cut after he had cut off a piece to comfort a kid facing cancer treatment.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was flown out to Los Angeles with [[Tom Koracick]] by [[Catherine Fox]], who needed their expertise. She revealed she had a spinal tumor. They did extra tests and found it was a grade III chondrosarcoma. Catherine struggled with how to tell Richard. Unbeknownst to her, Meredith received a call from Richard to tell her he had been arrested and was in jail.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Seattle, Meredith bailed out Richard as a windstorm hit Seattle. Back at the hospital, she and Andrew treated a deteriorating Cece, who had discovered Link and suggested him to Meredith. Concerned over Catherine's health, Meredith was dismissive of Maggie's relationship troubles with Jackson. Meredith eventually broke HIPAA and told Maggie about Catherine's cancer. At the same time, Taryn arrived with the news that they had finally found a donor for Cece. Andrew clarified to Cece that there was a very real chance she would not make it off the table alive, but Cece was willing to roll the dice. She did warn Meredith she would come back to haunt her if she didn't do her best to squeeze all possible joy out of her life. This convinced Meredith to say yes to drinks with Link, much to Andrew's dismay. He then sought out Meredith as she was preparing for the transplant and told her that he had fallen in love with her since their kiss and that he wanted her to know that he was an option. While she had some excuses to turn him away, such as her being his attending and his history with Maggie, he thought she felt the attraction between them, too. Overcome by desire, she removed herself from the situation and promised him she'd think about what he had said. Soon after, they got stuck together in an elevator on their way to the OR due to a power outage caused by the storm.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith bond while stuck in an elevator.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith decides not to choose between the two men pursuing her just yet.]]\nWith no cell phone connection, they tried to find a way out to no avail. She asked him to stop looking at her the way he did. He likened their situation to Doctor Who's TARDIS, where the rules don't apply, but she told him the rules still applied. While in there, Andrew confided in her about how his famous surgeon father killed four people while he operated in a manic episode but he got away with it because of his connections. Meredith then decided to try the trap door and he lifted her up but to no avail. As he lowered her down, she dropped into his arms and they almost shared a kiss until the power kicked back in. Finally free, they rushed to the OR. Unfortunately, Cece didn't make it. Meredith closed her up and told her about her interest in both Link and Andrew. Thanks to Cece, she had found happiness again. Afterward, Andrew showed some of his appealing cocky side and asked Meredith out on a date, with Link coming over at the exact moment with the same question. Unable to choose, she decided to go home to her children.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nThe attraction between Meredith and Andrew continued to grow with every surgery did they together. At the same time, she found herself irritated by Link's laid-back attitude. She questioned why Jo ever thought they would be good together and didn't try to hide her disdain from Link. A difference of opinion over a shared patient led to a confrontation in the OR. She wondered why he had kept his reasoning for his non-standard approach from her, to which he replied that convincing her that he belonged here was not a part of his job.\n\nLater, he found out that The Hulk had canceled for [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey's]] superhero birthday party. He offered to help out and they managed to get her house ready in time. He explained he offered to help out because she seemed stressed. He shared he does not believe in letting stress ruin your life after half of his hospital friends died from a cancer he survived and because his parents split up over it. Finally understanding the origins of his laid-back nature, she apologized for the way she behaved. He didn't mind as he liked the chase. The kids then arrived for the party and Link played along with Bailey. They sat down with cake and wine and he complimented her on running a three-kid household all the while winning surgical awards. As she admitted she had grown to like him more over the course of the day, they continued to talk over cake and wine while she ignored Andrew's text asking her to come over to celebrate his first solo surgery.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith reconnects with her dying father.]]\nFollowing Richard's urging, Meredith decided she did want to say goodbye to her father before it was too late. She went to visit him and discovered he had moved to Zimbabwe after Lexie's death. The realization he had yet again left her behind hurt her deeply, but he revealed he had actually come back for Derek's funeral. However, he saw how lost she was and decided not to bother her any further one of the most difficult days of her life. Conversation then came easier and Meredith told him about Maggie and her children and comforted him until he died with her by his side.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Jo and Alex invited Meredith for their classy NYE party. Andrew came over to ask Meredith out for drinks. She declined as she had to go put her kids to bed, but she did invite him to come to the party with her. Link, dressed as Santa, came over to give Meredith cookies from his bag while on his way to the peds ward. Jo mocked Meredith's love triangle, but Meredith stated there was no love and thus no triangle. Afterward, Andrew asked Meredith when she was going to stop stringing Link along as he was growing tired of wasting time not being with her. She assured him NYE was an actual date between them. However, she stayed at the hospital, thus standing up both Link and Andrew at the party.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew confronts Meredith about her behavior.]]\nLater at work, Andrew confronted Meredith over her standing him up and stated it was just rude of her. As time went on, he witnessed her convincing her patient's husband not to give up, he wondered how she could tell the man that if she herself kept running away from love. He thought she was so beyond him, but it turns out she was just a kid hiding behind excuses. To spite him, Meredith turned around and asked Link out to dinner. He was surprised since it was Valentine's Day but gladly accepted. Later that day, Meredith officiated a wedding between her patient and her fianc\ue shortly before the former's death. Afterward, Andrew took Meredith to the hospital roof for a spontaneous date with champagne. She stayed with him and they ended up sharing their first kiss while Link waited for her at the restaurant.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith apologized to Link for standing him up. She also held off on going on a real date with Andrew because she wanted to make sure Maggie was okay with it. While awaiting the date, Andrew kept staring at her longingly so Meredith set a rule that he could not do that at work so at to not be distracted from her work. After successfully operating on [[Kimberly Thompson|a woman from Maggie's past]] together, Maggie was finally ready to hear her out. While surprised, she was fine with it, so Meredith then went to find Andrew and took him out on a date to a restaurant. He agreed but insisted it'd be his treat.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew lets Meredith sleep.]]\nFollowing their date, Andrew assisted her as she broke the hospital's longest surgery record with a  hour and -minute surgery. Afterward, an exhausted Meredith fell asleep on a gurney in a hallway, so Andrew moved her to a bed in an empty room and covered her with a blanket.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith plan to leave soon for a night to themselves.]]\nOn the day of Jackson's party to celebrate Catherine surviving her surgery, Meredith told Chief Karev about her relationship with Andrew. He mocked her and also told her to report it to HR. She took Andrew to the party with her as her plus one, though they did not plan on staying long as Meredith had the house to herself. However, their plans were disrupted when Amelia had a fight with Owen and planned on sleeping at the house. Andrew then took Meredith into a guest room at Jackson's and they started making out there, only to be caught by Richard. To calm herself and \"act normal\", Meredith took Andrew into the kitchen and took over preparing egg rolls from the catering staff, inadvertently putting a plastic tray in the oven, which led to the penthouse being evacuated right before the big celebratory speech. Andrew and Meredith then decided to go to his place, but their plans were once again disrupted, this time by the return of [[Carina DeLuca]] with [[Vincenzo DeLuca]], Andrew's father.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew asks Meredith to trust his judgment on his father.]]\nVincenzo came to Seattle to pitch research on gestational sacks, while Meredith had a dream about her mother that steered her towards finding a specific new research project, though she had yet to figure out what exactly it was. While she spent the day in a lab trying to find an answer, Andrew visited and told her that his father seemed stable despite Carina's claims that he was bipolar. At the same time, Maggie publicly revealed her biological parentage to the medical community, which Meredith was fine with. Meredith talked about Vincenzo with Alex and advised him to dig deeper before agreeing to fund the research, but hid her knowledge about his mental illness so as to not break Andrew's trust. She later came across the arguing DeLuca siblings in a hallway. Carina wanted to shut the research down, but Andrew had signed on, insisting their father was stable. While Meredith herself remained on the fence, Andrew asked her to trust his judgment on this. At the end of the day, Meredith concluded her research had to be about non-invasive diagnostic tools.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew spent all his time on his father's research while Meredith gave him the space to do so. While her bad feeling about the project persisted, she decided to just be supportive of Andrew. In the end, Vincenzo's display of reckless behavior led to Alex shutting the research down. Meredith found Andrew clearing out the lab and he requested some time alone, so she told him to let her know if he needed anything and left him be.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith works on her research while Andrew ignores her.]]\nAndrew continued to shut Meredith out, so she focused her time and energy on her ingestible diagnostic device research. He later sent her a text to come over, which she did. She told him she was past the point in her life where she would sit around at work wondering if her boyfriend was ignoring her. He knew that, but he just needed some time to be hurt over his father and he did not want to drag her down with him. To make up for his behavior, he made her an apology dinner.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith assisted Jackson, Catherine, Owen, and [[Megan Hunt]] on a complex surgery involving an abdominal wall transplant and a penis and scrotum transplant, Richard gave Andrew a solo lap appy under his supervision. Meredith spent the day worrying about Andrew, but he passed Richard's test with flying colors despite the surgery turning into a complicated procedure. Richard told her that Andrew was a good man and Andrew later talked her through his day over dinner at his place.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nThe relationship continued to evolve but Meredith never let him sleep over since she didn't want her kids to meet him before she had told them about him. However, one night, Andrew ran into Zola while sneaking out, thus disrupting Meredith's plan on how to tell her kids. At work, Meredith and Andrew's patient turned out to be in labor instead of having an obstruction. Meredith asked Bailey for advice on how to tell her kids. After watching Andrew take care of the newborn baby, Meredith decided to gather her kids that night. Over ice cream, she told them that Andrew was her boyfriend and that he would be visiting more, but that she was not going anywhere, following Bailey's advice.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith's happy life continued for a short while until she joined Alex and Andrew on [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabriella Rivera's]] case. Gabby and her mother had been detained at the Mexican border. Gabby was reunited with her father after three months while her mother was still in the detention center. Since she was given little to no medical care, Luis had no clue what was going on with her. A scan revealed an obstruction that eventually led to her needing surgery. Unable to pay for it, Luis applied for state coverage but he earned too much cleaning office buildings to qualify. With Gabby's condition worsening, Meredith promised she had a plan. She secretly put her daughter Ellis's name on the paperwork, which alarmed Richard. He yelled at her for what she did, but she insisted that the system was broken and that they could debate her actions later. She then headed into surgery. Pathology revealed that the obstruction was caused by lymphoma, meaning they were looking at years of treatment and follow-up.\n\nAfter the surgery, Richard pointed out that Meredith was risking losing her license and a prison sentence for committing a felony and that implicating Luis in insurance fraud wouldn't help his asylum. He then suggested that they make Gabby sicker on paper so they could keep her in the hospital for  days, after which a new state policy would automatically kick in regardless of Luis' income. They rolled with it and assured Luis he could sleep in Gabby's room every night so they would not have to be separated again. Meredith assumed that Andrew was judging her for her actions, but he revealed he was actually in awe of her and hadn't spoken out because he was afraid he would tell her that he loved her. Taken by surprise, Meredith barely responded to his confession and left.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nUpon finding out that Jo still hadn't spoken to Alex after her return from Pittsburgh, Meredith went to stay with Jo while Alex took her place in her household. Jo shut her out and said Meredith was only there to hide from her own life. Meredith admitted that Andrew's \"I love you\" terrified her because it reminded her of Derek and all the pain she had been through. She then said she understood pain from deep experience and that her parents had messed with her head, like Alex's had, so they would both understand whatever had happened in Pittsburgh. Jo then revealed that her mother was raped by her father and that she looked like him. Jo then opened up about how all the terrible things in her life were just her birthright, but Meredith quipped with good things that Jo had been a part of. To get through to her, Meredith talked about how she stopped fighting when she was about to drown and asked if Jo wanted to stop fighting, too, or if she just needed a few more days under her covers. Jo replied the latter, after which Meredith insisted they go talk to Alex and Bailey to get her a proper leave of absence so she could get the help she needed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Trapped, Meredith fails to stop Andrew from taking the fall for her.]]\nWhile Jo waited to talk to Bailey, she asked Meredith to go and tell Alex. Meredith joined him in the hyperbaric chamber with [[Gus Carter]], while unbeknownst to her, her insurance fraud had come to light and Andrew was being questioned by Bailey, Catherine, and representatives from the insurance company. Soon after, Andrew came by with Catherine to say goodbye; he claimed that he had committed the fraud and apologized to her. Meredith wanted to stop him from taking the fall, but she couldn't stop him from taking the fall and turning himself in as she could not leave the chamber.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nUnwilling to explain the whole situation to the technicians through the phone to stop Andrew, Meredith had no choice but to focus on Gus and Alex. She told him about Jo's depression and what had caused it. After finding out about what Andrew did, Richard dropped by. Meredith asked him to set the record straight as Andrew's career would not survive this. He pointed out her children wouldn't recover if she were locked up, but she planned on hiring a great lawyer and plead her case, confident that her track record and the fact that it was her first offense would help her win. As Gus coded, the decompression process was started. She and Alex pulled Gus through and she rushed off.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith informs Bailey and Catherine on what she did.]]\nShe went to set the record straight with Bailey and Catherine. Alex and Richard came to her defense, but Bailey fired all three of them. Having made her mind up, Meredith went home to tell her kids that she would have to leave for a while to go take care of something. She then went to visit Andrew in jail and told him he needed to let her clean up her own messes and develop some self-preservation skills. She stood by her decision. She told him she loved him and left to set the record straight.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nShe immediately went to her attorney. Much to her surprise, she was told that she could go home. The lawyer would schedule a hearing, where she suspected Meredith would be ordered to a few hours of community service in a clinic if she was repentant. Additionally, she deemed it highly unlikely that the medical board would pursue action her license. A week later, the hearing took place and Meredith explained to the judge that Gabriela's cancer meant too many procedures and money to pay for herself or cover it pro bono. She stated the system should have supported the Riveras and that it was broken. She honestly said she only regretted her decisions to the extent she could knowing that they led to Gabriela doing well now. The judge got angry and the lawyer blurted out her three kids as a reason to keep her out of jail. She was then ordered to community service but picking up trash on the streets instead of at a clinic.\n\nWhile picking up trash, she started to give out medical advice when other people in her group found out she was a doctor. After a few weeks, Suzie Wilson, Zola's classroom mom, passed by and recognized her. Thinking she was volunteering, Suzie said she finally understood why Meredith never volunteered at school. Meredith explained working mothers don't have time for that, after which her supervisor shouted at her, revealing that she was actually there per court order. Suzie spread the word at school, which was overheard by Zola, who come home to ask her how to spell criminal. While enjoying some ice cream with Andrew, Meredith told him she was happy both she and the kids were healthy and that she actually found some sense of accomplishment in picking up trash. She then received a letter from the medical board to inform her they were, in fact, pursuing action against her license.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShe started disguising herself better to avoid getting recognized again. One morning, she found out her hearing about her license was scheduled three months later. Taking advantage of still having her license, she continued to give out medical advice to people on her crew, referring them to Pac-North for further care. She also had Levi bring her supplies from Grey Sloan, which she thought of as hers since she still owned the hospital. Her supervisor [[Robin (Season )|Robin]] started to object to her street clinic since it was keeping people from doing their work but Meredith brought up she had noticed a nodule in Robin's neck that warranted a closer look. Robin had seen her primary care physician about it, who referred her to an ENT, but her appointment was still months away. After convincing her that detecting possible cancer was more important than staying at work for two more hours, Meredith took her to the Grey Sloan parking lot for an ultrasound. Given the features shown on there, she convinced Jackson to take the time to perform a biopsy, which revealed papillary thyroid cancer, which could be treated. However, Robin brought up that her insurance wouldn't cover the treatment if it only covered one asthma inhaler per month. Jackson said they would look into options for her, which Robin said would boil down to bankruptcy or death. Meredith was then discovered in the hospital by Bailey but she stated she was just visiting a friend. That night at home, Meredith shared that continuously seeing people being let down by the medical system had made her decide to write about what she was seeing despite her lawyer advising her to lay low.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nShe got in touch with a website that would publish her story and shared some titles she had thought of with Andrew, all of them insulting to the medical system. She didn't care about her standing with the medical community since they were in a fight already anyway. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Meredith's patient [[Shirley Gregory]] was refusing to let Jo operate on her despite her being a student of Meredith's. Jo then had Bailey agree to have Meredith supervise the procedure remotely through video chat, which convinced Shirley to consent. Meredith used Robin owing her to follow the entire procedure through but Bailey hung up on her as soon as the procedure was over, leaving Meredith to go take care of a beehive in a discarded toilet. Link and Amelia came over to hang out with her and Andrew at the house. Amelia shared she was pregnant. Meredith congratulated her, excited about becoming an aunt.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWithout her knowledge, the website combined all her suggested topics into one article entitled \"Hospital Hell at Grey Sloan Memorial: Fired Surgeon Speaks Out.\" Including sharp comments about insurance companies, Big Pharma, and institutionalized discrimination, the article started trending online. She realized the article would terrify people and keep patients away from Grey Sloan. She also figured Bailey would hate her even more, which Andrew confirmed as soon as he got to work. Meredith attempted to set the record straight with the website but they refused to delete the article or even change the headline because of the popularity it had gained. Meredith quickly finished her assigned zone at community service and asked her [[Supervisor Lisa|supervisor]] to be allowed to leave to take care of an emergency. Her supervisor told her that she would inform the judge of all her extracurriculars if she left before putting in the required hours. After Meredith learned even Cristina had learned about the article, she promised Lisa she would make up the hours and begged her not to call the judge, after which she took off. At the hospital, after Jo confirmed that Bailey was furious at her, Meredith went to see her and told her that she had nothing to do with the article as all the things she had written herself were not directed at the hospital. She offered to write a retraction but Bailey said they never get read. Meredith stressed she loved the hospital and how sorry she was but Bailey said the damage had been done and asked her to leave.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith defends her choices to Andrew.]]\nOn her way out, she ran into Andrew and told him what had gone down and that she had gotten a summons to go back to court because she had walked out on community service. Andrew hated that she made a choice that could land her in jail and added to the possibility of her losing her license. He wished she would have done the community service and come back to work to change the system from within, but she said nothing she had written was untrue and that she wasn't going to sit on her mountain of privilege leaving others to fight for themselves in the broken system that was hurting and killing them. She added that if he really expected her to sit back and nothing, he didn't know her at all, and walked away from him.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nHer skipping out on community service gave her nightmares. On the day of her court hearing, she woke up to Zola telling her she wasn't feeling well. When Zola vomited during breakfast, a worried Meredith took her to the hospital and asked Tom for a head CT given Zola's history of spina bifida. While waiting for the CT, her lawyer reminded her she needed to be in court but the scans revealed Zola's shunt needed to be revised. Andrew tried to convince her to go to court while he'd look out for Zola but Meredith made it clear there was no way she would leave her daughter. Tom made Meredith wait in the waiting area so she made Taryn promise to text her updates. Andrew offered to sit with her but she didn't like him offering to skip a surgery to be her human tissue. Maggie and Amelia came to sit with her and Meredith vented her frustration about Andrew, who just didn't get her because he wasn't a parent himself. She said Andrew was sexy and fun but she wasn't sure if he was more than that or if she even wanted him to be. She then asked Maggie and Amelia to talk about their lives to distract her. Meredith grew increasingly worried despite Taryn's reassuring texts. As she was about to head to the OR, Zola's surgical team came by to tell everything had gone fine. Meredith ordered Andrew to stay by Zola's side in post-op. Later that night, Meredith headed out to get Zola some Jello. She ran into Andrew, who had anticipated the request and had found her a cup. Her lawyer then appeared and Meredith explained why she hadn't shown up for the hearing. Nancy told her she squeezed a drop of humanity out of the judge, which meant she'd have to make up the lost hours in jail.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith went to jail. On Halloween, she woke up with her roommate [[Paula (Season )|Paula]] hovering over her face because Meredith had been snoring. Since she was supposed to be let out that day and was eager to spend the holiday with her kids, Meredith watched the clock closely. When the time came, she addressed a guard, who told her that, as per usual, a crucial document for her release hadn't arrived one time but that it would show up soon. Meredith tried to bribe the guard by offering medical advice to any sick family members but it didn't work. Paula then learned she was a doctor and wondered what she did to end up in jail. Meredith told her about her crime, which was still threatening her medical license. Paula wasn't impressed with her small problems and told her how she had landed there. She was still waiting for her hearing but couldn't post bail so she was stuck in jail until the hearing, which would most likely be another month. Meanwhile, her kids were placed in the foster system. Meredith helped her out with a puzzle and commented that she was strong for not letting herself go crazy with worry over her kids. The guard came to let Meredith out and they wished each other good luck. The officer told Meredith to keep fighting the good fight without landing herself in jail. Meredith then asked the man for a favor. She went home and greeted her kids. She told her sisters she had come to realize she had a lot to work with even if she were to lose her license. She then called her lawyer and made arrangements to pay Paula's bail so she could be reunited with her kids.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nHaving made up for the hours, Meredith went back to doing community service. She ran into Amelia on her way out one day and advised her to tell Owen about the pregnancy. Meredith was working near Pac-North and decided to have coffee with Alex during her break. While in line at the coffee cart, she ran into Amelia and Maggie who told her about their problems.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of her hearing, Meredith drove to the hotel with her sisters, Alex, and Andrew. While waiting to enter the room of the hearing, Meredith waited with most of Grey Sloan's attendings, including Bailey. Upon entering the room, Nancy asked Meredith to keep quiet for once given the vicious prosecutor and let her do her job. Meredith promised she would.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith learns Paul Castello is on the panel.]]\nThe hearing began and the judge introduced the doctors on the panel. [[Paul Castello]] came in late and Meredith immediately recognized him as the doctor who had killed Derek, while he didn't seem to remember her at all. Meredith quietly explained the situation to Nancy but upon learning that the hearing would have to be rescheduled, which could take six months, Meredith decided to power through with Paul on the panel. Bailey took the stand first and denied Nancy's suggestions of her and Meredith being close. She stated Meredith no longer held the qualities that had prompted Bailey to appoint her Head of General Surgery. Afterward, the prosecutor presented her with a list of questionable events Meredith had been involved in, all of which Bailey confirmed to be true. Afterward, Luis Rivera testified that Meredith had saved his daughter and that there should be more doctors like her. Andrew was mostly questioned about their relationship, which he assured them was completely consensual and that Meredith had not pressured him to keep the fraud quiet when he discovered it. He was also confronted with his request for a transfer, which detailed Meredith's and other attendings' abuse of him after he pressed charges against Alex for assaulting him. Andrew assured the panel that that had been cleared up and left in the past. He apologized to Meredith, who said it was okay. Levi began testifying about Meredith being an amazing teacher but he was soon forced to confess that he had been the one who had reported the fraud to Bailey. He broke down and ran out after his testimony. During the recess that followed, Meredith told Andrew that their relationship wouldn't survive if her license were taken away.\n\nAfter the recess, Owen testified to her surgical skills, specifically on Megan's case, but the prosecutor had dug up Bailey's post-op notes, which mentioned Owen voicing serious doubts about Meredith's approach at the time. Richard was questioned about the Alzheimer trial but he maintained that he was the only one who had played a role in that. The prosecutor commented on the pattern of his bending the rules for Meredith and called [[Patricia Murphy]] to the stand. She shared that Meredith hadn't been matched to Seattle Grace at first until Richard reached out to the NRMP to make a personal recommendation, which landed Meredith her spot. Meredith was shocked upon hearing this. Alex testified about Meredith making him a better person and surgeon. He was asked about the delay in Zola's adoption. He kept her kidnapping of Zola quiet and said delays happen all the time. The prosecutor suspected it had something to do with Meredith's being fired. Alex hesitated to answer. Paul then began pressing him to answer, asking if Meredith's insubordinate behavior had almost cost her her daughter. Meredith shot up and told him that he had no right to talk about her daughter as he had been the one to kill her father as he neglected to do even basic burr holes, let alone a head CT. Meredith yelled that he didn't deserve to judge her or anyone for that matter, after which he had a sudden seizure. She was among the doctors who rushed to his aid. She briefed the paramedics when they arrived and stressed that they should get him a head CT. \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Gabby is among the patients who showed up to show their support for Meredith.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey re-hires Meredith to work at Grey Sloan.]]\nAfter another recess, the judge announced that the hearing would be postponed given the situation. Alex, however, objected and let in a large group of people, all of whom had been treated by Meredith. [[Ray Ford]], [[Shirley Gregory]], [[Robin (Season )|Robin]], and [[Katie Bryce]] all testified that Meredith had saved their lives. Alex then read a letter from Cristina, which stated that taking Meredith's license meant signing death certificates of countless future patients and that Meredith was an unstoppable light in a broken system. Alex wanted to proceed with letters from Callie, Arizona, April, and even Addison, but the judge had heard enough. He asked to clear the room but Bailey had something more to say. She stated Meredith had in fact broken the law to save a life, so she deserved to pick up trash, but she did not deserve to have her license taken over it. Bailey stated Meredith was too good of a surgeon for that and that everything she had survived made her better instead of cold or hard. Everyone then had to clear the room. Meredith waited outside until Nancy came to deliver the news that the majority of the panel had voted to drop the entire thing, meaning she got to keep her license. Meredith briefly hugged Andrew and was then flooded with hugs from her other friends. As they all left the hotel, Bailey told Meredith she could return to work at Grey Sloan. Meredith accepted the offer and hugged her.\n\nAt home, she ran into Jackson as Maggie was throwing him out. Shortly after, Andrew arrived. He wanted to talk. She apologized for what she had said about their relationship. He knew she had meant it. He pointed out everything he had done for her with the whole insurance fraud situation, which he said was what you do for your partner. However, he had come to realize that unlike him, she did not truly see him as her partner. While she was talking about Derek in that hearing, he realized that she didn't respect him like she did Derek. Meredith told him she respected him, too, but he insisted some part of her was wondering if he would ever be her equal. He told her to take some time to think about her future and if she wanted him to be a part of that.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn her first day back, Meredith snuck into work to do two lap appies before breakfast to ease back in. Cristina also had sent her a package to congratulate her but it was nowhere to be found. The resident presented her with a welcome back cake. Andrew didn't know she was coming back. She said she had wanted to tell him but he was too busy dumping her. He said he hadn't dumped her but it was all the same to her. While rounding on [[Jamie Caldwell]], [[Cormac Hayes|Dr. Cormac Hayes]] abruptly interrupted and introduced himself as the new head of peds. He sidelined Meredith and had Andrew present the case again. Scans revealed a mass. Cormac suspected a tumor but Meredith suggested it may be leftover gallstones from the gallbladder removal she had performed a few years back. She didn't want to worry Jamie and her mother about cancer until a biopsy had confirmed it. Cormac went behind her back and told them anyway. Meredith stepped in and assured them nothing was certain yet. During surgery, the biopsy results came in, revealing the mass was not malignant. She went to take it out. Cormac objected but Meredith shut him down by saying he was a guest in her house. It turned out Meredith had been right with her guess.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith learns that Cristina sent her Cormac as a present.]]\nIn post-op, Jamie didn't care about the successful surgery as her crush still hadn't texted her back. Cormac stepped in and said that raising boys himself had taught him that boys are just terrified of talking to girls, so it didn't mean that he wasn't interested in her at all. While leaving work, Meredith ended up on an elevator with Cormac and asked him if it was his thing to scare people at first and then bask in the relief with them later. He told her he just preferred to give people all the information and let them figure out what to do with it, a courtesy that his wife's doctors hadn't shown him before she did. He told her they would have to learn how to live together in her house. As he stepped off, Cristina finally informed Meredith her package wasn't a thing but a person: Cormac, whom she had nicknamed McWidow. Meredith then stared after him, not noticing Andrew who had been planning to set the record straight.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith went to complain about Cormac to Alex and Jo, only to find that Alex was in Iowa and that Jo had brought home a baby from her Safe Haven volunteer work. Link pointed out Jo had kidnapped a baby but Meredith understood why she had taken the baby for the night. They barely had time to catch up before the three of them were paged to the hospital for multiple traumas after a car crashed into Joe's bar. Meredith called in Owen and Richard to help out. After checking that Andrew was okay, Meredith began treating [[Taryn Helm]]. While she implanted an IVC filter, an inebriated Taryn confessed that she was in love with Meredith. Meredith didn't really react to save her from further embarrassment. She wanted to return to the ER with Levi, who collapses. Meredith did a full workup and diagnosed cardiomyopathy. She paged Teddy, who did an angio while Meredith sat by his head. Meredith assured Levi that she had forgiven him for reporting the insurance fraud. Afterward, Meredith briefly talked with Cormac. Jo saw them and commented she could see something between them. Richard then asked her to come. He told her Bailey had had a miscarriage and needed some comforting. They got a box of doughnuts and sat down with her in her office so she wouldn't feel lonely.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith texted Cristina to get more info on Cormac but Cristina stayed mum. Cormac came into the lounge to get coffee and after he was gone, Amelia commented on his being hot. Meredith then went to find Andrew and told him that she didn't like his telling her to take time to think. He told her about his patient who was inexplicably having fevers three days after a routine appendectomy. Meredith said she'd think on it but advised him to also tell Bailey. Before leaving, she told him she was missing him. He reminded her that he hadn't dumped her so she didn't have to miss him. En route to the ER, Meredith asked Cormac about Cristina, though he didn't realize whom she was talking about. While waiting on the scans of their shared patients, he asked her not to hold their first meeting against him as it was around the time he had lost his wife two years earlier. She understood and assured him it would get better over time, though not all the way better. They disagreed over approaches and had to convert to his when hers failed. He didn't hold it against her as he had had the same disagreement with Cristina once, though he was on Meredith's side back then. He then realized Meredith had brought up Cristina earlier but she made an excuse and left without divulging any further information about their connection. She went to Andrew, who still hadn't figured out what was wrong with his patient, and asked him to talk her through the entire case.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThat led them to reconcile to some degree. They spent the night together. In the morning, he received word that his patient [[Suzanne Britland]] was being moved to the CCU. While getting dressed, he said they should talk about their relationship soon and revealed he had lured diagnostician [[Lauren Riley]] from UCSF to the hospital using Meredith's name before rushing out. At work, Meredith encountered Cormac as he was giving his boys a tour of the hospital. She ran into Amelia, who had seen Andrew leave the house and wondered if they were back together. Meredith said it was just sex at this point. Later, Lauren approached her, and Meredith wrongly addressed her as the consult from UCLA, making Lauren realize that Andrew had lied. On her way to consult on Levi's patient, she ran into Cormac, whose boys had ditched him in an attempt to make them late for the parent-teacher conferences. He was in awe of her staying sane while combining her job and raising her three kids, though she admitted to dropping some balls here and there. Meredith had to tell Levi's patient that her cancer had metastasized beyond the point of treatment. She came to see how Levi set up a dance floor in the cafeteria for the patient and her husband, which made her reflect on how she used to be the kind of person who did romantic things like that. Now, she broke up with Andrew after her trial and just woke up happy to get to practice medicine the next day without giving the break-up much thought. Bailey told her that it was part of growing up. Jackson then came in to inform them that Richard was refusing to work at Grey Sloan on Catherine's terms. The three of them threatened to quit if Tom didn't rehire Richard and Owen on their terms. Tom complied.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and Carina share their concerns over Andrew's mental health.]]\nMeredith started to put together a pro bono surgery day. As she was recruiting Cormac to operate, Andrew interrupted the conversation to inquire about a past patient of hers who had developed a post-op rash similar to Suzanne's, whom they had taken off all her meds so more indicative symptoms could manifest. Meredith talked him through the case and noticed that he was speaking fast and apparently had not slept for days. She confronted Lauren's about her treating Andrew like a machine but Lauren pointed out she was counting on it, with Suzanne's life hanging in the balance. Carina had overheard her concerns and shared that she had been worried about Andrew for a while, having noticed signs of high highs and low lows in recent years. Meredith was on the fence if his dedication was mania or healthy obsession but Carina pointed out she wouldn't ask that question about a resident she didn't love. Meredith then took her concerns to Bailey, who put Meredith on Suzanne's case to approve every step.\n\nOut of nowhere, as Meredith was checking on Suzanne, Andrew and Lauren rushed in with the diagnosis of Still's disease and Andrew injected her with high-dose steroids without any explanation. Meredith pointed out he could have taken a minute to explain his actions before administrating steroids, which could kill her if they were wrong about the diagnosis. Fortunately, they were right and Suzanne quickly recovered. Meredith sought out Andrew to inform him about her status but he lashed out. She said that move could have ended his career had it gone wrong and she pointed out he was not in the right state of mind to make life-and-death decisions. He blamed her for being a hypocrite. Cormac tried to intervene but Meredith had it covered. Andrew went on praising himself for saving Suzanne's life against all odds, which led Meredith to point out he was sounding like his father. She suggested he get some sleep, but he said he didn't need any of this nor her. He told her they were done and left. Cormac suggested the write him up but Meredith declined. She sat down to text Alex, who started typing up a reply but stopped, which worried her.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAlex continued to dodge her even though she knew he was not in Iowa. As a blizzard hit Seattle and blocked off all roads, Cormac was unable to get a donor liver from Seattle Pres to Grey Sloan. Andrew overheard and offered to go get it himself, being used to the cold due to growing up in Wisconsin. Meredith tried to talk him out of it but he brushed off her concerns and took off. While he was off, Meredith and Cormac worked to stabilize the girl, who developed a hemorrhage. As they waited, she told him about how she got fired and he talked about him and Cristina treating a kid with a similar condition in Switzerland, bringing up a story Cristina had told him about Alex saving a kid with that condition as well. He said Cristina talked about Alex a lot but Meredith was surprised to hear she had never mentioned her to Cormac.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith gets to know Cormac as they wait for the liver.]]\nAn hour after they got word Andrew had left Seattle Pres with the liver, Meredith got anxious. Cormac told her about moving to Switzerland after his wife's death, which she likened to her fleeing to San Diego. They talked about lives without their spouses and agreed the firsts without them are especially tough. Andrew then came in with the liver and frostbitten fingers, as he had forgotten to wear gloves. Meredith and Cormac saved the girl. She went to inform Andrew, whose fingers had been treated by Jackson. Together with Carina, she again voiced her concerns over his mental state but he ordered her to leave the room. She and Cormac left the hospital to go spoil their kids. He asked her who Andrew was to her. She replied he was a first, the first man she told \"I love you\" to after Derek. He told her it was nice to meet someone widowed young like him. She agreed. As she walked off, Cormac told her Cristina mentioned her \"twisted sister\" a lot, whom he now suspected was Meredith. She just shrugged and walked off.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOn her day off, she received a letter from Alex. He wrote that he had left Seattle, admitting he had chosen the easy way out as he didn't want her to give him crap for his decision to set him straight. He revealed he was with Izzie and explained that he reached out to get a letter of support for Meredith's trial, which finally gave him a good excuse to reach out to her. He wrote that during his call with Izzie, he heard children in the background, and Izzie told him they were his. She had used the frozen embryos, which he had given her permission to do way back when. He had secretly taken off to meet his twins right after the trial. He went on to describe his kids and his life with Izzie and said he needed to be a father to his kids, which Meredith had taught him how to be through being a mother to her kids. He wrote that he'd miss the hell out of her but assured her that she was perfectly capable of being her own person with him and Cristina gone. He also asked her not to show up to his house to talk him into returning to Seattle because, for the first time in his life, he felt that he was exactly where he needed to be. He concluded by saying she was always welcome to visit once she had accepted his decision so that his kids could meet their Auntie Mer, adding that he hoped she wouldn't hate him too much. Meredith was emotional but decided to respect his wish. Later, she explained to Zola that Uncle Alex had left.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Amelia inquired about Alex's departure but Meredith said she didn't want to talk about it. She and Levi treated Noelle, a woman who had had an accident working jobs through an app that she needed to make ends meet. The patient revealed she had been rationing her insulin. At that moment, Meredith was paged by Tom and found that he had cleared an entire floor for [[Griffin Ford]], a VIP billionaire patient, which explained the problem with admissions that Noelle had had. Tom had her examine Griffin, who came to the hospital looking for a medical reason as to why he had made a grave error that had caused a rocket to explode above Seattle. She reluctantly did the exam but took off as soon as Noelle's CT results got back, leaving Griffin in Jackson's care. Noelle coded and went into DIC. They were unable to save her. She ran into Tom, who asked her what she would do with Griffin's money. She had a whole list ready on how to improve the world. He then asked her how she decided which rules to break. She told him she just followed her gut to make the world better. At the end of the day, Meredith reflected on the inequity she had witnessed and told Bailey she missed Alex to cheer her up. She finally told someone she wasn't sure she could do this on her own. Bailey recognized the feeling, being the last one standing from her residency class, and then told Meredith that Richard was stepping down from surgery.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith meets her pro bono patients.]]\nOn her pro bono surgery day, she had  surgeries to divide among four surgeons, all before Tom would shut down the project at  PM. She tried to recruit Richard but he still refused to operate. Patients and their family members grew upset as Meredith had to solve multiple issues, like Andrew going behind her back and messing up her OR schedule to get a patient into an OR and away from her supposed aunt as he suspected the patient was a human trafficking victim. She ended up asking Tom for more time. He complied and spontaneously agreed to pay for the overtime, explaining that Griffin Ford paid them a lot of money. She pieced together that Tom had made a fake diagnosis to fit Griffin's agenda in exchange for a large amount of money, which Tom was planning on using to fix the world like she had advised him too. Suddenly, a code violet was called and she found Andrew making a scene in the OR waiting room, where he tried to keep his patient's aunt away from her niece. As he was yelling accusations, Meredith and other attendings formed a human circle around him, indicating he was the dangerous person rather than the aunt and convinced him to go to Bailey's office.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith convinces Andrew not to quit.]]\nShe later found out he had quit as he felt people were obstructing him in accomplishing the impossible and changing lives. She told him she loved him and begged him not to quit and instead take the suspension Bailey had proposed so that he wouldn't ruin his career. He agreed to that only if Meredith called the national trafficking hotline, which she agreed to. Later, Amelia came to ask for a spot for her veteran patient and when Meredith agreed, an uproar ensued among the other scheduled patients, who feared they'd be sent home without their promised surgery. Meredith then decided that everyone would get their surgery and that the hospital would host a monthly pro bono surgery day from here on out, for which she credited their generous donor. They managed to perform all the surgeries. Bailey later informed her that the aunt and her niece had disappeared, making them fear that Andrew had been right. Cormac complimented her on her work today but she was too concerned about the human trafficking situation to accept the praise. He then said he could finally see the twisted-ness Cristina had been talking about.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith was supposed to accompany Richard to Los Angeles for his speech on his PathPen at the Surgical Innovation Conference but she had to stay home as her sitter got the flu. Zola set up a live feed for them to watch his talk, which went disastrously as he dismissed his Pen and started rambling nonsense about having found a cure for cancer. A worried Meredith watched in horror as Maggie and Cormac dragged Richard off the stage and called for an ambulance.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith and Bailey set up a war room at the hospital and gathered the attendings to figure out what was going on with Richard. Unlike the others, Meredith was convinced it was not Alzheimer's. Together with Maggie, she ran some cognitive tests, which he failed miserably. When Richard disappeared from his room, she found him hallucinating in an OR, about to slice open his abdomen. She told him she could fix him as he was the one who taught her everything about surgery, life, and being a parent. She said she wasn't ready to lose him yet. Her talk brought him back to reality and he handed over the scalpel. As he slowly realized something was wrong with him, he addressed her as Ellis. She took him back to his room. Still convinced it was something other than rapidly progressing Alzheimer's, she sought out Andrew, who secretly had been working on the case, and had him show her what he had come up with so far. She told him they wouldn't leave until they figured it out and got to work.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nThe two of them spent days at the hospital trying to find the diagnosis with other doctors coming and going to help out. After a week of Meredith ignoring her home life, Maggie reminded her of how she herself had pushed her mother while refusing to accept the reality of her impending death. She thought Meredith was doing the same to Richard, refusing to believe it was Alzheimer's. Since Tom and Amelia agreed it was Alzheimer's, Catherine decided to take him home. Meredith found Andrew disrespectfully yelling at Catherine for her decision. She sent him for a walk and apologized for his behavior. Meredith then joined Catherine, Maggie, and Bailey to go discharge Richard, who brought up that his feet and hands were numb. Meredith then convinced Catherine to let her run an EMG, which showed impaired function. Tom and Amelia then changed their opinion and agreed to a nerve biopsy. Right before the procedure, Andrew barged in and knocked over the tray with instruments to stop them from performing the biopsy. He said Richard had received a hip replacement with cobalt, which could be deteriorating and leaking into his blood. Meredith drew blood for a test, which came back positive. She advocated with Bailey to let Andrew scrub in to watch up close despite his inappropriate behavior before, though Bailey stressed that he was on the thin ice. Link successfully removed the hip, which would solve the problems.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith finds a broken down Andrew.]]\nAfter work, Cormac complimented Meredith on her diagnosis and asked her for a drink. She asked for a rain check and walked off. She then found a broken down Andrew sitting at the nurses' station. He had completely fallen apart. She pulled him up and took him home.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nShe didn't feel comfortable leaving him at home by himself so she took him back to work with her the next day, leaving him to rest in an on-call room. She informed Carina, who hated that she and Bailey had pushed him to this point in spite of her warnings about his condition. However, they yet again had to push him past his limits when [[Erin Banks]], the human trafficking victim, showed up at the hospital again asking for him specifically. They had Andrew accompany her during the pre-op exams. Meredith and Bailey operated on her and they discussed Andrew during the surgery. As Bailey remembered her own struggle to accept her mental illness, Meredith advocated for Bailey not to give up on Andrew either. They staged an intervention with Carina, Richard, and [[Cynthia Cole|his psychiatrist]]. Meredith told him that caring so much and fighting as hard for his patients as he did was a strength. He broke down as he had failed to attain the most important goal in his life, which was not to end up like his father. Meredith convinced him to fight as hard for himself as he had done for his patients, at which point he accepted to get treatment for his bipolar disorder. Afterward, Meredith and Bailey walked [[Abby Banks]] to the ICU to be reunited with her long-lost sister.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> At some point during the day, she also met her [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|new nephew]] and left the new parents to fight about the baby's name.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs COVID- first hit the United States, Seattle was amongst the country's cities to be hit the hardest, forcing Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to quickly adapt to the new reality. With all non-emergent surgeries cancelled, Meredith was one of the doctors doing shifts in the special COVID- ICU, where she had to run codes all the time and where most of her patients kept dying suddenly and unexpectedly. Since visitors were no longer routinely allowed, she had to witness how these patients died without their loved ones, who had to be informed either by a phone call or by another doctor who was assigned to the visitors' tent outside. She developed a habit of reciting surgical steps in her head to deal with her claustrophobia in the PPE. While working shifts, she also tried to contact Andrew, who had disappeared without a word. With yet another death imminent, she called the patient's daughter to rush to the hospital to be able to say goodbye. Her frustration finally hit a boiling point and she destroyed a supply room. She was surprised when Andrew arrived, now an attending. He informed her he was doing well and had spent his time asleep at home to keep the mania from creeping back in. While she was glad he was doing okay, she told him to inform people on his whereabouts.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nOn one of her breaks, she went outside to catch some fresh air. She ran into Cormac and Jackson, whom she was jealous of for having operated earlier that day. Having overheard her talk with Jackson, Cormac paged her to scrub in with him when [[Frankie Morris]] was admitted with a tree branch perforating his recently transplanted kidney. She was delighted to get to do what she is best at again. While operating, Cormac inquired about her kids. She hadn't seen them in two weeks since she was quarantining away from home. Cormac hoped his boys wouldn't go out and break the rules like Frankie had done, though Meredith understood Frankie, remembering how she was as a teenager. They successfully removed the injured pole of the kidney and had Frankie admitted to the ICU. An exhausted Meredith then returned to the COVID ICU. She received a text from Cormac inviting her for a whiskey in his office, but didn't see the text because she had fallen asleep. She woke up when Andrew showed up to take over from her. She put up some resistance, stating she could keep going after the high of the surgery, but Andrew reminded her that a certain friend had once stressed the importance of getting rest. She asked if she was his friend now. He said that she had saved him, so she could be whatever she wanted to be to him. She then agreed to let him take over. However, she collapsed in the parking lot, where Cormac found her unconscious. Meredith herself was dreaming of a [[Meredith's Beach|beach]], which she had dreamt about before while taking short naps in the COVID ICU. However, this time, she was greeted by Derek from a distance.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nShe was rushed inside and a COVID test came back positive. She was admitted to a regular room on a COVID ward, where she used her connections to get her a tablet to be able to stay on top of the situation at the hospital. After four days, Meredith found that the hospital was nearly at capacity for COVID patients so she requested to be allowed to go quarantine in a hotel as she felt fit enough. However, as Teddy and Andrew were debating her request, she passed out again, yet again finding herself at the beach with Derek. She tried to reach him but woke up as Andrew and Maggie got her back into bed and rushed her to radiology for a chest CT. After the scan showed a dire situation, Meredith suggested they start her on triple antiviral therapy on which she had found an article. Meredith once again awoke from a beach dream when Amelia video chatted with little Ellis. Maggie tried to talk to her about her healthcare directive but Meredith brushed it off so she could talk to her daughter. Back on the beach, she tried to reach Derek but somehow always ended up back at the starting point far away from him. He yelled that she was worried about the kids and that the sand wasn't real. She yelled back that she missed him, which he knew. Bailey later came in to talk about the healthcare directive, pointing out that Alex would have to make rough decisions over the phone if things went south. Meredith insisted Alex would know when to pull the plug and asked Bailey to distract her instead. Later, she explained to Cormac that it was tough to pick a new POA as everyone was like family to her. He advised her to write down exactly what she wanted and then pick someone who would defend her choices, like his late wife had chosen her sister instead of him. Meredith then admitted she was scared she wouldn't wake up if she were to fall asleep, though Cormac was confident she was tough enough to beat the virus. Meredith ended up picking Richard as her POA. She explained she didn't want a ventilator as there was a shortage. Richard pointed out that she might end up as one of the people needing it and stressed that everyone at the hospital needed her. Meredith once again fell asleep as labs showed a worsening condition. She tried to reach Derek again, making a run for it, but she tripped and fell. From a distance, Derek laughed and told her he would be right there for her when she was ready.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith sees George.]]\nWhile sound asleep, Meredith found herself on her beach again, this time with [[George O'Malley]] present. She was delighted to see him and he backed Derek's statement that the sand wasn't real, nor was the ocean or his body. She commented on his looking older than when he had died, which he attributed to her imagining him that way being more comfortable for her. He revealed he had checked in on her and her kids sometimes. She asked if she could decide to go back to the world of the living but he didn't know. He said if he had had the choice, he would have chosen to stay. As they walked, they discussed how his death had devastated her and how she managed to move on from his and even Derek's death. He stated that, unlike her, his mother had become stuck in the grief over his death. In reality, Meredith's condition progressively worsened and as her power of attorney, Richard was tasked with the decision about whether or not to admit her into a trial. As he agonized by her bedside, Meredith became aware of his presence and she imagined him on the beach with her and George, who talked about what he missed about life. Richard talked about trying to stay strong for everyone worrying about her. Meredith apologized to him for that while George pointed out that Richard might break if Meredith decided to stay on her beach. \"I know, George,\" she uttered. Surprised by her sudden communication, indicative of how far gone she was already, Richard decided in favor of the trial.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and George have a heart-to-heart on her beach.]]\nAs they lied down on the sand, Meredith asked George if he regretted having chosen [[Amanda]] over himself. He dodged the question and said out she would have done the same thing, pointing out she contracted COVID- by working the frontlines and thus putting others above herself. She then told him that that was something she had him to thank for, as he had shown her how to go all in for people. He profoundly changed her life yet she never got to tell him that before. The two of them were joined by Richard and Bailey as Meredith became aware of their presence watching over her in real life.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith briefly woke up and was informed by Andrew that they had gotten her into the antibody trial. After having received the treatment, her oxygen needs dropped yet she remained sound asleep. Meredith was briefly joined again on her beach by Bailey, whose mother had been admitted with COVID as well. Bailey had kept from Meredith and Richard that her mother was suffering from Alzheimer's she didn't want to open any old wounds for them, yet with her mother dying, she found herself at a loss when trying to handle the big feelings that came with the impending death of her mother. Meredith tried to show support yet she was too weak to react to her opening up.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Meredith woke up and showed a spectacular recovery. Amelia came in to update her on her kids and Andrew was optimistic they would be able to discharge her within a week if she continued to improve at the current rate. Andrew later returned to her room and she asked for an update on the patient he had taken over from her. He reported only three of them recovered. Meredith wished she could help but Andrew stated that he didn't feel helpful despite his daily shifts in the COVID ward. He was then paged away. Later, Meredith was surprised by a visit from Tom, who had heard from Maggie about her miraculous recovery. Having bribed a nurse to wheel him to Meredith's room, Tom uttered that he needed to be in a room where no one was dying. He broke down and Meredith reached for his hand to comfort him. During a talk about why neurosurgeons are the best lovers, a code blue was called for a patient down the hall. Both of them missed saving lives and were frustrated about having to sit on the sidelines. They overheard that the patient didn't pull through.  As they talked about their kids, a nurse spotted Tom and brought him back to his room. She had a nap and was woken up by a beeping monitor from the patient across the hall. She pulled her own alarm to start a code blue, but when there was no immediate response, Meredith made her way across the hall and started compressions. She intubated the patient with the help of two nurses before the code team arrived. She then collapsed in Taryn's arms. A passed-out Meredith was scanned and her lungs showed significant damage, which Teddy didn't find surprising as the trial drug couldn't reverse damage that already occurred. She suspected Meredith had been on a COVID high and the exertion had pushed her over the edge. Teddy deemed that Meredith's lungs were at a breaking point and suggested they needed to put her on a vent. With more patients surviving recently after having been on a vent, Richard agreed with her suggestion. Meredith was moved to the ICU, where Teddy intubated her and put her on a vent. Meanwhile, Meredith found herself back on her beach, overlooking the ocean.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith remained comatose. She was joined on her beach by Andrew, who had been stabbed while tailing a [[Opal|human trafficker]]. Andrew questioned if they were alive. She thought that they were. They agreed the beach suited them both. Before she could ask, he told her he didn't regret what he had done. People go through life ignoring atrocities all the time but it makes sense to stand up and fight for people, like Meredith had shown him with [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabby]]. Andrew's condition worsened in real life. On the beach, he started building a sandcastle and Meredith warned him about the rising tide, a metaphor for his death. He was aware and worked fast to beat the tide. He said he had more to do, more plans in life. The water then destroyed his castle. Defeated, he admitted he had no clue what would happen now. Meredith didn't know either. He told Meredith he never felt seen the way she saw him. She made him want to be better. He felt small around her sometimes because he wanted something from her that only he could give himself. Being on the beach with her, he finally felt that true acceptance of who he was and what his strengths were. Meredith suggested they take a walk to watch the sunset, but he wanted to hold on to the feeling for a little while longer. With Andrew slipping away on the OR table, he and Meredith ended up watching the sunset. His mother appeared on the beach at a distance and called out for him. Realizing the moment had come, Meredith told Andrew she would miss him if she were to end up going back without him. He told her it would be okay. He realized he had to go now. He got up and eagerly ran towards his mother, who happily embraced him. Andrew briefly turned around and waved at her before walking off into the afterlife with his mother as Meredith watched him leave.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith's numbers slowly began to improve, Teddy began lightening her sedation and ventilator settings. Meredith continued to spend time with Derek on her beach, while Cormac sat by her side asking her to pull through since the hospital couldn't handle another loss after Andrew. Meredith found the obligatory distance between her and Derek to be torture, which he pointed out was her own doing. She brought up that he never got to meet Ellis, but he showcased enough knowledge about her and her resemblance to Meredith as well as Zola writing him letters to inform her that he had been watching over them. Derek also told her that if she wanted to get closer to him, she had to do that herself by relaxing. She tried that, which resulted in the two of them getting a little closer. Meanwhile, Meredith's numbers deteriorated, so Teddy turned back the ventilator settings. Cormac set up a video chat between Zola and a tablet in Meredith's room so Zola could talk to her mother. This as well as Cormac asking her to fight for her kids got through to Meredith and Derek on her beach. Derek told Meredith it was up to her but he advised her to listen to Cormac. She then let him in, replacing Derek on her beach. He talked about her kids and their traits and how they needed for her to fight. Meredith wasn't sure that she could since the beach was comfortable and pain-free. Cormac talked about he loss of his wife impacted their kids and again begged her to fight. Derek then reappeared and told her he would be right there for her. She then decided to fight and walked away from him. Cormac was delighted to see her move her head. He set up a livestream to Andrew's memorial service him, while Meredith herself began pulling away again as she went back to talking to Derek, the distance between them gradually decreasing.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith remained stable on the vent. She appeared in Teddy's subconsciousness as Teddy went catatonic at Andrew's memorial service. Meredith guided her to examine the causes for her behavior over the years, hinting that she had to look further back than her affair with Tom. Eventually, Teddy traced back the root of the issues to her guilt over the loss of Allison and other people in her life, including her parents, Henry, and Andrew, as well as Meredith barely holding on. Meredith told Teddy that all those people couldn't have been saved regardless of Teddy's actions. Meredith pointed out the losses had taught Teddy to run from pain as well joy for thinking she didn't deserve the latter. She said joy and pain are a package deal in life. Meredith got her to accept that. Teddy begged her not to die and Meredith said she would do her best.<ref>[[In My Life]], x</ref>\n\nAs her oxygen sats began improving significantly, Meredith was moved from the ICU to regular room with her ventilator. Her doctors were comfortable with getting her off the vent, yet feared that there would not be a ventilator available for her due to a hospital-wide shortage if she were to trend downward again. Meredith was visited on her beach by Mark and Lexie. Lexie asked her if she was going to stay. Meredith wasn't sure. Mark thought it was too early for her since Zola was only Sofia's age. Meredith told them about Derek but Mark said it wasn't up to him. As she watched Lexie and Mark frolic on the beach, she reiterated that she liked the beach. Later, Mark told Meredith it was nice to talk her, since most of the time people he tried to talking to didn't seem to hear him. Lexie asked Meredith about her favorite thing about life. Meredith replied it felt shallow to talk about that in the middle of a pandemic. Lexie pointed out that didn't mean she wasn't allowed to enjoy her life, stating that the having of a life and body was cause for celebration. If not, there was no point in avoiding death and she may as well just join Derek now. Meredith then told a story of Bailey made everyone laugh by faceplanting into his birthday cake. Meanwhile, Meredith was extubated and remained stable. Back on the beach, Meredith concluded that life is pain, with which Mark and Lexie disagreed. She cited her losses and all the pain in her life. Mark pointed out she knew what caused all the pain. Since Meredith couldn't bring herself to say it, Lexie said the depth of grief came from the depth of love. They advised Meredith not to fight change and resist pain, deeming it a waste of life. Meredith told them she missed them so much. Lexie said they never left her. Together, they told Meredith not to waste a single more minute of life.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\nSince Meredith still didn't wake up despite no longer being sedated and off the vent, Richard ordered a CT to find a possible underlying cause. The CT came back negative. Jo then came in to tell Meredith that she was changing specialties to OB because she needed to find job and her home life wasn't bringing her joy anymore. She hoped Meredith would wake up soon so she could tell her all that again while she was awake. However, she finally woke up later that day and told Richard that she was sorry he had had to decide whether or not to put her on a vent. He told her he would do it again in a heartbeat. Meredith then told him they needed to talk about Jo and shared what Jo had told her before. Soon after, she fell asleep again for the rest of the day.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nMoved back to the ICU, Meredith continued to spend most of the time being asleep. Teddy and Bailey tasked Levi with taking her to the hyperbaric chamber, which they hoped would help. They ended up having to share the chamber with [[James Chee]] and his patient. James asked Levi if Meredith really was as mean as he'd heard. Levi replied that he heard her voice with every win that he booked. He called her his most influential teacher, tough when need be. When the other patient's abdominal wound opened up, Levi handled the situation perfectly with Meredith's guiding voice in his head from when they handled a similar complication together before.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith improved and she was moved back to a regular room, yet remained at all times unconscious or asleep. Her vitals remained stable and imaging showed improvement, confusing her doctors as to why she wasn't waking up. Meredith herself spent more time on her beach with Derek where they talked about his death. He says the worst part was knowing the doctors were getting it wrong and eventually, the desire to rest outweighed the desire to stay. Meredith recalled the moment of giving him her blessing to go. Derek appreciated that she gave him everything he needed until his last breath. Meredith wanted to get closer to Derek yet knew she might never leave the beach if she did. She brought up his handling his father's death and said their children would be okay, too. As they brought up Amelia, Derek told Meredith that people love and need her. Derek knew Meredith was still fighting to live despite feeling tired, since her soul wouldn't let him come close. She inquired if it was hard for him to see her dating other men. He replied it was harder to see her lonely. He commented on her beauty yet acknowledged it felt shallow; she said she taught their children to say \"pretty on the inside.\" Meanwhile, Winston chatted to Meredith, wishing she would wake up to meet him and congratulate him on getting engaged to her sister. Her labs eventually showed elevated liver enzymes. A CT revealed a blood clot in her liver so Teddy and Winston carefully performed a TIPS procedure to remove the clot. \n\nMeanwhile, Meredith told Derek that Ellis draws about the two of them in traditional wedding clothes. As she told that story, they suddenly found themselves wearing exactly that. They held a little impromptu wedding ceremony. Meredith asked Derek what he wanted her to promise. He wanted her to torture herself less. They then leaned into a near-kiss while Meredith said she didn't want to leave the kids. After the procedure, Meredith's labs improved yet she still didn't wake up for hours. Winston then orchestrated a visit from Zola with Maggie and Richard's help. As Zola talked to her mother, all of her close colleagues gathered outside the room. Back on the beach, Derek told Meredith it wasn't her time yet. While she stated she enjoyed the beach where pain didn't exist, he told her he even missed the pain of being alive. He said she needed to go back to their kids. Meredith finally woke up as Zola was talking about allowing Ellis and Bailey into her room. Meredith faintly told her daughter that that was nice of her. Zola hugged her mother and said she loved her. Meredith then told her that \"they\" loved her, too. As the doctors celebrated, Derek walked away from Meredith as she finally chose to live.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith aced her respiratory exams and was prepared to be discharged while Bailey and Richard struggled to tell her about DeLuca's death. As they awaited her final lab results, Maggie and Richard took Meredith for walks down the hallways. Meredith was eager to finally meet her soon-to-be brother-in-law, whose dance moves Zola couldn't shut up about. As Meredith asked for more updates, Richard decides not to tell her about Andrew and told her that Jackson was leaving for Boston to take on a leadership role within the Fox Foundation. When the physical therapist cleared Meredith to go home, she started clearing out her room as Jackson joined her to say goodbye. Meredith said his departure officially made her the last man standing of their residency class. She recalled thinking he had a big name to live up to. Jackson said that name was ruined now but Meredith was confident he could make it his own and re-invent it. She then expressed desire not to face the traditional clap-out, where he planned for their final goodbye to take place. He encouraged her to let people celebrate the win. She told him to \"go give 'em hell\" in Boston and he thanked her for showing him how. Soon after, Richard and Bailey finally gathered the courage to tell her about Andrew. As soon as they brought up his name, Meredith had her experiences echo in her mind and told them that Andrew was with his mother. Meredith decided not to sit through the clap-out and had Jackson sneak her out through the back exit. They laughed as they got in his car and he drove her home. She surprised Amelia and her kids as they were preparing for her arrival. The kids finished their \"welcome home\" sign as they sat with their mother on the couch. Amelia swore they didn't spent months living a chaotic life like this. Meredith enjoyed the chaos and complimented Amelia on keeping her household running. She showed her profound gratitude as Link came rushing in to warn everyone about Meredith's arrival. Much to his surprise, she was already there. He fetched the donuts and Meredith had her kids fill her in on their lives.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref>\n\nDuring her first week of recovery, Meredith found Amelia hovering over her. She urged Amelia to go be of use to the world at work. The next week, Meredith started to be come more active. She was throwing a ball around with her son when Bailey visited. Meredith was exhausted from the activity and asked Bailey to talk about her life to distract her. After a month, Bailey dropped by to give Meredith a suture kit so she could get her dexterity back. Meredith had been reading up on the effects of long-COVID, which terrified her. Bailey tried to encourage her to talk a walk with her but Meredith wasn't feeling up for it. She said she'd never operate again if she couldn't stand on her feet long enough. Picking up her kids felt like running a marathon. Meredith was growing tired of people hovering over her and just wanted her old life back. Two weeks later, Bailey visited again and Meredith said Jackson and Tom had the right idea. She spent weeks fighting to get back to normal but she now realized that normal entailed sexism, racism, inequality, and substandard care. Bailey then proposed Meredith take over the residency program from Richard, who had too many jobs and would step back one day. She asked Meredith to put together a team that reflected their world and take over all the classes and shape them to sandblast bias out of the curriculum for future surgeons. Meredith accepted the job.<ref>[[I'm Still Standing]], x</ref>\n\nIn August , Meredith returned to work as residency director. She decided not to use Richard's infamous speech and instead jumped right in by asking the residents about the status of the newly admitted COVID patients. She later met Cormac in front of the OR board. He assured her she would be operating again soon, which she doubted. He then joked she could have just turned him down when he asked her for that drink rather than getting COVID. She commented that seemed like a lifetime ago and recalled him coming into her room to tell her to fight for her kids. Meredith left work early to attend Maggie's wedding in the backyard, which was postponed indefinitely mid-ceremony. \n\nA month later, Meredith met [[Gerlie Bernardo]], who was being discharged after having spent a month in the hospital with COVID. Having struggled with her own recovery, Gerlie found it reassuring to see Meredith back at work. Meredith sympathized with the residual symptoms Gerlie was experiencing, survivor's guilt being one of them. Meredith confided that that would never go away. Gerlie then collapsed and was re-admitted. Meredith took on her case and used it as a hands-on approach to teach the residents in a more practical manner, substituting the traditional grand rounds. Bailey was surprised with her approach to teaching but Meredith reminded her she was hired to change things around. However, during Gerlie's bronchoscopy, Meredith became dizzy and had to have Maggie take over.\n\nBy Christmas Eve, Gerlie had further deteriorated and had to put on ECMO on Christmas Eve. Meredith took to researching lung transplants in COVID patients. Cormac met her in the attendings' lounge and presented her with a half-empty bottle of whiskey. They finally shared their first drink. The next morning, Amelia, Link, Owen, Teddy, and their kids came over to Meredith's house for Christmas. During the celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy. As the new year began, the hospital received vaccines for the staff. Meredith began advocating for Gerlie to be put on the transplant list but Bailey shut her down, believing Gerlie would recover without the transplant. Meredith then had the residents continually press for the transplant whenever Bailey rounded with them. Bailey confronted Meredith about her tactics but Meredith stated that people suffering from the aftereffects of COVID needed advocates, too. Since she had learned that life could be short, she wanted to teach the residents what mattered most. Bailey then agreed to put Gerlie on the transplant list only if Meredith agreed to re-implement grand rounds.\n\nBy April , Meredith and her kids attended Winston and Maggie's beach wedding. Shortly after the ceremony, Meredith received words that UNOS had found lungs for Gerlie. Teddy and Meredith left the wedding to perform the surgery. As they got started, Meredith said it had helped for her to have a village of people pulling for her with every complication. Since Gerlie had no one, they had to be her village. Meredith rallied and finished the procedure without a problem. Post-procedure, they were met with a round of applause from the surgical staff for Meredith's recovery. As she sat by Gerlie's bedside, Meredith let Cristina know that she successfully performed a double lung transplant. Gerlie woke up surprised to see Meredith by her side; Meredith replied she wasn't going anywhere.<ref>[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter having fully recovered, Meredith and Cormac started seeing each other but their romance was short-lived since it caused his so Austin to suffer from panic attacks. Putting his children first, they quickly ended things.\n\nMeredith was invited to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota by [[David Hamilton]], a former colleague of her mother's, to attend the opening of a research library named after Ellis. While in Minnesota, Meredith was plagued by nightmares in which her mother challenged her to do more with her life than being a regular general surgery attending after having miraculously survived COVID. During her visit to the Clinic, Richard, Bailey, and Cormac called her to remind her of her ties to Grey Sloan and she swore she wasn't there for a job interview. Upon meeting David, he commented she was the spitting image of her mother and guided her to The Grey Center for Medical Research, a research lab he had begun to put together for Meredith if she were interested. He showed her around the lab and its extensive state-of-the-art equipment and explained he was developing cellular therapy for experimental surgery to cure Parkinson's disease. He had everything except a famous surgeon to convince the FDA to grant approval for a clinical trial, revealing that he intended for himself to be the first patient. David invited Meredith to dinner, where she noticed his tremor. David explained her name had become synonymous to cutting-edge and seeing things through to the end. She had him explain the idea behind the project and he stressed the opportunity to become the public face of a possible cure for Parkinson's disease. As she pondered his proposal, she saw [[Nick Marsh]] leaving the restaurant with his date. She told David she wasn't a neurosurgeon but he was confident she would attract the best talent for the project.\n\nUpon returning to the hotel, an employee escorted her to the bar where she found Nick waiting for her. He took a chance and guessed she would be staying at the five-star hotel near the hospital. Over drinks, he said he had spotted her back at the restaurant. His date was horrible. She shared she had just ended things with someone though that didn't mean the two of them would be sleeping together, which he was fine with. He updated her on Charlotte leaving for college and she told him she had survived COVID. He understood being a miracle was a lot of pressure, bearing the question of what you'll be doing with it. Nick walked her back to her room and she explained she would be staying a few more days to look at research. They wished each other good night and shared looks as he walked off. Meredith couldn't help but smile as she closed the door.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\nWhile up to get some water, Meredith heard something and found a note had been slid under her door. She quickly opened her door and called for Nick, who came back from around the corner. He had forgotten to ask for her number and wanted to ask her out on a date without waking her. She happily agreed to a date at a place by the lake. The next morning, Meredith had Amelia flown in from Seattle and informed her about the proposal as she showed her around the lab, stating she wanted Amelia to be part of the project if she were to accept it. After Amelia examined David, they went back to the lab where they met [[Kai Bartley]], a neuroscientist who had already boarded the project. Their work completely convinced Amelia, yet Meredith remained hesitant. Meredith questioned the influence the project would have on their kids' lives. Amelia said revolutionizing medicine would be a great example. Meredith remained on the fence about the consequences of a possible failure. Afterward, Meredith walked Amelia back to her car and thanked her for her input. Meredith locked eyes with Nick while Amelia kept talking about how on board she was with the project.\n\nAt the end of the day, Meredith found Nick waiting for her in the lobby in casual clothes while she had dressed herself up. She changed into something more comfortable. He took her to a favorite spot of his by the lake where he shared that he had cut back on his hours because he was starting to ignore the beautiful world around him. Meredith admitted she was, too. He asked her about the top-secret project she was in town for her. She admitted she was scared to say yes since it was risky, cost millions of dollar, and had the possibility of turning her into a public failure, while she had a safe and comfortable situation in Seattle. Thinking they were of similar nature, Nick knew she would trade all of that in for this project. No matter the outcome, it would be one hell of a ride. Meredith met up with David at the lab and set rules first. She demanded autonomy to pick her team and made sure any progress would be public and accessible to everyone. He agreed to all of those but refused to move the project to Seattle since it would cost them time he didn't have and even more money. Meredith then agreed to travel back and forth once a week. They shook hands as she finally accepted the proposal.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\n\nShe is intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, has good medical instincts, and a natural flair for medicine.\n\nMeredith and Derek have been described as polar opposites. She described herself as \"dark and twisty\" due to her negativity, in contrast to Derek's charismatic optimism. And unlike Derek, who viewed the world in distinct shades of black and white, Meredith tends to see things in shades of gray, which [[Carolyn Shepherd]] remarked to her son that was what he needed, while she was visiting Seattle.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Devil]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, this difference in viewpoints culminated in what was a breach of their marriage, when she messed up Derek's Alzheimer drug trial. She secretly accessed the pharmacy, where the trial drugs were stored, and subsequently swapped the placebo for the actual drug, for Patient #, aka Adele. And when busted by a drunk Alex, who had seen her behaving suspiciously, she much later confided in Cristina that she felt that her actions were justified, as Adele was Richard's wife, and she should do something since Adele was about to have saline injected into her brain, and the trial drug sample could help her from becoming a 'gorked out lump', in her own words. The couple subsequently got into an argument in the changing room, where Derek argued that it was Alzheimer's, a disease that she could potentially have, and one whose progression he was trying to stop or cure, while at the same time espousing that everything was black and white, a right and a wrong. Meredith responded that the situation was much more complicated than that, as it was Richard and Adele.\n\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\n[[Image:der-mer-sex.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Derek wake up after their first encounter.]]\nMeredith and Derek first met at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's Bar]] the night before her first day at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Derek approached her, they got drunk, before ending up at her place, sleeping with each other. When she went to work, she discovered, much to her shock, that Derek too worked at Seattle Grace, as an attending, so she staunchly refused to date him, although they did manage to sneak by a few stolen sexually charged moments. However, it was eventually at the unexpected house party that went out of control that she finally gave in and the two got intimate in the car. Despite Miranda Bailey, who felt that Derek was beginning to show signs of favoritism towards Meredith the following day, catching them in the act, the pair began to date secretly, something which her roommates would eventually discover, and thus were mostly not too pleased about as they thought she was trying to win favors and felt uncomfortable sharing living space with their \"boss's boss.\" They became public quickly, although [[Richard Webber]] discovered and disapproved of the relationship, knowing that Derek was still married to Addison. Their relationship temporarily ended when [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison Shepherd]] arrived at the hospital for a medical case and claimed to be Derek's wife, thereby surprising her.\n\n[[File:Candles.jpg|thumb|px| Meredith and Derek's future house (made of candles).]]\nMeredith stayed away from Derek but later asked him to make a choice between her or Addison. Derek tried to make a decision, but it was a hard one, as he had been married to Addison for eleven years. He eventually chose Addison and Meredith was left heartbroken. Addison stayed at Seattle Grace and Meredith was left alone and when news of the scandal leaked out, she became much of the hospital's talking points and gossip. After avoiding each other, they attempted friendship, but on the night of the Seattle Grace prom, they had sex in an exam room despite the fact that Meredith was dating [[Finn Dandridge]] and Derek was married to Addison. An unexpected event of the secret rendezvous was Meredith losing her panties when Derek had pocketed them. The next day, Addison found Meredith's panties in Derek's pocket and realized her marriage was over. After Derek caught Addison and [[Mark Sloan]] together again, they both admitted their relationship was finished. He told Meredith that if she wanted, they could date and that he loved her. Meredith tried to choose between Derek and Finn, but when she was unable to decide between the two men, she decided to date both of them until she decided. After Derek decided to be a better person and let her go and be with Finn, she realized she wanted Derek and broke up with Finn. She didn't tell Derek immediately because he was going through his divorce with Addison but when she finally did, he no longer cared, as he was suffering from Addison's secret about her and Mark living together for months, after he had left her.\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek and Meredith get engaged.]]\n\nThey started dating again, but Derek later complained that she was constantly leaving him and that she should be worried that the highlight of his week was meeting another girl at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]]. When [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] and [[Preston Burke|Burke]] called off their wedding, she broke up with Derek, not convinced that relationships could work. They tried to stay apart but began having break-up sex, and mockery. Later, Derek kissed a nurse named [[Rose]] in the scrub room; when Meredith found out, she severed all ties with him. Derek and Meredith started a clinical trial but Derek began dating [[Rose]] and her feelings for him started to come back as the clinical trial continued. After their last clinical trial patient survived the surgery, Meredith and Derek celebrated and she showed him a house of candles she had made. He kissed her and they got back together. Trying to take steps forward, Meredith asked him to move in and he accepted. They stayed together and after his mother's visit, Derek decided to propose with his mother's engagement ring. Meredith originally thought he was avoiding her because of a conversation they had about babies, but he insisted that he wanted to have all her babies. Derek planned to propose to her, with a ring from his mother but remarked to Mark that the timing had to be right, otherwise she would bolt. Derek's plans to propose left his mind after he accidentally killed a patient. [[Richard Webber|Richard]] told Meredith about the ring, but the despondent Derek hit the ring into the woods, with a baseball bat. He apologized and she forgave him and he proposed properly to her later. They planned a wedding, but when they realized that Izzie had stage  cancer, they eventually gave their wedding to Izzie and Alex. With very little time to get married themselves, they went to the locker room, wrote down their vows on a Post-it note, and married each other.\n[[File:Postit.jpg|thumb|xpx|The post-it note that married Derek and Meredith.]]\nAfter their Post-it marriage, they referred to each other as husband and wife and in the days immediately after their wedding, they had sex frequently, while often getting caught in the act, in different places in the house, by those living there. Later, she found out she was pregnant. The shooting that happened after the death of a patient of Derek's, when the patient's husband shot numerous people, also shooting Derek was traumatizing for both of them, especially as Meredith miscarried because of the events of that day. She waited to tell him about this long after his recovery wondering how he would react. Then they proceeded to try to conceive, but they learned Meredith had a hostile uterus, which made it unlikely she would conceive naturally.\n\nEventually, the two did formally marry, as it would make it easier for them to legally adopt Zola, an African girl Derek got to know while treating her spina bifida. Derek engaged Meredith in his Alzheimer's clinical trial, trying to find a cure for her mother's disease. When Adele Webber became part of their trial, however, Meredith's emotions started to cloud her judgment, and as a result, she switched the placebo with the active medication, so Adele would get better. This caused Alex to become suspicious when he saw her acting weird. When Alex was drunk, he told Owen Hunt about this incident, who continued to alarm Derek and Richard. Derek then continued to become really angry at Meredith, accusing her of not knowing the difference between right or wrong and saying it wasn't any way to raise a child. It took them a long time to resolve these differences in their marriage and their separation caused trouble with Zola's adoption, for which each blamed the other. However, in times of crisis, they made up and all of them lived happily as a family after Alex, feeling guilty, managed to get them Zola back. Even after enduring the horrible plane crash, in which both her sister and his best friend died, and Derek's hand was severely injured, their bond only grew stronger and they helped each other. Meredith discovered she was pregnant with Derek's child. Though both of them were really happy, Meredith was very concerned due to her hostile uterus, but Derek remained optimistic, and she was still pregnant. During the \"superstorm,\" Meredith gave birth, via c-section, to a baby boy whom she named [[Derek Bailey Shepherd]] after both Derek and [[Miranda Bailey]].<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the birth of Bailey, Meredith and Derek enjoyed their time with their children. Eventually, Derek was offered a job with the president. At first, Meredith was upset as Derek promised her that she could kickstart her career but eventually grew not to mind. They were going to move to DC. but Meredith decided she wanted to stay, so Derek resigned from Grey Sloan.\n\nThe couple argued on and off over his new job and he moved to DC in the heat of the moment. He flew back and forth between Seattle and DC, putting a strain on their marriage. He eventually grew to realize that he was miserable without his family and wanted to be with them more than \"saving the world.\" Meredith also realized that she could live without him, but she didn't want to. They both became very happy once Derek moved back to Seattle. Meredith even told her friends that she had never been happier with her husband and kids. The two were lying in bed together the day before his death and Derek said that she was the one that saved him. On his way back to DC to resign, he got into a car accident and died.<ref>[[How to Save a Life]], x</ref> When Derek died, Meredith was pregnant with their third child, Ellis.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nAfter losing  patients to COVID-, Meredith had been more stressed out than ever, causing a breakdown and a trashed supply closet. Soon after, she was found in the middle of the hospital's parking lot, having collapsed. Suddenly waking up on a beach, Meredith tried to recollect what had just happened, but then a faint voice calls out to her in the distance. After staring long enough at the figure far away, she realizes that it's Derek, waving his arms and smiling. A shocked Meredith catches her breath in realization.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n[[Finn Dandridge]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Meredith and Finn at \"prom\"]]\nFinn Dandridge was a veterinarian to [[Doc]], Meredith and Derek's dog. He met Meredith when Doc got sick and Meredith brought him in. He asked her out and she agreed, despite her and Izzie being celibate. They started a serious relationship and often had sleepovers. At the Seattle Grace prom, Finn said he had plans for his and Meredith's future. Meredith was happy and tried to make the relationship work. However, after an argument with Derek, Meredith ended up cheating on Finn with Derek. Finn found out, and albeit annoyed, he wanted to work past it. Meredith was glad, but she realized she couldn't choose between Finn and Derek, so she started dating them both at the same time until she chose. After a fierce competition, Derek decided to let Meredith go, but as soon as he let her go, Meredith realized she wanted to be with him. She broke up with Finn, who told her Derek was no good for her before he walked out for the last time. His nickname was \"McVet,\" as opposed to Derek's \"McDreamy.\"\n\n[[William Thorpe]]\nWhen William Thorpe and Meredith worked together on a patient, [[Brian Carson]], he flirted with her and asked to follow up with her. She initially didn't realize he was flirting, but once she figured it out, she went back and gave him her personal number.<ref>[[All Eyez on Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Will asks for Meredith's phone number]]\nHe then called her several times, but she didn't answer the phone. Still wanting to pursue her, Will came to the hospital and asked Meredith on a date in person.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith agreed to go get drinks, but panicked and canceled. However, he showed up at the hospital after she got out of surgery and offered to take her home. They got food and ate in the car, talking.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref>\n\nOn their third date, Will and Meredith had sex. However, the morning after, Meredith yelled at Will, asking him to leave immediately. He later came to the house and she told him about Derek and said she thought she was ready, but she wasn't. He said he'd back off for a while and wait, but he'd call and then come back. He believed she was worth waiting for.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nNathan and Meredith were initially at odds, with her disliking him out of loyalty for Owen.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref> Due to Owen's stories, she began to notice he was prone to making rash medical decisions, and their opinions quite often differed. However, she has shown to be able to put her dislike aside so it wouldn't affect patients, or when Nathan told her his side of the story. When Meredith had a bad day, he confronted her about it in the parking lot. They started arguing and ended up having sex in her car.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> It happened four times, but Meredith didn't want him to get too attached to her. He claimed he knew they were just friends who had sex, but during Owen and Amelia's wedding, he smilingly looked at her, indicating he had started to feel more for her.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> Later at the wedding, Nathan and Meredith flirted and he asked her to dance, only for Maggie to interrupt and dance with him, leaving Meredith to watch the two.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref> Nathan continued to try to get closer to Meredith, and although she liked him, she kept brushing him off as she knew Maggie liked him too. Finally, Nathan showed up at Meredith's house, verbally confirming his feelings for her. Meredith lied to him, saying she didn't return the feelings, out of consideration for Maggie. Meredith also warned Nathan that Maggie was going to ask him out, which Nathan believed to be the reason Meredith rejected his pursuits.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex later noticed the way Meredith looked at Nathan, he encouraged her to go after him, but soon changed his mind when he and Nathan disagreed over a case. Meredith told Nathan that butting heads with Alex was not the way to pursue her. Later that day, Nathan told Meredith to stop listening to what people were telling her about him and listen to her own feelings for a change. He admitted he kept thinking about her and that he'd be all in if she wanted it to happen. He left her to think about it, and she decided that she wanted him to give her a reason to go for it. He spent an entire day trying to come up with her but instead told her about how he fell for her the first time he saw her. Meredith then told him to ask her out to dinner, which he did, and she said yes.\n\nHowever, their dinner plans were canceled when Maggie's mother's health took a turn for the worst and Meredith had to support Maggie throughout her mother's treatment. After Diane eventually passed away, Nathan and Meredith agreed that their timing wasn't right to start something between them and indefinitely postponed their dinner plans, since Maggie would heavily rely on Meredith in the near future.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Nathan and Meredith flirt at a dinner party]]\nMeredith and Nathan found themselves sitting next to each other on a plane, both heading to a conference. Meredith went to the bathroom, but Nathan followed her, intent on talking to her about their situation. They ended up having sex. After the plane landed and passengers were tended to, Nathan proposed that they get a hotel room and Meredith accepted.<ref>[[In the Air Tonight]], x</ref>\n\nNathan and Meredith began a relationship, which involved them telling Maggie that they were a couple, and Meredith began to open herself up more to Nathan. He slept over frequently, and Meredith even considered introducing Nathan to her kids over dinner. However, upon the discovery of Nathan's long-lost fianc\uee, Megan, who had been abducted  years ago when they were both in Iraq, Nathan and Meredith abruptly ended their relationship. Although Nathan tried to convince Meredith that he was still in love with her and that Megan didn't want to be with him, Meredith continued to send Nathan back to Megan because she didn't want Nathan to blow his opportunity to rekindle his romance with Megan. Eventually, Nathan moved to Los Angeles to start a new life with Megan. They ended on friendly terms with both of them thanking the other one for what they had meant in each other's lives.\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew drunkenly kissed Meredith, and she rejected his advances, though she told him she was flattered. The next morning, Meredith found herself dreaming about Andrew and was reminded of her thoughts when he apologized at the hospital for kissing her. Meredith continued to dream about Andrew as she began going on dates with the help of her matchmaker patient, [[Cece Colvin|Cece]]. Most of Meredith's dates did not end well while, unbeknownst to her, Andrew realized his feelings for her.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Andrew at Catherine's party]]\n\nWith the encouragement of Jo, Meredith asked out [[Atticus Lincoln]] for drinks, prompting Andrew to finally confess his feelings for Meredith. She told him she had to think about it, but that same day, they got trapped in an elevator during the wind storm. In the elevator, Andrew opened up to Meredith about his difficult childhood back in Italy under his famous surgeon father. Meredith revealed to Andrew that she speaks some Italian, and they grew closer, almost sharing a kiss before the elevator started working again. After working on a surgery together, Andrew proposed that he and Meredith go out on a date before they got interrupted by Link, who reminded Meredith that she had asked him out for drinks. Meredith realized that she was in another love triangle between Andrew and Link.\n\nSometime later, Meredith still hadn't made a decision, but she made a date with Andrew for Alex and Jo's New Year's Eve party. When she stood him up to monitor a patient, he began getting impatient over her indecisiveness. On Valentine's Day, Meredith asked Link out to dinner, but that night, Andrew took her up to the hospital roof for a drink, and the two shared their first kiss.\n\nBecause Maggie had dated Andrew years ago, Meredith wanted to get her approval before starting to date Andrew. When Maggie said she was fine with the relationship, Meredith allowed Andrew to take her out on a date, officially beginning their relationship. At Catherine Avery's party, Meredith and Andrew went off to make out in Jackson's guest room and were caught by Richard, exposing their relationship. Meredith also told Alex that she was dating Andrew, and Alex said that she should report their relationship to HR and that he hoped Andrew makes her happy. After Zola caught Andrew trying to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night, Meredith decided to tell her kids about her relationship with Andrew, which was received well. \n\nWhile working on a case together that involved Meredith committing insurance fraud so that a young immigrant girl could get a surgery she needed, Meredith spent the whole day thinking Andrew disapproved of her breaking the rules. However, he revealed that he was actually in awe of her bravery and that he was afraid of accidentally blurting out that he loves her. With this declaration, Meredith walked out without returning the sentiment and spent some time avoiding Andrew. She told Jo that the 'I love you' scared her because the last person she said it to was Derek. However, after Andrew took the fall for Meredith's insurance fraud and was put in prison, Meredith told him that, as much as it terrified her, she loves him too.\n\nDuring Meredith's trial, she lost her temper at one of the doctors on the panel, the one who'd killed Derek. This led Andrew to realize how much she had respected Derek, and although Meredith warned him not to compare, he didn't feel equal to her. He told her to take some time.\n\nCarina was concerned that Andrew might have the mania that their father had, explaining that that was why he went to jail for Meredith and why he was obsessing over Suzanne Britland's case. Meredith listened, as she already had concerns about Andrew's health, since he wasn't sleeping or eating. She went to Bailey who handed Suzanne's case to her. Meredith completely changed the treatment, which upset Andrew, but after receiving bone marrow test results, he and Lauren realized that Suzanne might have Still's disease. He administered steroids to her, which angered Meredith because if he was wrong, Suzanne would be killed. In the end, Andrew was right. Meredith confronted him about his reckless actions, which Andrew defended, and she brought up the point that he was acting like his father. He told her that he didn't need \"this\" and he didn't need her, breaking up with her for good.\n\n[[Cormac Hayes]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Hayes and Meredith getting coffee]]\nThey dated briefly after a long period of flirting until his son started having panic attacks due to his dating.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nick Marsh]]\nNick performed a kidney transplant at Grey Sloan as a visiting surgeon. When he was about to leave, he collapsed from his own recent kidney transplant and was admitted as a patient. Meredith treated him, and while they waited for his test results, they got to know each other. Later Nick thanked Meredith for saving his life. After work, Meredith told Alex that Nick made her feel something she hadn't felt since Derek, though it didn't matter because Nick lived in Minnesota.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\nYears later, Meredith saw Nick in passing at a restaurant in Minnesota when she was there to consult on another case. Later that night, he found her hotel, and they talked over drinks. He walked her back to her hotel room, and she didn't invite him in.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref> The next morning, he asked her out on a date. They went for dinner overlooking the river, where they talked about Meredith's new project.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith started officially working on the new project in Minnesota, she and Nick started dating. Meredith had trouble with the project's patient, Dr. David Hamilton, who is also on staff at Nick's hospital. Nick gave her advice on how to deal with Hamilton, and later that night, Meredith thanked Nick at dinner.<ref>[[Bottle Up and Explode!]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Nick and Meredith on a weekend getaway]]\nWhen Thanksgiving rolled around, Meredith was stuck in a hotel due to a snow storm. Nick was supposed to stay at his cabin, but when he heard that Meredith couldn't go home for the holidays, he turned around and joined her at her hotel. They ordered room service and spent the night before heading to his cabin the next day.<ref>[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]], x</ref>\n\nDuring one of her trips to Minnesota, Nick asked Meredith to help remove a tumor on one of his patients, but when things started to go wrong, Meredith found out that the patient was actually one of Nick's old friends, the one who had donated a kidney to Nick. She asked Nick to leave the OR because of the conflict of interest. They talked and made up after the surgery.<ref>[[Today Was a Fairytale]], x</ref> They kept dating, flying back and forth between Minnesota and Seattle to see each other. During one trip, Nick operated on a patient at Grey Sloan at Meredith's request, and afterwards, she introduced him to Maggie and Amelia.<ref>[[Living In a House Divided]], x</ref> After Meredith was offered a job in Minnesota, Nick offered that she stay and he move to Seattle to be with her. She started to get angry with him, claiming that she should be able to move and not be stuck at Grey Sloan. Because of the troubles with the teaching program at Grey Sloan, the two decided to stay for a couple weeks until the program was saved and then move to Minnesota.<ref>[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]], x</ref> \n\n\n[[Zola Grey Shepherd]]\n[[File:x-.png|thumb|xpx|Meredith bonds with Zola.]]\nMeredith and Derek met Zola when she was brought to the hospital for an operation as part of Alex's program. The couple had recently been told that Meredith had a hostile uterus and conceiving a child would be hard. Derek immediately bonded with Zola and suggested adoption. Meredith took a little longer to bond but eventually couldn't help falling in love with the child. However, Derek found out that Meredith tampered with his Alzheimer's trial just as the couple was granted temporary custody of Zola. When the social worker on their case, Janet, discovered that Meredith and Derek weren't living together, Zola was taken away from them for a time, during which Meredith and Derek rekindled their relationship. They were given a date to see a judge about the adoption after Alex went to the judge directly. That date was subsequently canceled and Janet told them that it was unlikely that it would end in their favor and suggested that they move on. Then, one night after a long day of work, Janet showed up at their door with Zola and told the couple that she was theirs.\n\n[[Derek Bailey Shepherd]]\nMeredith and Derek's son was a surprise to both because an OB/GYN had described Meredith's uterus as hostile. Meredith surprised Derek with a 'the world's best big sister' t-shirt for Zola to tell him she was pregnant. Meredith went into labor during the superstorm and had to have a C-section after injuring herself earlier from a fall on the stairs. With the lights out, Bailey performed the surgery, and to thank her, Derek and Meredith decided to name their son after her.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref> When Meredith visited her dad as he was dying, she told him Bailey said \"funny\" before saying something.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ellis Shepherd]]\nEllis was conceived before Derek's death. During her birth, Meredith was bleeding heavily. Zola called an ambulance, saving her. When Meredith visited her father before his death, she told him Ellis was really into hip-hop.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\n[[File:.Breakfeast.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith makes Lexie some breakfast.]]\nAlthough Meredith originally hated Lexie, she quickly realized that although she had reason to hate the idea of her, she had no reason to hate Lexie herself. Initially, she didn't like the way Lexie followed her around and seemed envious of her rapport with Derek. She claimed that Lexie was someone she never wanted to know, even denying that Lexie was her sister. However, after Bailey explained that Lexie probably thought she hated her, because of their family links, and after a traumatic day when Cristina brought Lexie home with her, Meredith made an effort to bond with her so they danced and drank tequila. The next morning, Meredith even tried to make breakfast for her and Lexie was so enthusiastic that she ate it, despite knowing she would have an allergic reaction. Lexie and Meredith didn't get too close, both having two different sets of friends, but they did eventually become friends which was made easier with the presence of [[George O'Malley]] who was good friends with both of them. Lexie gave up the apartment that she and George had rented, and moved into the attic of Meredith's house, where she occasionally bemoaned the fact that she didn\ut have a proper room instead. They later become so close, that Meredith gave Thatcher a piece of her liver because Lexie asked her to and she doesn\ut want her sister to feel the loss of her father, something of which she had experienced herself. She also sat with Lexie for  hours, after she has a PTSD breakdown and had to be committed to the psychiatric ward, against her will. And when Lexie got jealous over how April was all chummy with Meredith, she told her the reasons for that, and the fact that \"you're not crazy, you're a Grey and you're my sister, Lexie.\" At the end of Meredith's residency, Lexie died after the plane crash because she was stuck under the debris. Upon hearing of her death, Meredith cried hysterically.\n\nLater, Meredith obsessed over saving a patient's life when she had the same injuries as Lexie after being crushed by a car. At the end of the day, Meredith was talking to Cristina and simply said that \"Lexie's dead.\" From that, it appeared that Meredith had accepted the fact that Lexie was gone and was at peace.\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\n[[File:Ellissaysgoodbye.jpg|thumb|left|px|Ellis tells Meredith to be extraordinary.]]\n\nEllis Grey was the mother of Meredith Grey. Their relationship was strained due to Ellis's devotion to Richard Webber and her work, often forgetting about Meredith. Meredith was a rebellious teenager and she drank excessively and partied during college. However, while traveling in Europe, she received a call and was told that her mother had Alzheimer's. Meredith was made to look after Ellis and keep her secret from the rest who knew her. Ellis would rarely recognize Meredith but one day she woke up and was lucid, but it wouldn't last long, she found herself very disappointed in her daughter who was no longer driven, just \"happy.\" However, before she died, Meredith saw Ellis in a vision and Ellis hugged her and told her she was extraordinary and to continue being extraordinary. Later, Meredith found her mother's old diaries and used them to get to know who her mother was and she realized that she liked her and her mother was quite similar to her best friend, Cristina Yang.\n\n[[Thatcher Grey]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Thatcher apologizes to Lexie and Meredith.]]\nDue to Ellis and Richard's affair, Thatcher left Ellis and Meredith when Meredith was very young. Ellis asked him not to visit and Meredith did not see him again until she was in her thirties and she discovered he had another family. His wife Susan persisted in trying to get them to bond and they began to but when Susan died in surgery, Thatcher blamed Meredith, even going so far as to slap her across the face and asked her not to attend the funeral. Weeks later he arrived back at Seattle Grace and told her he was sorry and so proud of her but Lexie later informed her that he only said it because he was drunk and he did it all the time. Thatcher went into a program and he started making amends. He asked Meredith and Lexie to forgive him, Lexie hugged him and Meredith congratulated him and said good luck and then left the office they were in. Several months later, Thatcher came into Seattle Grace vomiting blood. He was found to have cirrhosis of the liver. He was told that to be put on the transplant list, he had to be sober for at least a year, but he had only been sober for  days. Lexie was not a match for her father's liver, but Meredith was. Willingly, she offers up her liver, not for Thatcher, but for Lexie's sake. Meredith then spent several weeks at home in bed, recovering from the transplant operation. When Thatcher quietly returned to the hospital, with bouts of pain, neither Grey knew, until Miranda Bailey informed them of his check-in. When he revealed that he had a young girlfriend, Meredith was actually happy for him and had to talk to Lexie, who was not too pleased with that discovery. Meredith later visited him in his house upon finding out he had less than a few days to live, and they talked until he passed away.\n\n[[Susan Grey]]\nSusan Grey was the second wife of Meredith's father, Thatcher. After Ellis Grey died, Susan reached out to Meredith and after a rough start, Susan and Meredith bonded. Susan would wash her clothes and make dinner for her and was like a surrogate mother to her. However, she came to Seattle Grace with the hiccups and she died during a relatively easy procedure, due to complications.\n\n[[Doc]]\n[[File:IzGeorgeMerDoc.jpg|thumb|right|px|Meredith and Izzie play with Doc.]]\nDoc was Derek, Addison, and Meredith's dog. She and Izzie rescued him from a shelter and brought him back to their home. Doc was very playful, but he became too much for Izzie and George who quickly demanded that he leave. Due to Meredith's friendship with Derek, Derek and Addison agreed to take him in. After taken to a vet, Doc was diagnosed with bone cancer. When his cancer spread, he was put down and Meredith and Derek agreed to bury him in his favorite spot on Derek's land. During her near-death experience, the very first being she wanted to meet was Doc.\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nMaggie is Meredith's half-sister, daughter of Ellis Grey and Richard Webber. She was adopted as a newborn and moved to Seattle and got a job at GSMH to know more about her biological mother, whom she only knew by name. Meredith and Maggie were immediately in conflict at work. Eventually, it came out that Maggie was Ellis' daughter. Initially, Meredith didn't believe it. The next day, Meredith, helped by Alex, matched the information about Maggie's birth with what she remembered and was able to access about Ellis' hospitalization, and she had to admit that Ellis Grey was actually Maggie's birth mother. After that, Meredith and Maggie ignored each other, but Derek pushed Meredith to make the first move with Maggie (like he had done for Lexie), so Meredith showed Maggie the old diaries of her mother that correspond to the period in which Maggie was conceived.  As time went on, Meredith and Maggie grew closer and now they have a good relationship.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAmelia is Meredith's sister-in-law through her marriage with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]. Their relationship has been rocky since Derek's death. Meredith finds Amelia annoying and doesn't really like her, but they both care for each other as a real family does. Amelia moved with Meredith to her old house after Meredith sold her and Derek's house. Despite a fall-out that resulted in Meredith kicking Amelia out of the house, Amelia continued to watch over her when Meredith was attacked. Meredith, in turn, was there for her wedding and supported her running away before the ceremony. When Amelia was diagnosed with a tumor, Meredith supported her and sat by her side in recovery, as Amelia had refused to call any of her family members. At the start of the pandemic, Amelia was on maternity leave with her son, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] and she and Link cared for Meredith's kids while Meredith worked and continued when Meredith contracted COVID.\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\n[[File:Persons.jpg|thumb|right|px|Cristina calls Meredith her person.]]\n\nCristina bonded with Meredith instantly and their relationship grew, resulting in Cristina and Meredith becoming best friends and each other's [[Person(s)|person]]. They were known around the hospital as the 'Twisted Sisters.' As such, there is very little that the two of them do not know, about the other, since day one of their internships. Meredith frequently talks about her problems with Derek, to her, and all the talk about her and Derek, have been a sore point with Cristina, at least a couple of times. She became Cristina's maid of honor during both weddings to Preston Burke and Owen Hunt. Meredith and Cristina also have several sleepovers at each other's houses, sometimes in Meredith's bed with Derek in it. As well as being one of Cristina's pillars of support, during when she suffered from PTSD, as a result of the shooting.\n\nThey bonded over a complex case on their first day, but the relationship was put to the test after Meredith was chosen for a surgery, instead of Cristina. However, they overcame the obstacle and their friendship grew. After Meredith and Derek's break-up, Cristina protected Meredith by asking Derek to stay away. Outside the hospital, they would hang out at Joe's bar, and in the hospital, they would help each other, wherever possible. Cristina was often there for Meredith during her worst times and vice versa. Meredith was the only person who knew about Cristina's pregnancy, and Cristina about Meredith's. When Addison came to Seattle Grace, Izzie and Cristina stole a patient from psych to make her feel better and when Meredith was put on Erica Hahn's service, Cristina selflessly gave Meredith lots of advice on how to impress Hahn.\n\n[[File:Old, new, borrowed, blue.jpg|thumb|px|left|Cristina gives Meredith something old, new, borrowed and blue for her wedding.]]\n\nThey had their first big fight after Richard Webber blamed Cristina for knowing of the interns' secret meetings and Meredith did not defend her. Although Meredith at first refused to believe Cristina was ignoring her, she eventually accepted it. The two spoke to each other as little as possible, and when they did, they would argue with each other, Meredith even insulted Cristina by saying that to some people things came naturally, but Cristina was one of the people that had to practice. However, after Meredith broke down after attending the execution of a murderer, Derek brought her to Cristina and they made up. They began to bond over [[Ellis Grey's Journals|Meredith's mother's old diaries]] and Meredith found herself comparing Cristina to her mother. When Meredith announced her own wedding, she chose Cristina as her maid of honor.\n\nAfter a fight with Owen, Cristina showed up at Meredith's house. They laid on the floor and talked about her problems. When Owen came to Meredith's house looking for Cristina, Meredith said, \"I already fixed her.\" And Cristina went home with Owen. Also, when both of their husbands were angry with them, Derek at Meredith for tampering with his clinical trial and Owen at Cristina for wanting an abortion, they leaned on each other. Cristina stayed at Meredith's house, both of the men away, and helped take care of baby Zola. They would sleep in the same bed and have routines in the morning.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\n[[File:GeorgeMerSTimeOut.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Meredith apologize during a time-out.]]\n\nFrom the moment [[George O'Malley]] met Meredith, he fell in love with her. Meredith however, was in love with Derek Shepherd so she never really thought about George as more than a friend. Only a patient and George's best friend [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] knew how he felt about Meredith. After a small push from Izzie, George decided to tell Meredith how he felt. Meredith had had a very bad day at work so when George confessed his feelings for her, she thought that maybe George was her guy and she had just overlooked him. They proceeded to kiss but during sex, knowing it wasn't right, Meredith burst into tears. George was humiliated and furious and for weeks, he refused to speak to her. Eventually, he accepted her apology, but admitted that he was partly to blame too, he had known how she felt about Derek and knew that she didn't love George. Their friendship continued and he moved back to her house. When George discovered that he had to repeat his intern year, he drew away from his group of friends, but things soon went back to normal. Meredith and George's friendship continued and was strengthened, as she was his resident. On George's last day at Seattle Grace, he was hit by a bus after pushing [[Amanda]] out of its path. When he was admitted, nobody could recognize him. Meredith was his doctor and she defended him in front of some of the other doctors. After he traced \"[[]]\" on her hand, she realized it was him and had him rushed into the [[Operating Room|O.R.]] George later died, and she and the other doctors at Seattle Grace attended his funeral. As the janitor cleaned out George's cubby, as they \"need(ed) space,\" Meredith realized that what had happened was real and broke down in Derek's arms.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\n[[File:MerIzCristinax.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith gives Izzie her wedding.]]\nMeredith formed a close bond with Izzie on their first day and her relationship with Izzie grew more so when Izzie and George moved in with her. Initially, Izzie was not pleased to know that Meredith was in a relationship with Derek, as she felt that Derek would be favoring her over the other interns, and thus giving her a much better career prospect. She finally learned that Meredith actually loved Derek, and it was not a fling. When George and Meredith were fighting, Izzie told Meredith she would be siding with George if they had to choose sides but fortunately, Meredith and George's issues were soon resolved. Izzie felt close enough to talk to Meredith about her relationship with George and how he pecked her like a chicken and when she discovered that Izzie and George were dating, she supported them. After Izzie was diagnosed with cancer, and when the condition relapsed and Meredith was informed, she and Derek gave their wedding to Alex and Izzie. However, after Izzie left Seattle Grace when she was fired prior to the merger with Mercy West, Izzie refused to answer calls from any of her friends and only returned when a former teacher of hers was sick and sought Derek's help at Seattle Grace. She returned later on after Meredith called her and told her Alex might be moving on, the same night that Alex slept with Lexie. Meredith decided that they should keep it between the three of them. Later that night, Meredith found Izzie cleaning out her old room, ready to leave for good after Alex dumped her. Meredith begged her to stay because this was her home, but Izzie told her that it wasn't. It was just a place she worked at and she could find a new workplace. Meredith was left speechless and walked away.\n\n[[Alex Karev]] \n[[File:AlexMeredithThanksfortheMemories.jpg|thumb|right|px|Alex and Meredith talk.]]\nInitially, Meredith disliked Alex, after he insulted her on the first day of her internship, by calling her a nurse. But when he became Bailey's intern and Izzie made friends with him, Meredith gradually lessened her dislike of Alex. After discovering that Alex failed his board exams, Meredith helped him to study and they occasionally have heartfelt and meaningful conversations. When Izzie was revealed to be quite sick, Meredith offered her wedding to Izzie and Alex and Alex made her his best man for the wedding. When Izzie left the hospital after being fired, Meredith became a source of support. She rang Izzie to tell her to come back because Alex might be moving on, after witnessing Alex and Reed flirting and the next morning she found Lexie and Alex in bed together but advised them to keep it secret. There is no sexual attraction between the two, as shown when Meredith sits in the bathroom and has a girl talk with Alex. while he is in the shower. When Derek walks in and looks at the two of them, she explains by saying he's being a girl for her right now.\n\nHowever, that friendship may have run its course, seeing as how he had sold her out, while in a drunken stupor, to Owen Hunt, while the residents were all in the race for Chief Resident. Meredith subsequently confronted him, in a fit of anger, telling him that she probably will get fired and that she wanted him out of the house by the end of the day. And while he was actually updating the adoption agent, on the medical status of Zola, Meredith had the misconception that Alex was trying to ruin her chances of adopting the child.\n\nHowever, it appeared that with Alex's apology, they mended their fences and went back to their former relationship, as he was there to provide some physical support after Meredith learned that Zola had to be surrendered to Social Services for the time being. Cristina told Alex to help Meredith with trying to keep Zola from being taken from her because Meredith was the only one who \"gave a rat's ass\" about Alex. Alex also spilled to Cristina that she and Meredith were all he had and that they were his family, and that realization made him help Meredith and attempt to get Social Services to let Meredith keep Zola. With the departure of Cristina, Alex became Meredith's new \"person\" and the closest thing to a brother she had.\n\nAfter the death of Derek, Meredith left Seattle without telling anyone where she was going. Despite numerous calls from Alex, she refused to answer. She eventually FaceTimed him, saying that she and the kids were fine and she wished he would stop calling. When she later gave birth to [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], there was a problem and he was her emergency contact person, so the hospital called him and he came to San Diego to see her.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMeredith and Mark first met when Mark came to Seattle Grace to work on a patient. Mark didn't know that Meredith ''was'' Meredith and flirted with her and and soon as Derek saw, he punched him in the face. Mark and Meredith started talking about their problems as their common factors were that they were the Dirty Mistresses of Derek and Addison.\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Sadie returns to Seattle to Meredith.]]\nSadie Harris was Meredith's best friend and she too hated Ellis. Following her graduation from college, when Meredith was in her twenties, she left to go traveling around Europe for two months with Sadie where they partied and drank frequently and experienced some of the adventures of \"Death and Die.\" They had a big fight in Amsterdam, and though they made up and stayed friends, their friendship never truly recovered and they were never as close again. When Meredith received a call about her mother, she left Europe and went back to Seattle. Years later, Sadie made a surprise visit to Meredith's house and became an intern at Seattle Grace. Sadie and Meredith picked up their friendship as though no time had passed, causing Cristina to be extremely jealous. However, when George alerted the chief that Sadie did not seem to have much medical knowledge, she quit and asked Meredith to leave with her. But Meredith said she had a life now and could no longer be sleeping her way through Europe. Sadie told Meredith that the hospital had changed her, but the latter replies that wasn't true: it simply changed what she wanted, and now she wanted to stay in Seattle Grace. Then Sadie left.\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nJackson moved to Seattle Grace through the merger with Mercy West. At first, Meredith did not like Jackson very much. Later, when she found out he was related to Harper Avery, she felt empathy for him. They became friends because she knows what it feels like to have a famous relative. Jackson and Meredith have developed a nice friendship and they are usually nice and happy around each other.\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nWhen April first came to Seattle Grace, Meredith did not approve of her. When April came back after being fired, Meredith liked her even less, because she was way too friendly to Derek. Later, when Derek got shot, Meredith said that April didn't have the right to cry because of Derek, but she told Meredith that Reed, her best friend died. Meredith ended up comforting April, creating a bond. Later, Meredith let April and Jackson move into her house, and she admitted to liking April more and more, after she went off on a tirade, after being continually teased for being a virgin the whole day. Meredith and April appeared to have a relatively friendly relationship, with April often turning to Meredith for advice, and Meredith genuinely being kind to her.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n[[File:CallieClaimsMeredith'sPanties.jpg|thumb|right|px|Callie claims Meredith's panties to protect her.]]\nAlthough Callie and Meredith were friends, they were never great friends. Meredith allowed Callie to move into her house for a while and Callie saved her from embarrassment at work and gave her advice about her dog, but Meredith was better friends with Izzie, who disliked Callie, so she often sided with Izzie in arguments. After George and Callie divorced, Callie moved in with Meredith's best friend, Cristina, so she and Callie bonded a bit more and both of them protected her from Owen Hunt when they thought he might hurt Cristina, after he choked her, while he was asleep. Callie played a big part of Meredith's career at the end of her residency, helping her study for the surgical boards that all th years take, helping Meredith pass. Callie and Meredith also have the common bond of being mothers, which has helped their friendship a great deal. Meredith also helped Callie with her separation from Arizona, the custody hearing, and even comforted her after she lost sole custody of Sofia to Arizona.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\n[[File:RichardandMeredithForgiveEachOther.jpg|thumb|left|px|Meredith and Richard forgive each other.]]\nMeredith Grey and [[Richard Webber]] had a very strained relationship for a very long time. He was the main cause of her parents' divorce and because of him, she was always cast aside. Upon coming to Seattle Grace, they acted civilly, but there were issues under the surface. Because he had been so close to Ellis, he felt close to Meredith, and he was close to her as a child and she thought that he thought he was her father. After she started disregarding his authority, Richard realized that although he was not a bad man, he was the bad man in her story. Richard started becoming frustrated with Meredith and even more so when he looked at her and was frustrated to see [[Ellis Grey]] inside her, the woman whom he loved but had almost ruined his marriage. He never looked Meredith in the eye and eventually, Derek Shepherd spoke to them both. He told Richard that he was the most professional man except for when it came to Meredith Grey, who he didn't always treat as a colleague. Richard apologized to Meredith for his actions in the past, he had been aware that she had grown up alone but never tried to stop it. The two forgave each other and it was proven by his fatherly behavior towards her during her solo surgery and her offering him the diaries of her mother. Meredith later tells a shooter that he should kill her because she is the closest thing Richard has to a daughter. Most of the doctors in the hospital acknowledge Richard and Meredith's relationship, often getting her to use her dead mommy connections to get something.\n\nMeredith also helped get Richard and Catherine back together after their fight.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nMeredith and Owen have had a turbulent relationship, as they have often clashed over Cristina, whom they both care about very much. In the beginning, Meredith was supportive of Owen and Cristina's relationship, but after he strangled Cristina during a PTSD nightmare, she gave him the cold shoulder and kept him away from Cristina. After they got back together, she was civil to Owen for Cristina's sake, although the two shared a few arguments over how to handle Cristina, as Meredith claimed to know her better than Owen did. The cold peace between them finally came to a stop when Meredith learned that he had cheated on Cristina, which resulted in her despising him for a long time. However, Cristina made her accept that she would decide her fate with Owen herself, and Meredith would just have to deal with it. Afterward, her relationship with Owen got better, and upon Cristina's departure, she considered Owen as her friend and promised to be his person for Cristina. That promise soon came to use, as Nathan Riggs' arrival to the hospital caused Owen to become moody and isolated, prompting a worried Meredith to turn to his mother, who revealed her the truth behind Owen's mood.\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nWhen Meredith was publishing her abdominal wall transplant, she wanted to put Jo's name on the paper, but she also needed a picture, and Jo couldn't give a picture because then [[Paul Stadler|Paul]] would find her, so she asked Meredith to take her name off of the article. From that point on, Meredith was very protective of Jo and was even nice to her when [[Alex Karev|Alex]] asked. Then when Paul surprised Jo at the hospital, Meredith was there to comfort her and to keep her safe from Paul. She comforted her by saying \"You're Jo Wilson. I know exactly who you are.\" Meredith kept Alex from Paul, so Alex didn't kill him, and Meredith sat with Jo while she was signing the divorce papers. She also protected her when Paul came back and was threatening Jo for talking to Jenny, Meredith \"called security\" even though the phones weren't working. After that, when Meredith was dealing with the mini spleens in [[Judy Kemp]], Jo wished that a mini-spleen situation would happen for a useful organ, which gave Meredith the idea for her contest entry: mini livers. Since Jo helped find an important piece, she put Jo as her partner for the contest, and they created their mini livers together. After Jo's return to the hospital, Meredith has taken on a sisterly role to Jo, helping her out whenever she needs help.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\n[[File:IntoYouLikeATrainMerBailey.jpg|thumb|left|px|Bailey addresses a drunken Meredith.]]\nBailey was Meredith's resident and had earned the nicknamed \"The Nazi\" before Meredith had started at Seattle Grace. She rarely got involved with people and their problems, unless it affected their work. When [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] found out about Derek and Meredith's relationship, she didn't speak to Meredith and would punish her, by sending her nonsurgical tasks, to even up the playing field when she felt that Derek was favoring her. However, after their break-up, when Derek tried to talk to Meredith, Bailey grew protective and told him not to, that Meredith was hurt and he would just make it worse. Bailey taught Meredith and the interns with a tough-love method. And as the interns became residents, Bailey became friendlier to them, often dispensing advice and chastisement when needed, while still managing to maintain her fearsome professional reputation as a doctor and general surgeon. She attends Derek and Meredith's Christmas dinner to impress her father, and shows a motherly protection over Meredith.\n\nHowever, upon learning of Meredith's tampering with Derek's trial, she voices her strong disapproval of her, as evidenced from her interactions with Meredith, when she got fired, and the Chief, when asked to write a recommendation letter for her.\n\nWhen a storm hit the city, Meredith went into labor and had started bleeding internally after giving birth. All of the surgeons were busy except for Bailey, who at the time was not operating because of her recent MRSA scare, but ultimately decided to save Meredith. Meredith's baby was named after Bailey.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\n[[File:AddisonhugsMeredithx.jpg|thumb|right|px|Addison hugs Meredith.]]\nWhen Addison came to Seattle Grace although she wanted Derek back, she was civil to Meredith and even defended her in front of a mislead patient. In a scrub room, Addison told Meredith that if there was even a chance that Derek still loved her then she wasn't leaving Seattle but she would if he didn't. Derek chose Addison over Meredith, but when Derek and Meredith decided to be friends, Addison tried to be friends with her, too. The three stayed friends, even taking in Meredith's dog, but Addison sometimes felt a tension between the two and realized that everybody knew Derek loved Meredith, except for Derek and Meredith. She and Derek eventually divorced but after a short while, she managed to have a friendship with both of them. The relationship was proven when she came back to Seattle for a visit and hugged Meredith, although she was quite annoyed, and quite tempted to kick her ass physically, after learning that Meredith was letting Derek go off with Rose.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhen Mark first met Meredith, he flirted with her and was punched in the face by Derek. Privately, she labeled him as \ucMcSteamy\ud, and Mark called her \"My Favorite Dirty Mistress,\" while she was high on morphine for pain management. But when he asked her out, she said no because she loved Derek. When Derek forgave Mark for breaking up his marriage and they resumed their friendship with him, Meredith too became friendly towards him, although Mark still threatened her, only half-jokingly, on her wedding day. He later dated her little sister against her wishes, which caused a fight between him and Derek. When the plane crashed and killed Lexie, both she and Mark were left shocked and distraught with Meredith crying hysterically and a depressed Mark had a heart complication.\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\nBecause Burke was dating Cristina, Meredith and Derek were often invited over to their house for dinner and vice versa. She tried to mediate and fix things between Cristina and Burke, after Cristina went to Chief Webber about the tremor in Burke's hand, but to no avail. However, Burke left Cristina on the day of their wedding and there was never any contact between them again.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\nWhen Erica Hahn was hired at Seattle Grace, she almost immediately assigned Meredith to her service in order to see if Meredith had any of her mother's skill. She was impressed by Meredith but when Meredith lied and said she had performed a certain surgery when she hadn't, Hahn told her that if she did it again, she'd never let her operate in her OR again.\n\n\nAfter attending medical school, Meredith secured a spot at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] as a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] and moved from Boston to her mother's house in Seattle. She attended [[Dartmouth College]].\n\nBecause of her mother's reputation, Meredith was often treated differently from other doctors, sometimes favored and sometimes disliked. Meredith showed promise as an intern, she made a difficult diagnosis on her first day and during the rest of her internship, she assisted in several advanced procedures, particularly [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] cases.\n\nAfter correctly diagnosing a patient with a brain tumor, she approached Derek Shepherd with the idea of a clinical trial. On their thirteenth patient, they had a success and the clinical trial was published in a medical journal and named ''The Shepherd Method''. But she was not too pleased, to find that she was not mentioned in the article and was somewhat upset to hear from Derek that he was the one taking the risk, despite her doing all the work.\n\nSoon after, Meredith discovered numerous journals belonging to her mother, while she learned more about her and also picked up some surgical skills and even a doll from her past, Anatomy Jane, which helped her save a young girl.\n\nOn her wedding day, she was given a colon removal operation, from Derek, as her first solo surgery, as a wedding present. Without any intervention from other doctors, she successfully completed the surgery, despite Richard and Mark observing in the background. Richard Webber informed her that her mother would have been proud, while Meredith said that her mother was likely to have been glad that she didn't kill anyone instead.\n\nShe later also performed a solo neurological surgery by herself, as Derek, the attending doctor, was occupied by another patient in another OR. When Derek was setting up the Alzheimer's trial, Meredith was there to assist him. But she was not entirely pleased to find out that he chose Alex, over her, to help him. It was only later, that Alex explained that Meredith was more suited to be his assistant, as she had personal experience, in dealing with the patients and family. But when she tampered with the sample that Adele was supposed to get, Alex suspected that something was amiss. That culminated in him outing her, while he was drunk, and her being suspended, before being fired by the board. Richard took the fall for her, but she and Derek agreed that they shouldn't be close at work too, so Meredith decided to leave neurosurgery.\n\nElecting [[General Surgery|general surgery]] as her [[Surgery#Surgical Specialties|specialty]], Meredith passed the [[Board Certification|boards]] and is now the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[General Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. \n\nShe is also one of the Board Directors at Grey Sloan Memorial.\n\n\n*Meredith's Catch Phrases/Running Gags:\n**.

Paul asked for a recess and shortly afterward, he collapsed and started seizing. Meredith and the others immediately stepped in to treat him. When paramedics arrived, he was taken to the hospital, where a head CT revealed a hemorrhage in his brain. Unable to operate on him herself, Amelia asked Tom to step in and do the craniotomy. Tom agreed and operated. During the surgery, Tom repaired the bleed, but then he had a re-bleed and Tom was unable to save his life.

At the end of the day, Jen begged not to be forced to wait another day, so Derek took her into surgery late at night. He clipped the aneurysm, but Jen was unstable after surgery and he had to be brought back in. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\nJen had difficulty breathing. Derek then consulted with Addison on the case. Addison suggested that the baby could be the problem. They did a doppler and found that the baby was anemic and Jen was mirroring. After running more tests, which showed that the baby was in heart failure, Addison said it was likely due to the blood Jen had gotten during her first surgery being incompatible with the baby. Addison said ideally, she'd do an in utero blood transfusion, but this wasn't ideal. She instead suggested delivering the baby to save Jen's life. Jen declined and said she wanted to wait two weeks to give him a better chance. They asked for another option, so Derek mentioned the transfusion, despite Addison saying it was too risky. Jen insisted that she wanted it. Addison did the transfusion successfully. ''(\"[[Ex-Life]]\")''\n\nJen had to be taken back into surgery in order to stop the mini-strokes she was having. Before her surgery, Rob privately asked that if it came down to a choice between Jen or the baby, to choose Jen. Her surgery was successful, but Jen developed pre-eclampsia. Her patch blew and she had to be rushed back into surgery. In that surgery, Jen died after Derek removed huge portions of her brain to try to save her. Right before she was pronounced dead, Addison delivered her son. Rob was devastated to hear that Jen had died. ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe was married to [[Jen Harmon]] until her death.

''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\nHer pregnancy continued until Amelia went to an appointment at what she believed to be her th week and learned that she was actually  weeks pregnant, injecting doubt into the paternity. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")'' She had a paternity test done and when Link came to her and said he didn't care if he was the father or not, he still wanted to be with her, she told him that he was the father. ''(\"[[Life on Mars?]]\")''\n\nLate in her pregnancy, Amelia had to leave a surgery abruptly because she believed she was in labor. She was surprised to learn that she wasn't and the contractions were just Braxton Hicks. ''(\"[[Sing It Again]]\")''\n\n\nWhile working on Richard's case, Amelia quickly said she needed Tom to take over and then revealed that her water had just broken. She walked to OB, where Carina examined her and said she was five centimeters dilated. She admitted she'd been having contractions all day, but believed they were Braxton Hicks again, so she ignored them. Carina confirmed that she was actually in active labor and monitored her progress. When she was at six centimeters, Link was called away to operate on Richard's hip. While he was gone, Bailey took over coaching and when the time came for Amelia to push, she sat herself behind Amelia's back to help her [[As We Know It|as George had done for her]]. When Link came into the room later, he met his son. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\nAfter his birth, his parents struggled to pick a name for him. His aunt [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] suggested they name him Tony, which his Dad was not a fan of. The considered several different names before eventually deciding on Scout. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, Scout was looked after by his parents, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], and Meredith and spent time with his cousins Zola, Bailey, and Ellis. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")'' During this time, his Dad frequently played guitar for him and his cousins. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nScout went to [[James Shulman]] for his one-year checkup, where he weighed  pounds and was  inches long. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nWhen his parents split up over conflicting desires regarding marriage, Scout began staying at [[Jo's Penthouse]] with his father when he was with him. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Link came to drop Scout off at Meredith's house to spend the day with Amelia, but when he learned Amelia was there alone with the kids, he stayed for the day, saying he didn't want Scout to have to split his holidays like he did as a child. After dinner, Link had a dance party with all four kids. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\n\nScout went with Link, Jo, and Luna to a park for fairytale theater. While they were watching the show, one of the actors, [[Jeremy (Today Was a Fairytale)|Jeremy]], had a sudden cardiac episode and fell onto the stage, injuring himself. Jo and Link immediately jumped in to help. When the ambulance arrived, Link rode to the hospital with Jeremy while Jo took Scout and Luna with her. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith held a dinner party at her house so that everyone could get to know Nick better, Link brought Scout. Scout was fussy and Amelia spent a while trying to get him to sleep. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nOn Halloween, Scout went trick or treating with his cousins. He dressed as an elephant. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\n\nScout had an accident at daycare. The daycare had already used his backup clothes and they hadn't been replaced, so they tried to call his parents. Both of them were in surgery, so they called his cousin, [[Lucas Adams]], to bring him clothes, which he did.

He originally married [[Ellis Grey]], but they divorced and he later married [[Susan Grey]].\ua\n\n\n\nVery little is known about Thatcher Grey's history. At some point, he met and fell in love with Ellis Grey. After their wedding, they had Meredith Grey. When Meredith was five, Ellis left Thatcher. Some time after their divorce, he met Susan Grey, married her, and had two daughters (Lexie Grey and Molly Grey). He did not try to contact Meredith during the time of their -year estrangement. However, he remarried and when they ended up back at Seattle Grace Hospital when Molly was pregnant, Susan, Thatcher's new wife, encouraged them to bond.\n\n\nAfter the realization that she didn't want to make confessional tapes on her deathbed, Meredith looked up her father's address and went to visit him. She asked him why he didn't try harder to stay with her mother and why he just left. He asked if there was anything she needed but\uaMeredith\uasaid that she didn't want anything from him\uaand left. ''(\"[[Yesterday]]\")''\n\n\nThatcher later came to the hospital with his new wife, Susan, and their younger daughter, Molly, when Molly was pregnant. During his visit, Meredith avoided him, not wanting to see him. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\nWhen Laura was four days old, Thatcher was sent to check on Laura because Susan and Molly both had the flu and couldn't. While he was sitting with her, her stomach became distended and he had to give authorization so they could take her into emergency surgery. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\nThatcher was at the hospital with Laura while she recovered from her surgery, visiting her and updating her mother and grandmother on her condition. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Molly was taken in for an emergency c-section, Thatcher was at [[Harvard Medical School]], visiting Lexie. ''(\"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Ellis died, Susan and Thatcher came to the hospital to check on Meredith, to make sure she was okay. Susan also invited Meredith to dinner. Derek convinced her to move the dinner to her own house and said he'd be there to support her. Cristina also volunteered to interrupt  minutes in with a fake crisis in case she needed to bail. When the power went out during dinner, Thatcher left to go flip the fuse, but stayed in the laundry room, needing a break from the dinner. He and Derek chatted about Meredith. Eventually, Thatcher restored the power and rejoined the dinner. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\n\nThatcher came to the hospital with Susan when she had prolonged acid reflux and persistent hiccups. While Susan was in for a procedure that they hoped would stop the reflux, Meredith and Thatcher talked and bonded. They even speculated that Susan was faking the hiccups in order to get them to talk. Thatcher later took Susan home after her procedure. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nThatcher came back to the hospital when Susan had a fever. They started antibiotics for an infection and while she was getting a central line placed, Meredith and Thatcher had lunch in the cafeteria. Susan later had to be rushed into surgery with a very rare complication. Despite their best efforts, she died in surgery. When Meredith delivered the news to him, he slapped her, saying that Susan had trusted her and she let her down. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Susan's funeral, Thatcher came to the hospital drunk and told Meredith not to come. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Susan's death, Thatcher started drinking heavily. Once, when he was trying to go to the store after drinking, Alex offered to go for him to pick up his scotch to keep him from driving drunk. ''(\"[[Physical Attraction... Chemical Reaction]]\")''\n\nAs a result of his alcoholism, he was admitted to [[Seattle Grace Hospital|SGH]] for drunkenness and having his arm put through a window. Meredith stitched him up and they bonded again. Lexie later told Meredith that it was only because he was drunk and that he has mood swings. She gives an example by saying that one day he wrote her a check for  thousand dollars because she deserved everything life had to offer, but just before that, he had called her an ungrateful bitch. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Thatcher and [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]].]]\n\nAfter alienating everyone, he went into rehab and he soon visited Seattle Grace, twenty-nine days sober. [[Richard Webber]] paged the two Grey sisters to his office to listen to Thatcher. After listening to his apology, Meredith wished him good luck, congratulated him, and left. Lexie hugged him and forgave him. That night, he went to dinner at [[Camparos]] with Lexie and Mark. ''(\"[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]]\")''\n\n\nHe is next seen at the hospital with liver disease that was a result of his alcoholism. He was told he needed a liver transplant to survive. UNOS would not allow him to go on the transplant list as he had only been sober for  days and he needed to be at least sober for  year. Lexie automatically volunteered, as it would only mean her losing some of her liver, but she was not a match. Meredith was a match and after some discussion, both Meredith and Thatcher agreed to the operation and it was successful. ''(\"[[Tainted Obligation]]\")''\n\n\nThatcher came to the Christmas party at [[Meredith's House]]. While he was there, he noticed that [[Richard Webber]] was drinking eggnog and warned Meredith about his drinking, though she wasn't concerned. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n\nThatcher came into the hospital with abdominal pain. After some tests, he was diagnosed with a kidney stone which was so large that Bailey operated to remove it. His surgery went well. ''(\"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\")''\n\n\nAfter hearing from a student about their semester abroad, Thatcher decided to make a trip to Zimbabwe himself after Lexie died. He loved it. He came home when he got sick, figuring he'd get it treated and then go back. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Lexie died, Thatcher stayed sober, but lost touch with Meredith. Richard found out through an AA friend that Thatcher had Acute Myeloid Leukemia and is in hospice care\uawith only a few weeks left to live. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\nMeredith avoided visiting him until she learned that Thatcher might not have even a few more days. She came to his house to visit and they talked awkwardly for a while. He told her about Zimbabwe and apologized to her for his absence after Lexie's death. He did tell her he'd come to Derek's funeral, but didn't talk to her because he knew it would be for him and not for her. After this revelation, conversation came easier. She helped him move to his bed when he had difficulty breathing and she told him about Maggie and her kids. When he expressed his regret that he didn't know them, she told him about them. After she finished, he took his final breath and died. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nAlbeit awkward, Thatcher is a loving father to his second family and although he was intimidated when Meredith came to see him years after his divorce with Ellis, he still cared for her in his own way. Susan constantly encouraged him to renew his relationship with Meredith and after a while, they did. However, Susan died very suddenly at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and Thatcher lashed out at Meredith and blamed her for Susan's death, slapping her in the face. He later forbade Meredith to come to Susan's funeral service.\n\n\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\nThey were married for about seven years before his wife began having an affair with [[Richard Webber]]. Eventually, Ellis's affair and time away from home put too much strain on their marriage, and Ellis left with Meredith.\n\nMeredith was a small child at the time of the divorce, and roughly twenty years would pass before they saw each other again. Thatcher blames Ellis somewhat for his estrangement from Meredith, saying Ellis was \"cold\" and wouldn't let him get to know his daughter.\n\n[[Susan Grey]]\nAfter the disintegration of his first family, Thatcher married his second wife, Susan, and had two more daughters, Lexie and Molly. Susan eventually died, causing Thatcher to develop a serious drinking problem.\n\n[[Danielle]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Thatcher introduces Danielle and Lexie.]]\nThatcher met Danielle at one of his AA meetings. They apparently hit it off and he said that she makes him a better person, though he did not inform Lexie that he was dating again. Danielle also had a drinking problem, but had been sober for a while. Lexie originally referred to her as a \"tatted-up skank\", feeling embarrassed and sad that her father had a new girlfriend and had not confided in her. Later on, Lexie apologized to Danielle, and became more friendly. ''(\"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\")''\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith never knew what it was like to have a father, and even went so far as to tell Thatcher this when he came to the hospital for a liver transplant. She never really forgave Thatcher for not fighting for her when he had the chance, and is very cold towards him. They started to make amends when his wife Susan pushed them to, but after Susan's sudden death, Thatcher slapped Meredith, blaming her for his wife's death. Later, when he stopped drinking and told Meredith, she merely wished him good luck. When Thatcher was close to death, Meredith decided to visit him, and they were able to work out things between them. She kept him company until his death.\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nLexie was the daughter of Thatcher and Susan, and they all had a loving family. Thatcher was extremely proud of Lexie's achievements, and as their younger child Molly said, Lexie was the topic of boasting for Thatcher when she began to study medicine in Harvard. Lexie believed that Thatcher was the best father, telling Meredith that he even went to her th grade graduation, which \"wasn't even real\". Lexie was devastated when she did not have a matching liver to her father, but rather Meredith did, and she begged Meredith to give up a piece of her liver to keep Thatcher alive.\n\n\nThatcher was an English professor. When Ellis thought that George was Thatcher, she screamed at him and told him that she didn't care how his day was or about his grants and his students. Meredith also mentioned to Izzie that during dinner with Susan and her father they had discussed his research. It was stated by Meredith that Thatcher got his first job at a university after Ellis \"pulled a few strings\" when she was offered a job.\n\n\n*Both Ellis and [[Richard Webber]] think that [[George O'Malley|George]] bears a slight resemblance to Thatcher.\n*He snored loudly, a trait which his eldest daughter, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], inherited.<ref>[[Six Days, Part ]], x</ref>\n*He had the same blood type as his daughter, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], AB.<ref>[[Tainted Obligation]], x</ref>\n*He liked scotch and gin.<ref>[[Tainted Obligation]], x</ref>\n*His phone number was () -.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Yesterday]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[The Name of the Game]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Six Days, Part ]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Six Days, Part ]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Testing --]]\nThatcherGrey.png|[[Physical Attraction...

''(\"[[She's Gone]]\")''\n\nWhile in foster care, Zola [[Love, Loss and Legacy|came into the hospital]] because her shunt was malfunctioning and that caused an intestinal blockage. She underwent a major surgery performed by Alex Karev and Arizona Robbins. Meredith and Derek were distraught, but they could not see her because the adoption was still under examination. When Alex finally told them the surgery had gone well, Meredith burst into tears and Derek finally forgave her for what happened with the clinical trial. Later that night, they sang a lullaby to her over the phone while [[Cristina Yang]] was taking care of her at the hospital. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\nLater, Meredith and Derek got a hearing to try to regain custody. This was probably thanks to Alex tracking down the judge and telling him that Meredith and Derek were the best possible parents for Zola. ''(\"[[Put Me In, Coach]]\")''\n\nDespite this, not long after that phone call, the social worker told Meredith that since their hearing had been canceled, they were probably not going to get custody. ''(\"[[Dark Was the Night]]\")''\n\nHowever, the following morning, she brought Zola to Meredith and Derek's and told them that the baby was theirs and they had full custody. ''(\"[[Suddenly]]\")''\n\n\nFor Zola's first birthday, her parents planned a party with their friends. However, when the celebration for Richard's ,th surgery had to be canceled, they used the cake Meredith made for the birthday to celebrate that instead. ''(\"[[Hope for the Hopeless]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith and Derek tried to have some time for themselves the morning of Valentine's Day and asked [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] to listen for Zola. She did and they went outside to have some alone time, but shortly thereafter Lexie knocked on the car window carrying Zola and apologized telling them that Zola woke up and really seemed to want them. They all went back inside and Lexie offered to babysit Zola for the night so that they could have some time to themselves since she had no plans. They took her up on the offer and Lexie babysat Zola for the night. \n\nAfter telling [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] earlier in the day that Zola was her hot date for the night Lexie carried Zola around the house, talking to her about whether or not she should go over to Mark's and tell him that she still loves him. When Derek and Meredith got home, Lexie asked if they could take her so that she could leave, but Derek told her to take Zola with her and drive her around as she loved that. Lexie decided to do so and showed up at Mark's apartment with Zola, saying she thought the Zola and Sofia could have a play date and they could talk. She then realized that [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] was there and was making Mark dinner. Mark invited them in and Zola and Sofia had a play date while Mark, Lexie, and Jackson had dinner together. ''(\"[[All You Need is Love]]\")''\n\n\nThe same day Meredith had to leave for San Francisco to take her boards, Zola got sick, which made Meredith feel guilty for leaving her. Derek promised Zola would be fine and took care of her as she threw up on all her clothes, leaving her to wear a bumblebee costume. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was offered a job at The Brigham, the family planned a move to Boston. However, shortly before they were set to leave, her parents were both involved in a plane crash. ''(\"[[Flight]]\")''\n\nDerek still wanted to go to Boston, but Meredith looked at the condition the others were in and said she wanted to stay in Seattle because that's where she started her family. ''(\"[[Remember the Time]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Bailey got her genome lab up and running, Meredith came to her with Zola and said that she wanted to be around to fight for her kid, so she needed to know if she was going to get Alzheimer's. She realized she didn't know anything about Zola's genes, so she wanted Bailey to map her as well. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\n\nWhile at daycare, Zola fell and needed two staples in her head. She'd been promised a princess tea party that day, but because of her parents' busy work schedules, she didn't get it. ''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\n\nFor Halloween, Zola went as a butterfly. Her butterfly wings ripped, so Derek fixed them with [[Ben Warren|Ben's]] help. They when went trick or treating with baby Bailey, plus [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] and her moms. ''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[James Peterson]] proposed to [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], she fled to Seattle to think. She took care of the kids while she was there, something she found difficult. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Derek decided to go to DC to work with the NIH, Zola spent some time sleeping in the bed with Meredith. ''(\"[[Where Do We Go From Here]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek realized what he was missing and said he didn't want to miss anymore, he prepared to move back. ''(\"[[When I Grow Up]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day Derek left for his final trip to DC to tie up loose ends, he was in a car accident. Meredith took Zola and Bailey with her to the hospital, where they stayed with a social worker while Meredith had life support turned off and sat with Derek while he died. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, and Meredith moved to San Diego temporarily after Derek died. Meredith was pregnant with a new baby. Around the time she was due, Meredith's water broke on the kitchen floor. She tried to act like everything was all right, but she fell down and went into labor. Zola saw the blood and asked if she should call . This reminded Meredith of the time her mother slit her wrists and bled out in front of her. Her mom then told Meredith not to dial  yet. Despite remembering that event, Meredith told Zola to call , and she was taken to a hospital. The social worker at the hospital asked Zola if she was the \"smart girl who knew how to call \" and Zola nodded. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Ellis was born, Meredith took her three kids and moved back to Seattle. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\nMeredith decided she couldn't keep living in the house Derek built, so it was sold and they moved back to the house where they lived when they first got Zola with Amelia and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]]. ''(\"[[You're My Home]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Meredith was attacked by a patient, Arizona and Alex brought Zola, Bailey, and Ellis in to see her. However, the three of them were too scared by her appearance and the visit was brief. After she had recovered, the family was happily reunited at home. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was nominated for a Harper Avery, Zola was supposed to go with her to Boston for the ceremony. However, Zola knew her mother didn't like flying, so she wasn't surprised when Meredith decided not to go. Instead, she spent the day with Maggie learning some anatomy. They later watched from the gallery as Meredith watched the feed of the awards and learned she had won. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nZola was asked to be a flower girl at [[Jo and Alex's Wedding]]. They arrived at the wedding to find that most of the guests weren't there because the GPS link on the wedding website sent them to the wrong place. While waiting for the ceremony to begin, Zola and Sofia, who was also a flower girl, played together. After a series of mishaps, including the wedding planner having an allergic reaction to shrimp and being sent to the hospital, the wedding party and guests boarded a ferry, where Alex and Jo were married by Meredith and Zola performed her duties as flower girl. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith came home with new outfits, Zola requested a fashion show. Meredith agreed to show off one outfit because it was late and they needed to get to bed. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Zola's school was having a bake sale, she asked Meredith to make chocolate cookies, not chocolate chip. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\n\nOn Dia De Los Muertos, Zola and her friend, [[Angela]], dressed up and had their faces painted for a parade at their school. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n\nZola attended her brother's fifth birthday party. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Thatcher died, he left presents for Ellis, Bailey, and Zola in his closet. Meredith took those present to her kids and told them about their grandpa. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nZola appeared in one of Meredith's dreams. In the dream her grandmother [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]] told Zola something to tell to her mother, then told her to write it down quickly. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\n\nWhile getting water in the middle of the night, Zola caught [[Andrew DeLuca]] trying to sneak out of the house after a night with Meredith. Later, Meredith sat Zola and her siblings down with ice cream and told them that Andrew was at the house because the two of them had been spending more time together. When Zola asked if Andrew was Meredith's boyfriend, Meredith said yes. Zola was fine with their relationship but requested that Andrew not bring his guitar\ualike the last time he stayed over. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nDuring breakfast, Amelia talked to Meredith about Andrew, and Zola asked if they were talking about Meredith's boyfriend. Amelia said that they were and was surprised that Meredith had told Zola about Andrew. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\n\nJust before Meredith decided to turn herself in to the police for committing insurance fraud, she sat Zola, Bailey, and Ellis down and told them that she would be gone for some time. Zola asked how long Meredith would be gone, and she said just for a little while. Meredith didn't give them details but assured them that Alex, Maggie, and Amelia would be there for them. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nZola came to Meredith one morning saying she felt sick. She had a headache that persisted through breakfast, so Meredith took her to the hospital and demanded that [[Tom Koracick|Tom]] get her a CT immediately, reporting to him Zola's medical history. Tom did the CT, which showed that she just needed a shunt revision, commonly required when children grow. He took her in for surgery, which went smoothly. After her surgery, Zola was awake and recovering. ''(\"[[Breathe Again]]\")''\n\n\nAt Halloween, Zola wore her butterfly costume again. When Andrew tried to help her put the wings on, she got upset with him and said he's not her dad. She later told Andrew that her father had fixed her wings before he died and she didn't want people to forget him. Andrew assured her that that would never happen. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n\nZola came to Meredith one day, saying that she'd finished her science project and she wanted to show Alex. Meredith then had to explain to her that Alex wasn't coming back to Seattle. ''(\"[[Leave a Light On]]\")''\n\n\nZola helped hook up Meredith's computer to the television so she and Meredith could watch [[Richard Webber|Richard]]'s PATH pen presentation together. They watched the presentation, but quickly realized something was wrong. He presented, but wasn't making any sense. Meredith asked Zola to get her phone for her. Shortly afterward, the stream was disconnected. ''(\"[[Love of My Life]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the COVID- pandemic, Zola stayed home with her brother and sister, Amelia, [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]], and her new cousin, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] while her mom treated COVID patients at the hospital and eventually became sick with COVID- herself and had to be admitted. When Amelia realized she'd missed Link's birthday, she convinced the kids to watch a movie by saying it was Link's birthday wish, giving them some free time. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nPrior to her mom getting sick, Zola attended her brother's birthday party that year where he stuck his face right in the cake and then licked the icing off his fingers and made a big production of it. This made Zola, Ellis, Meredith, Amelia, Link, and Maggie laugh. Zola laughed so hard she peed her pants which just made everyone laugh even harder. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith ended up in a coma on a ventilator due to COVID-, Zola overheard Amelia talking about Meredith being sick and became worried that her mom was going to die. Amelia and Maggie later sat down with her and explained to her what was happening. She was worried, but simply said they shouldn't tell Bailey and Ellis unless they had to, because they were too young to understand. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\nShortly after Andrew died, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis had a dance party in the backyard while the grieving adults supervised and tried to figure out how to tell the kids, who had loved Andrew. Zola also later talked to Amelia about living forever and if they'd choose it or not. Zola said if she could create a medicine that would make someone live forever, she'd give it to her mom. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n\nLater, Eric and Maureen Lincoln bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nZola increasingly struggled with her mom being sick, especially after the death of George Floyd. She knew Meredith would be angry as well, but told Maggie she didn't want to go to any protests without her mom. One day, after learning she signed out of her math class early, Maggie talked to Zola about her struggles and encouraged her to scream to express how she was feeling. Later, Winston had the idea to sneak Zola into Meredith's hospital room in the hopes it would encourage her to wake up. After putting Zola in PPE, they walked her through to Meredith's room. She stood by Meredith's bedside and spoke to her until she woke up, then hugged her happily. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her pulmonary studies showed a remarkable improvement in her lung capacity and her labs came out clear, Meredith was discharged from the hospital. Instead of leaving to a fanfare, she had Jackson slip her out the back and drop her off at home, where her kids greeted her happily. Because she hadn't told anyone she was coming, the kids' welcome home poster was unfinished, but she appreciated it anyway and asked her kids to tell her everything that had happened while she was gone. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn August of , Zola attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. However, at the wedding, Maggie's father and Winston's grandmother opposed the wedding, wanting to wait until more people could attend, so the wedding was postponed. In April , a new wedding was planned and they all attended. Zola helped her mother spread flower petals on the beach in preparation for the wedding and then she walked down the aisle with her mother and siblings to spread more flower petals at the start of the ceremony. During the reception Zola, along with both of her siblings, held engagement rings for Link as he proposed to Amelia on the beach after the ceremony. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nAfter working with Addison on a surgery and talking to her about Derek, Meredith invited Addison to her house to meet her kids. They were happy to meet her and asked if she was a friend of their dad's. She said that she was and they immediately got along. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith got stuck in Minnesota when snow caused her flight to be canceled, Amelia was left to cook the meal alone as well as care for all four children by herself. When Link came to drop off Scout and learned this, he decided to stay and help. When he discovered that the oven wasn't on and the turkey was not cooking, he helped her change the meal plan. The kids happily ate the replacement meal when Link said he'd pardoned the turkey. While they ate, Zola asked what an AVM was and Amelia explained. Bailey then asked what sex was, shocking the adults.\n\nAfter dinner, Link and all four kids had a dance party. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nWhen Cormac came to check on Farouk one day, he asked Megan how she was and suggested she go take a break or a nap. Megan told Cormac that if Farouk died, she would die with him. She had survived so much in her life and had no desire to survive Farouk's death. When a heart became available in Tacoma for Farouk, Teddy, Owen, and Cormac went to retrieve it. While they were gone, Winston took Farouk to the OR so he would be ready when the donor heart arrived. Evelyn came to the hospital to sit with Megan while she waited. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nAs Christmas approached, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis helped their mother decorate a Christmas tree at their house. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nZola enjoyed watching her grandmother's surgical tapes, even watching some of them multiple times. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith traveled to Minnesota to finish up the report on Hamilton's surgery and then spend the weekend with Nick, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis spent the weekend with Maggie and Winston. When Ellis hid during a game of hide and seek, she inadvertently discovered a box of Ellis Sr.'s things, including a letter she had written to Maggie many years prior. Zola admitted to Winston that she felt bad for wondering if her birth mother thought about her, because she didn't want Meredith to be sad about it. Winston told her it was normal to wonder where you came from. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith returned home from her trip to Minnesota to present Hamilton's case to the staff at the Mayo, Nick came with her. They brought pizza to her house and he met her three children. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen both Meredith and Zola got sick, they spent the day at home together. Zola was happy when she saw that Meredith was ignoring her work, but questioned why she was avoiding Nick and Hamilton at the end of the day. Meredith explained that she'd been offered a job in Minnesota, one that would require them to move. Zola assured her that she, Bailey, and Ellis would follow her anywhere. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith held a dinner party at her house so that everyone could get to know Nick better, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis attended the party. While they waited for dinner to be ready, they played in the backyard with Amelia and Kai and then played hide and seek. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nZola was excited about the planned move to Minnesota and helped Meredith look at houses there where they could live. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\n\nZola had written a paper about her hero, Ellis Grey, and was a finalist for their merit program. She presented it with her mom, aunts, Winston, and Nick in the audience. During her speech, she started to struggle, saying that because Early Onset Alzheimer's was genetic, her mom and aunt would get it and die and then she'd be alone. When Meredith saw her struggling, she went on stage and comforted her. ''(\"[[Wasn't Expecting That]]\")''\n\nWhen Zola had another panic attack before school, Meredith instead took her to the hospital and told Zola to sit in her office and do homework. Zola left the office and ended up in a lab with Nick, who was impressed with how quickly she figured out the surgical training exercises. She also quickly solved Kai's puzzles, which were extremely difficult even for adults. At the end of the day, Meredith was told she was extremely gifted and this was likely the cause of some of her struggles. ''(\"[[Let's Talk About Sex]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith searched for a school that would meet all of Zola's needs, they celebrated Halloween. Zola dressed as one of the Incredibles. After trick or treating, she went to a sleepover with friends, but she called Meredith part of the way through to pick her up, saying she had started to panic. Meredith assured her that things would get better once they found her the right school. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\nMeredith and Zola went around the country touring schools. In Boston, Zola shadowed at Brookline STEAM Academy. She told Meredith she hated it when they first arrived, but at the end of the day, when Meredith pushed, she admitted that she loved it. Meredith decided they'd be moving to Boston. ''(\"[[When I Get to the Border]]\")''\n\nWith the move incoming, the whole family started preparing for the move. When a lightning storm hit, Maggie and Winston stayed at the house with the kids packing things while Meredith worked. They told the kids to stay inside, despite Zola noting the low odds of them being struck by lightning. Later, the kids were scared when lightning struck the house, starting a fire. They quickly evacuated and were reunited with Meredith outside as they watched the firefighters of [[SFD Station |Station ] try to put out the fire. Meredith assured them that what was most important was that they were all safe. ''(\"[[Thunderstruck]]\")''\n\n\n\nParents\nZola quickly bonded with Derek after he and Meredith decided to try to adopt her. Meredith bonded with her as well, but more slowly.\n\nDerek occasionally struggled with being a white man raising a black daughter. He tried to set up a playdate between Zola and Bailey's much older son, [[William George Bailey Jones|Tuck]], though Bailey shot that idea down. She suggested to him that the reason people were staring wasn't that he's white and Zola's black but because he didn't know how to do Zola's hair and it didn't look good. She showed him how to do Zola's hair properly. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek later learned about [[Maggie Pierce]], he encouraged Meredith to try to bond with her, saying Zola needed more black people in the family because he was running out of ways to braid Zola's hair and Bailey wouldn't show him anymore. ''(\"[[Don't Let's Start]]\")''\n\nAfter baby Bailey was born, Zola's parents worked to make sure she knew she hadn't been replaced by her brother. In order to give Meredith more time for her work, Derek decided to step back from his work and stay home with the kids more. ''(\"[[Map of You]]\")''\n\nSiblings\nAfter her brother Bailey was born, Meredith said Zola wanted to take him to daycare to show him off. ''(\"[[Seal Our Fate]]\")'' Zola has been shown to be very protective of her younger siblings and asked her aunts not to tell them bad news about their mom's condition when she was sick with COVID- unless they absolutely had to. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n\nShe and [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]] are friends. When Zola was gone after Derek died, Sofia asked when she'd be coming back and insisted on getting her a Christmas present. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")'' They frequently had play dates together when they were little and have been seen playing together on multiple occassions and at family events such as birthdays and weddings. \n\n\n*She started to walk shortly after being returned to Meredith and Derek, to the great delight of her parents.<ref>[[This Magic Moment]], x</ref>\n*She really likes her toy giraffe.

As a result of the fall, he had accidentally fired seven nails into his head. When he arrived at the hospital, he was unable to see. The doctors did research into the best way to deal with the situation and only discovered that they should try to get them out as quickly as possible and watch for heavy bleeding. His wife then revealed that he'd been having headaches and dizzy spells, so after Derek removed the nails, he started looking for possible causes. The next morning, Jorge's sight had returned, but an MRI to check for bleeding revealed a tumor on his hypothalamus. Jorge was given his options. He could either have - quality years with focused radiation or he could have the tumor almost completely removed, which would give him - years, but since the tumor was where his personality lived, there was a chance he'd lose his memories and his personality. Jorge decided on the surgery and his wife supported his decision.\n\n\n\nShe is married to Jorge Cruz. They have a very loving relationship. She makes him a cheese omelet every morning for breakfast, which she says is the only thing he likes and he says is the only thing she knows how to make. When they had to choose between - good years or - years with Jorge's personality possibly being altered, Jorge chose the - years, which Zona supported, saying that he's still her Jorge and she'll remember their life together for both of them.\n\n\n*Her favorite color is red.\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n-.jpg\n-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[it:Zona Cruz]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cruz, Zona}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]"}]}}}}
