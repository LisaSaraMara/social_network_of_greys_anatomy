His father was abusive and his mother was schizophrenic. He also spent time in foster care. Before ending up in foster care, Alex acted as a dad to Aaron.\n\n\nAaron came to [[Seattle]] and paid Alex a visit almost seven years after Alex last came home. He showed him his hernia, which Alex guaranteed would be repaired after he got [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Bailey]] to agree to a pro-bono surgery for him. When Aaron found out through [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] and [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] that Alex had gotten married and was going through a divorce, Aaron was livid at Alex for not telling them. The two brothers clashed and fought in the hospital. Aaron tried to back out of the surgery, but ended up having it anyway. They later reconciled and Aaron left. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\")''\n\n\nMonths later, Aaron was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After he tried to kill [[Amber Karev|Amber]], Alex returned to Iowa because he was the only one in the family of legal age and mentally fit to have him committed for treatment, since their mother was also schizophrenic and was off her meds. ''(\"[[Something's Gotta Give]]\")''\n\n\n\nAccording to him, his young sister, Amber, is smart like their older brother, Alex. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\")''\n\n\nAaron is a mover.\n\n\n*When Cristina met him, she thought he was nice, so she nicknamed him \"Angel Spawn\".\n*Although Aaron introduced himself with the surname Karev, [[I Bet It Stung|it was later revealed]] that Karev is his mother's maiden name, and, like [[Alex Karev|Alex]], likely chose to dissociate himself from their father, [[James Evans]], and presumably had it legally changed.\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:Aaron Karev]]\n[[fr:Aaron Karev]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Karev, Aaron}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

These moments allow him to express his real feelings, because spends all day making himself smaller, knowing he's too big, physically and emotionally, thereby tending to hide his real emotions. At some point in his life, Aaron met [[Jeffrey]] and they developed a romantic relationship.\n\n\nUpon noticing he lost his complete upper register, he and Jeffrey came to the\ua[[Emergency Room|ER]]\uato find out what was wrong. As the ER was busy and no one paid immediate attention to him, he started singing loudly to make the doctors hear him and to make them understand the seriousness of the problem.\n\nAfter some initial exams, Drs. Altman, Yang, and Karev found a malignancy on his left lung, which turned out to be pleural mesothelioma, a cancer surrounding the lining of his lung. Upon hearing that in the worst case scenario, his lung would have to be removed, Aaron stated that he rather die than lose his lung, and thus the ability to continue singing.\n\n\nDuring surgery, Teddy found that removing the lung would provide the biggest chance of survival, but because of his statement, she decided to remove the visible tumor and treat him with intrapleural hyperthermic therapy.\n\nAlex informed Jeffrey post-op that Aaron should be fine.\n\n\nAaron stated his feelings are often too big to fit the situation properly, e.g. wanting to kill the waiter when his steak isn't cooked as he asked for. Aaron also tends to look down on others.\n\n\n\nAaron has a relationship with [[Jeffrey]]. Jeffrey stated he does basically everything to take care of Aaron, and still Aaron thinks little of him.\n\n\nAaron is a singer, and has been described as an incredibly good one.

Like I said\u I'm not big into change.|[[Alex Karev]]}}\n\n'''Alex Karev''' is the former [[Chief of Surgery]] at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] and former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of\ua[[Pediatric Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He is the father of twins,\ua[[Alexis Stevens|Alexis]] and [[Eli Stevens|Eli]], with his ex-wife and current partner,\ua[[Izzie Stevens]]. He was also married to\ua[[Jo Wilson]] before learning about Eli and Alexis.\n\n\n\nWhen Alex was seven, he had to start cleaning up his drunk and drug addict father. At that point, he became the adult of the family as his mother was schizophrenic. Alex described himself as being \"raised in a bar\" and that his father never took him to the park or camping.<ref>[[Where the Boys Are]], x</ref>\n\nAs a kid, Alex was fat, and in th or th grade, the other kids started to pick on him for it. He was called names and pranked and even shoved in a locker once. He then started to think of himself as the fat kid in class and the screw-up at home. It was hell for him until the summer after the th grade, when he spent the entire summer school break on his bike riding everywhere. He lost so much weight that people barely recognized him when school started again.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Alex's father left he took care of his mother and his siblings. Alex was in  different foster homes in the course of  years. He also spent time in juvenile detention for stealing food for his family.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Parents]], x</ref> He also admitted his mother into a psychiatric facility at one point. When he was , he stole a car to help his little sister Amber.\n\nAlex lost his virginity to a school nurse when he was .<ref>[[Can't Fight Biology]], \ud</ref>\n\nHe missed his high school prom because his father came home and was drunk and started to break things at the house, so Alex stayed home with him. He had a prom date whom he liked and even got her a bracelet, but he never talked to her again because he felt that he stood her up and thought she wouldn't want to talk to him again.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nAt some point, Alex legally changed his last name to Karev, his mother's maiden name, to disassociate himself from his father, [[James Evans]].\n\nAfter Alex's grandmother died, he had a dream where she told him not to play with his ''parts''.\n\nHe attended college at [[University of Iowa]], where he wrestled.\n\n\nAlex started his internship at the same day [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[George O'Malley|George]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] did. He was at first assigned to a different resident, named Jeremy, than the other four. On his first day, Meredith saved one of his patients from a post-op complication in front of the chief after Alex dismissed the nurse and Meredith several times. He joined Miranda Bailey's service later, after his first resident gave him up for unknown reasons. He didn't get along with his colleagues due to his work attitude. For example, he would only pick the good and interesting cases and steal them from his colleagues. After a few weeks, the other interns learned of his softer, more understanding side and they became friends. Izzie took a particular liking to him and was first to notice the other, nicer side of him.\n\nIn the beginning, he told everyone that his dream specialty was [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]], but after he got to know the specialty closer, Alex discovered that it wasn't for him. He wanted to go into plastics because most of the time the patients there willingly chose their pain. After a longer stint with [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], Alex discovered that he liked to work with infants and began to develop a keen interest in [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]].\n\n\nAlex rescued [[Rebecca Pope|Rebecca]] while she was pregnant during the [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] accident. He also helped her pick a \"new face\" for Dr. Sloan to construct. Because of her new face and because she couldn't remember her real name, Alex nicknamed her Ava. Later on, Rebecca returned and they had a brief relationship during which she believed he got her pregnant (which was investigated by Izzie and turned out to be false). A bit later, under pressure from Izzie, Ava revealed the truth to Alex. Before she came back to Seattle, Ava had developed a borderline personality disorder. A part of this disorder was that she had forgotten that she already had a baby. Alex took care of her during her second stint in Seattle, but he couldn't prevent Ava's suicide attempt. Alex found her in Meredith's kitchen and took her to the ER, where she was treated by Izzie. Izzie pressured Alex to get her admitted to the psych ward. At first, Alex wouldn't allow that and told Izzie that she was \"only going through a bad patch\", and that he could take care of her. After a long talk with Izzie, Alex admitted that Ava needed help and that he couldn't give it to her.\ua\n\n\nAlex and Izzie had a rocky start to their relationship. In the beginning, Izzie disliked him as he was arrogant and cocky. He even plastered her modeling photos around the hospital to humiliate her. Izzie eventually saw the softer side of him and they had an on and off relationship. Alex and Izzie got married after a tumor was removed from her brain, but a second one was found by [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Shepherd]]. Izzie made a treatment error that endangered the life of a patient, and she ended up getting fired from the Surgical Program. She believed that her getting fired was partially Alex's fault, so she wrote him a Dear John letter and left Seattle. Then, she returned and attempted to get back together with Alex, but he refused because of the fact that she had left him, and they ultimately got divorced.\n\n\nAlex got shot in the lower chest by [[Gary Clark]] upon discovering him standing over Reed's body. After Gary had walked off, Alex dragged himself onto an elevator and got discovered by Mark and Lexie. They took him to an empty conference room and put in a chest tube.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref> Alex thought he was dying and advised Mark to have more sex and eat more bacon. Lexie confessed her love for him as he received a blood transfusion, but Alex mistook her for Izzie. He told her he was happy that she came back for him and asked her not to leave him again. Soon after, they were evacuated by a SWAT member and transported to [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital|Seattle Pres]], where [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] operated on him.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlex and his fellow fourth year residents began the race for the position of chief resident. Alex initially fell behind in the race because he didn't have any projects to work on while his peers were going off on their own. However, an idea was planted into his head when he joined Robbins in looking at scans of a patient in need of surgery. When he asked if he could scrub in, Robbins informed him that the child was in Africa and wouldn't be getting the surgery because she needed to stay to care for [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|her own sick child]] who was in the NICU at the time.\uaIt would cost too much to fly him out herself and she was at a loss as to getting someone who was willing to bring that kid, plus the dozen others, to the US for surgery.\n\nLater, when prompted by Owen about his plans for chief resident, Alex impulsively blurted out a plan to bring over a group of African kids for much needed surgeries.\uaFrom that point, Alex committed himself to the Africa Project, despite a rocky start.\uaHe initially presented his plan to Dr. Stark, asking for the help and money he needed to get the project off the ground. Stark denied him, however, because despite all of Alex's good intentions, he wasn't good at organizing the logistic part of the project, coming off as disorganized and \"half-assed\", according to Stark.\n\nResorting to Plan B, Alex went to one of his rich patients, [[Gladys Pulcher]], who was suffering from late stage lung cancer. Pulcher, dubbed \"Dragon Lady\" by Alex because of her constant cold and mean spirited remarks, refused and threatened to sue him and the hospital. Alex persisted, however, going as far as to show her pictures of the many sick kids before she sent him away. She asked for him later when Lexie was having trouble moving her without causing pain. He refused to help unless she agreed to give him money for his project.\uaShe agreed and Alex walked away victorious. His glee was short lived as Pulcher coded and died soon after.\n\nDespite the financial setback, Alex proceeded with his plans, first charging his credit cards and then giving \"I owe you\" promises until the children were set to arrive. Frantic and crumbling under the pressure of owing so much money and living up to the expectations he had set up for these kids, Alex nearly had a meltdown. He attempted to run away from the problem, ignoring Lexie who was hounding him about the debt, and instead, focusing on helping the kids.\uaHowever, a check came in the mail just in time from the lawyer handling the estate of Gladys Pulcher, giving Alex two hundred thousand dollars and essentially funding the project.\n\nThe children arrived and the surgeons of Seattle Grace Mercy West were able to give them their surgeries successfully. The project put Alex as the front runner in the race for chief resident.\n\nThe project was temporarily threatened when a new doctor, [[Mel Barnett|Dr. Mel Barnett]], took over for Robbins while she recovered after the plane crash and her amputation.\uaAccording to Barnett, the project didn't fit in his agenda for pediatrics and would have been shipped over to a different hospital. This, however, did not happen as Alex stayed in Seattle instead of going to Baltimore to do his fellowship at Johns Hopkins.\n\n\nWhen Meredith was working on Derek's Alzheimer's trial, Alex spotted her walking down the hall with a trial packet under her lab coat. She convinced him not to rat her out for a while, saying \"Nothing I did changes anything.\" However, the race for chief resident was on and when Meredith became a top contestant, Alex told Hunt what he saw her do while drinking at Joe's. Meredith retaliated by kicking Alex out of her house, despite his many apologies. When Richard found out that she switched the packets so Adele would receive the active ingredient, he decided to take the fall for her and Meredith was able to keep her job and she eventually forgave Alex.\n\n\nWhen the residents first began applying for [[Fellow|fellowships]], Alex was concerned because the interviews Robbins lined up were all at second rate hospitals. However, he soon discovered that Robbins was only doing this to convince him to stay at Seattle Grace Mercy West, and began to get calls from the country's top hospitals. He verbally committed to staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West and being Arizona's fellow. However, after [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] created a fellowship spot just for him, he decided to take that spot, angering Arizona and leading her to take his spot on the plane that ultimately crashed. His guilt over her replacing him led him to agree to stay in [[Seattle]] while she recovered, even amputating her leg himself when the time came. After delaying his move to Johns Hopkins for months, he eventually decided to stay in Seattle and take Arizona's fellowship.\n\n\nAlex and Jo begin dating after them both denying their feelings for each other. Jo and Alex fight over his father, but Alex realizes Jo was doing it because she loved him. They both were in foster care growing up. Alex proposes although Jo does not realize that that's what he was doing until he introduces her as his fianc\uee. When the board introduces the non fraternization policy, they fake a break up. Meredith finds a solution in a love contract, which they both have to sign, which states that their relationship is consensual.\n\nAlex didn't have an easy relationship with his father, [[James Evans]]. James abused Alex, his mother, and his siblings when they were young. James struggled all his life with a drug and alcohol addiction. At age , Alex stood up to his father, beat him up, and threw him out of the house. Alex later admitted to a patient that he had gone too far.\n\nYears later, Alex met his father again at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] after James was admitted to the ER. James and two of his friends were in a car crash and they were obviously on some drugs. It is later confirmed that the drug of his choice is heroin. After Alex recognized his father, he couldn't find the courage to speak with him in the hospital. After James was discharged, Alex tracked him down in a bar, but still couldn't find the courage to talk to him. Alex visited the bar the night after his initial visit and after a few drinks, he got into a fight with his father once again. After that fight, James recognized Alex as his son. He said he recognized Alex because of his angry eyes, which were the same when Alex was . After that incident, Alex left James for good. A while later, James came back to the hospital after quitting the drugs cold turkey. He said to [[Jo Wilson|Jo]] that he wanted to get clean for his family. At first, Alex declined to help him. After a while and a little push from Jo, Alex made up his mind and at least tried to help and talk to his dad.\n\nAfter [[Shane Ross|Shane]] froze while operating on James's heart, Alex was angry at Shane and tried to make his dad happy. He even went so far to lie to James's [[Naomi Evans|second ex-wife]] to get her to visit James. When James died, Alex was relieved and sad at the same time. Shane tried to apologize to Alex, but he was still angry at him and Alex beat him up in front of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[Jo Wilson|Jo]]. Alex only stopped because Meredith held him back.\n\n\nAlex left GSM temporarily to join a private practice with [[Oliver Lebackes]]\uafor the purpose of making enough money to pay off his medical school debts. When\ua[[Maggie Pierce|Pierce]] accidentally revealed in the OR that Alex was looking for a spot on the board, Lebackes fired him on the spot. Even though he didn't get the spot, GSM hired him back as an attending peds surgeon.\n\n\nWhen surgical intern Andrew DeLuca was helping Jo get into bed after a night of drinking, Alex walked in and saw Andrew on top of her. Assuming that Andrew was sexually assaulting her, Alex violently physically assaulted Andrew, leading to the former temporarily injuring his hand and the latter sustaining several critical injuries. When Meredith figured out that Alex was the one who had caused the damage to Andrew, she promised not to tell anyone, even going to the extent to lie to her colleagues about Alex's guilt.<ref>[[Undo]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew decided to press charges, Alex and his attorney thought it was for a misdemeanor, but quickly learned that the state had upped the charge to felony assault. Alex pled not guilty, When Bailey found out that one of her attending pediatric surgeons was charged with a felony, she was forced to suspend him from the surgical staff and offered him a position in the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]], which he accepted.<ref>[[Catastrophe and the Cure]], x</ref> While working in the clinic, he had to get surgical consults, as he did not have surgical privileges. This, as well as being supervised by a nurse, led to Alex being quite frustrated with his temporary assignment.<ref>[[Falling Slowly]], x</ref>\n\nThe day before the trial, Alex talked to Meredith and Maggie about how it was his \"last day on earth,\" and how they needed to drink that evening, despite Meredith's assurance that the trial would go well. After learning that Jo was married, which she was worried about being discovered during the trial, Alex decided to take the plea deal, which involved him serving two years.<ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\nAlex went to the District Attorney's office to take the plea deal, but Andrew unexpectedly walked in and tried to drop all charges against Alex. When he was told that since the case belonged to the state, he could not do that, he threatened to sabotage the case, which the attorney said was \"a slam dunk.\" Andrew walked out before Alex could understand why he decided to drop the charges. The two eventually had a conversation outside of the hospital in which Andrew says that he did it to protect Jo, and expressed frustration that Alex never apologized when he had the chance. After a meeting, Bailey offered to reinstate Alex with full surgical privileges once she received the papers showing that the charges had been dropped.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\n\nAlex tracked down Jo's husband, [[Paul Stadler]], and spied on him at a medical conference. He told Meredith that he planned to confront Paul, but never actually spoke to him. He later revealed to Jo that he saw Paul but didn't act violently towards him like Jo thought he would. Alex and Jo then got back together after Jo realized that she could trust him. Soon after, she invited him to move back into the loft by holding up a sign reading \"Homecoming?\", a move inspired by a shared patient.\n\nJo found herself hesitant to be included in an article about Meredith's surgery, as it showcased how much control her husband still had over her. When presented with the opportunity to become Chief Resident, she decided she was done hiding and filed for divorce from Paul. On her first day as Chief Resident, Jo was shocked when Paul showed up at the hospital with the divorce papers. Meredith stepped in and told Alex to stay away from Paul as he wanted to beat the guy up, so she helped Jo handle the divorce. The next day, Paul was brought in after a hit-and-run, which Meredith incorrectly\uafirst suspected was Alex and Jo's doing. Alex stayed clear of Paul's room per Meredith's instructions, but he stood by Jo as she was left with the decision about what to do with Paul after he slipped in an act of aggression towards Jo and his new fianc\uee Jenny and was declared brain dead. She chose to donate his organs and was overwhelmed with relief to finally be free.\n\n\nAlex came home and Jo was waiting for him. Jo started to say that she never fit in\uaanywhere and that's why she always ran. She continued to say that maybe she ran from anyone who ever loved her. Alex paused her and started to look for the ring. He couldn't find it because Jo was already wearing it. Jo knelt down in front of Alex and said she didn't want to go anywhere without him and he is her home. She asked if he wanted to marry her. He said yes.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nAfter months of being engaged, Alex and Jo arrived at the big day. However, everything that could go wrong, did. While the wedding was delayed by people going to the wrong address and minister being late, Alex and Jo snuck off to have sex in a shed and got locked in. When they were finally saved by Meredith and Andrew, they returned to the wedding site to find their wedding planner having a serious allergic reaction. The final straw was when [[Levi Schmitt]]\uafainted at the sight of blood and knocked over the wedding cake. Alex and Jo decided to get married at sea on a ferryboat, with their ceremony being officiated by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile on their honeymoon in Los Angeles, Jo talked about an article she had read on cancer cells. It felt new to her, while Boston didn't. Alex said he wouldn't mind for their kids to grow up in Boston. Jo then said she had a thought and ran off from the beach.\n[[File:xAlexKarev.png|thumb|Jo needs to work on her idea.]]\nThinking he had talked about kids too fast, he found her at a beach bar and apologized. She told him at wasn't about the kids. She had an idea and she needed to focus, so she asked him to shut up while she was writing things down on a napkin. The bartender treated Alex to a beer on the house. Jo retreated back to their hotel room, while Alex spent the day enjoying himself outside. When he came back, Jo presented him with her idea to design cancer killer cells by introducing suicide genes in the cancer cell DNA. She feared he hated her for ruining her the honeymoon, but he was just delighted that she agreed to marry him and commented that their kids would be very smart.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nThey returned to Seattle the next day and they talked to Meredith about creating a surgical innovation fellowship just for Jo. Meredith took the idea to Bailey, who told her there was no room on the budget unless she did not re-hire Alex, as they had just spent a lot of money on the hyperbaric medicine lab. Meredith then told Jo to go to Boston and come back when they found the money, but Jo had already turned Boston down by that point. Both out of a job, they went to Joe's for day drinking. Jo revealed she had only applied for Boston because she could, but she did not really want to move there as it felt like going backwards. Jo then decided to go back to Bailey and explain why she was the future of medicine. The meeting was very productive for the couple. Bailey decided to fund the fellowship with her own money and appointed Alex interim Chief of Surgery, as she herself needed a sabbatical. Meredith was not happy about the move but Alex told her she still got him around this way and that it was time for Jo to move on to her own stuff.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|As Chief, Alex throws Richard off his patient's case.]]\nAlex was thrown in the deep end of the pool on his first day as Chief. He signed off on Link's project to -D print prosthetics for kids. Alex feared that Bailey only picked him because he would never live up to her, so that she would be welcomed back with open arms after her sabbatical, but she told him that she did trust him to do the job. However, he messed up the OR board, missed appointments with his peds patients, and later butted heads with Richard when he wouldn't stop berating a supposedly drunk patient. He found some comfort with Meredith, who told him that every Chief always feel like they're pissing people off and doing a poor job. At the end of the day, Alex fired Vik when he lost a patient due to not taking his nosebleed seriously and did not take responsibility for it. Bailey checked on his work and found that he had spent the entire quarter's budget in one day. Jo left them to talk so they could correct his mistake.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAlex hated the job because everyone kept asking for stuff, including his wife. He froze some funding he had approved earlier, including Link's project. Alex got himself a case of a [[Julius Guerra|young man]] with a pulmonary bleb, but the man refused surgery because his insurance wouldn't cover it. Alex paged Richard for advice, but he refused to do Alex's job for him. He only told him being Chief is finding creative ways to get out of corners you've been backed into. Alex wanted to quit, but Richard told him you only quit when you've tried something to the best of your abilities, otherwise it's just failing. Alex then get creative and made a small cut in the patient's chest so that the surgery would qualify as a trauma surgery. Richard yelled at him, but Alex told him about the time when he was  and he stole his neighbor's car to drive his sister, who was spiking a fever, to the hospital. Like Alex had hoped, the patient was happy to have his bleb removed and wouldn't report it. Alex was delighted to have found his groove as Chief. While heading home, Alex and Jo ran into Link, who apparently knew Jo from her past life as Brooke.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nAlex found out that Link and Jo had worked together waiting tables and that he was like a brother to her, but Alex gave him the cold shoulder while they working together on [[Rafi Elshami]]. Link noticed his threatening and dismissive demeanor and assured him that he and Jo had not been involved romantically. Alex then revealed that his problem was that Link had not protected her from Paul like a good brother would have. Link said he tried to tell her that he did not like Paul, but then Paul grew jealous and made Jo back away. He thought he was being respectful in honoring the distance, but he would not have if he had known that Paul was abusing her. Alex then warmed up to him. While he was catching up on paperwork after the surgery, Jo came by and he told her that Link was a great guy. He and Jo then started doing honeymoon things in the office.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nJo started helping Alex out a bit at work because the workload made him grumpy all the time. Jo and Bailey revived a liver with a perfusion system, but Alex ordered them to shut it down because it could risk their standing with UNOS. He later operated with Meredith on [[Flor Medina]] and they discussed Meredith's father's impending death from AML. He advised her to go see him, because he found it had been good for him to be able to say goodbye to his own father. After the surgery, he found out that Jo and Bailey had gone against his orders and were performing a transplant with the revived liver. While angry at first, the transplant worked, so he then took Jo into his office and admitted to being turned on by her genius. They closed the blinds in his office when they wer spotted kissing by [[Frankie Shavelson|nurse Frankie]]. That night, they invited Link to the loft so Jo could properly cut his hair and Meredith came over, too, when she found herself in need of company. She took over from Jo and Alex and Jo agreed that Meredith and Link looked good together.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWhen nurse Frankie got in distress, Alex found that the entire nursing staff was worried about her and assisted Richard in surgery. Alex delivered the baby and took care of him himself so as to provide the best possible care. Alex himself had to call time on death on Frankie as Richard wouldn't give up. Her baby survived and was watched closely by a group of nurses.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nAlex and Jo overslept on the day that a wind storm hit Seattle. They jumped out of bed to leave for work, but found that the storm made it unsafe to leave their house. Alex then had Bailey cover him. He found out how understaffed the hospital was, making him feel like a crappy leader. To cheer him up, Jo decided they could have a second honeymoon while staying in. Alex struggled to get reception so he had a hard time staying up to date with business at the hospital. He and Jo discovered neither of them had mailed in their marriage license, meaning their marriage wasn't official yet. They then went through all their wedding gifts. April had registered for them so they ended up with a bunch of stuff they didn't need. They agreed to return most of it and buy a bigger television with the money they'd get back. They then resorted to drink beer out of fancy glasses and making out.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nAs soon as he heard the bridge had been re-opened, Alex left for work. He caught Levi and Nico getting dressed after sex in an ambulance and was ordered by Bailey to step in for her in harvesting [[Phoebe Moss|Phoebe Moss']] organs so she could go take care of the hospital. He later confronted her about the way she had spoken to him. Bailey admitted that she was in crisis back then and didn't trust herself to finish the surgery. She told him she still needed more time to work on herself and asked him not to quit. He agreed not to and help her out in any way she needed. He later called out Nico and Levi for what they did and directed them to rooms with doors that lock.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAlex settled in the Chief job and got the hang of it. When Teddy was looking for a job, Bailey referred her to Alex, who made her audition for Maggie. Jo had been treating [[Natasha Deon]] all day and thanked Alex for being alive and having married her. Alex heard about Andrew stepping up and performing a solo surgery when Owen was accidentally paralyzed in the OR and congratulated him on pulling it off.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex and Jo get in a festive mood.]]\nWith the holidays approaching, Alex chose to gift everyone on staff a ham. He and Jo organized a navy blue scrubs only NYE party at their loft. The two of them handed out beers before the countdown and kissed at midnight. At work, Alex came up with an idea to give Natasha and [[Garrett Boland]] the wedding under the stars they had always wanted. Meredith officiated with all doctors holding up their phones with images of stars on display.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nAs Chief, Alex decided to initiate a weekly free breakfast for the interns in the cafeteria. At the same time, a gallery with pictures of all past and present Chiefs was installed there. Jo made him pose next to his photo and sent a picture to [[Helen Karev]] to show her how far her son had come. Bailey found herself bugged by Alex's picture on there and reminded him of the time he wanted to step down but she still needed time. Now, she felt ready to return. However, Alex told her he had gotten good at the job and that he wanted to keep the job till the end of the six-month contract they had agreed to. Begrudgingly, she told him she was proud of him for standing up for himself.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith was breaking her longest surgery record, Alex had to navigate a flood of overdose patients. He and Jo treated a woman who lost her kid in the chaos at the park where the overdoses originated, only to later discover that she had taken her kid to the park so she could score some drugs. Reminding him of the time his father left him in a parking lot when he was six, Alex had a strong reaction to the situation and told the kid's father to do whatever he needed to to protect his son, even if it meant keeping him away from his mother. Jo later brought Alex a cup of hot chocolate to comfort him and he told her he loved her.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex is surprised by his mother's visit.]]\nOn the day of Catherine's party, Meredith told Alex about her and Andrew dating. After mocking her a bit, as a friend, he was happy for her, and as Chief, he told her to inform HR. He then got ready to leave. Taryn came in to tell him that \"Mrs. Karev\" wanted to see it. He thought she was talking about Jo and told her to tell Jo to meet him at the party. Alex was the first to arrive at the party and indulged in appetizers and ping-pong while mocking Jackson about his ridiculously huge and luxurious penthouse. Having ignored his phone, Alex was surprised when Jo showed up at the party with his mother, who claimed she just came by for a visit. While he and Jo discussed their suspicion of a psychotic break and planned to her back to their loft, Helen disappeared into the crowd. They eventually found her and Helen showed Alex a bag of scarfs she had knitted as a wedding present. He picked the green one as it was his favorite color as a child.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex introduces Helen to Meredith.]]\nHe then tried to reach his mom's doctor, but he couldn't reach them. He hated that a mere visit could be a sign of a split from reality. Now that she was doing fine, he didn't know what the warning signs were anymore, unlike in his childhood. He and Jo watched Helen knit and decided to wait until tomorrow to find out what was going on. He later went to tell her that her visit threw him, but it meant a lot to him. Helen was the first to detect the smell of smoke. Alex thought it was another sign and tried to keep her calm while she urged everyone to get out, disturbing the celebratory toast. However, she turned out to be right and they evacuated the penthouse with the other characters. Out on the street, Alex introduced his mother to Meredith, who confirmed she and Alex were each other's best friend. Alex and Jo then took Helen home and helped her get settled on their couch. Despite her being right about the fire, they still were not convinced she was okay.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex has doubts about approving Vincenzo's research.]]\nJo and Alex took Helen with them to the hospital to show her around. She had been knitting baby hats ever since Alex told her they wanted kids. Before heading into back-to-back meetings, he asked Bailey to cover the ER. She commented she was counting down the  days before she could stop taking orders from him. His first meeting was with [[Vincenzo DeLuca]], Andrew, and Carina. Vincenzo wanted to start research about gestational sacks. Seeing potential, Alex asked for two days to consider, although he was inclined to say. However, Meredith warned him to dig into Vincenzo's past, though she kept his mental illness a secret so as to not break Andrew's trust.\n\nAlex took Helen to a park for lunch. He hated that he didn't come up with Vincenzo's idea of his own. They talked about his childhood. As a -year-old, he once asked her what the inside of a doorknob looked like. She took one apart to show and he wouldn't let her put it back together until he one day did it himself. So, she thought he would be an engineer. He said he was more of a fixer than an innovator, but she disagreed. She had always been in awe of his brain. Alex then brought up the baby hats that freaked out Jo. Helen says she only meant to give Jo a little nudge. Carina eventually informed Alex about her father's mental illness. He didn't want to say no because of that given his experience with his mother, so he approved to provide funding for the research. Later, Jo told him she freaked out not because of him but because she didn't know anything about her genome and her biological parents' medical history, so she decided to have her genome examined.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Alex was hopeful about the DeLuca research, Bailey thought he had stared a moral slippery slope that she would have to handle soon. When a lamb died in one of the sacks, Carina thought it best to remove her father, who downplayed the death, from the research as it as too important to let it be screwed up by him, but Andrew disagreed. After a talk with Helen, Bailey came to tell Alex that Helen had been sticking around longer than planned because she was too scared to go home by herself and she didn't dare to ask for help. Teddy then paged Alex to tell him Vincenzo had pitched his research to help out a pregnant couple at risk of losing their baby. Alex, Carina, and Teddy had to deliver the news to the hopeful parents that they could not approve that procedure on humans yet and instead had to deliver the baby while doing the hysterectomy so it could pass away in its father's arms. Alex then called the DeLucas into his office and told them Vincenzo's major breach of protocol and reckless behavior had convinced him to stop the research. Furious, Vincenzo took his research back to Italy. While attending a fish fry hosted by Richard on the roof, Alex asked Bailey to cover for him while he flew back to Iowa with his mother. He and Helen said goodbye to Jo and left for the airport.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\n\nJo decided to seek out her biological family in Pittsburgh. Once she got there, she stopped answering his calls, worrying him. He spent the day working with Andrew, who was shutting Meredith out ever since the failed research project with his father. They were to perform a total pancreatectomy. Andrew thought Meredith had asked Alex to put him on the case to cheer him up and said he didn't need any favors. The patient, [[Nora Hillridge]], was sabotaging her own surgery by drinking juice to increase her glycemia so that she could stay in the hospital and wouldn't have to go back to school. The doctors found out and Andrew went a bit overboard in his attempts to convince Nora's mother to make her daughter get the surgery. Alex then threw Andrew off the case, but Andrew went to talk to Nora behind his back and convinced her to consent to the surgery by talking about how he overcame being bullied. Alex then performed the surgery behind Andrew's back to punish him for not obeying his orders. Andrew later confronted him about that move and Alex told him that he was letting the stuff with his father interfere with his job and relationship. He told Andrew not to bite people's hand when they reach out because then they stop reaching out. Alex then went home and found Jo in bed. He told her he missed her and got ready for bed, not noticing in the dark that she was crying and only pretending to be asleep.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nShe didn't talk to him about what had happened and started to avoid him, leaving for work while he was in the shower. It was his last day of Chief and he confronted her about not telling him what happened, but she gave some vague answer about needing Bailey for a fellowship grant and left. At the end of the day, he asked her to go out to celebrate his no longer being Chief, but she wanted to crawl into bed after the rough day she had. He wanted to join, but she needed to be alone and told him to go celebrate with Meredith. He once again told her she could tell him anything as he wouldn't judge given his own family history. She firmly stated she did not want and could not talk about it. She then went home by herself.<ref>[[Silent All These Years]], x</ref>\n\nFor a week, Jo pretended to be sick and did not go back to work. He knew she was lying, but she continued to completely shut him out and lie in bed all day. He went to work in a suit, something he had grown to like as Chief. Bailey paged him to ask about the compliance reports due tomorrow, but he had no idea what she was talking about. Alex took the case of [[Gus Carter]], a kid with autism that the doctors had to communicate with through LEGO blocks. Alex then reached out to Link to find out if he knew anything, but Link didn't even know she had looked up her birth mother. Alex then asked him to go over to his loft and distract her. The doctors diagnosed Gus with a thymoma, which was compromising his immune system, but they couldn't operate until they had transfused him to cure his anemia. However, the transfusion went badly and they discovered he had the extremely rare Rh blood type, meaning he could only receive blood from the exact same type. That meant that they had to put off the surgery until they found a match. Alex then received a text from Link. He rushed to the loft and found Jo laughing hysterically at a cartoon. Alex thought she was doing better, but Link told her she was in a rough shape, unlike anything he'd ever seen before. He was sure she needed help, but he did not know how to do that.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nAlex managed to get Jo to agree to come back to work. He urged all of his colleagues not to make a big deal out of it. Meredith found him and told him she tried with [[Cristina Yang]] and [[Marie Cerone]] if they could help out for Gus's blood, but to no avail. Alex then told her Jo still wasn't talking. He was afraid Jo had finally broken and would leave him, like all his previous lovers had done. Meredith assured him that she wouldn't. She just wasn't ready to talk yet. Later, he heard she came to work drunk and confronted her about it at home. Angrily, he told her he was done being told to leave her alone if he loved her and he threatened to go to Pittsburgh himself to find out what had happened. She told him she would talk when she was ready to and that she'd leave him if he threatened to go Pittsburgh ever again. They then made a deal that he would report her to Bailey if she came to work drunk again, so she promised she wouldn't.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nJo was assigned to monitor Gus while Alex and Meredith took on the case of [[Gabriella Rivera]], a kid with an obstruction that required surgery. Gabriella's father was an immigrant cleaning offices for a living and he made too much money to qualify for state coverage for the surgery, which was too expensive for Luis to pay. Meredith then put Ellis's name down on the paperwork. Before they headed into surgery, Jo found Alex and told him she had found a donor for Gus. He called her a good luck charm and gave her instructions to prepare Gus for surgery. After Gabriella's surgery, during which they found cancer, Alex found Jo sobbing in [[Lori Carter|Lori Carter's]] arms. Alex took Jo away and found out she had mistaken a phone call from someone calling to see if Gus could donate blood as someone responding to their needing a donor. Alex met with Bailey in her office and vented his despair over the situation, not knowing what to do with Jo.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAlex then made arrangements with Meredith so that she could stay at the loft to get through to Jo while he helped out Amelia and Maggie with her kids. They finally found a donor for Gus from London. Alex sent Levi to go pick up the donor, who was severely agoraphobic, at the airport. However, when her therapist was arrested by customs for a problem with his visa, [[Frances Pinfield]] fled back onto the plane and refused to leave. Alex then sent Owen to help Levi out. Gus's parents grew frustrated while waiting. In between, Alex checked in on Gabby, who was doing well and spending time Andrew. Soon after, Gus had a heart attack and they managed to pull him through, but the need for transfusion only increased. While in the room, Owen FaceTimed Alex so Frances could meet Gus and his parents to convince her to get off the plane. That worked, but the car got stuck on the highway due to fog covering the city. With Gus's number rapidly worsening to the point of impending organ failure, Alex decided to took Gus to the hyperbaric chamber to guarantee maximum oxygen. Meredith, having reached a breakthrough with Jo, joined him in the chamber so they could talk.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith informs Alex on what has been going on with Jo.]]\nMeredith told him that Jo was the product of rape and that she had been told she looked just like her father, which sent her into a depression. Meredith had convinced her to get a proper leave of absence so she could ge the help she needed. The news made Alex think about the day she left for Pittsburgh. He was worried about what she'd find, but she told him that the worst that could happen was that her mother did not want to see her and then she'd just come home to him and at least she'd know. He thought he should have stopped her, but Meredith told him he couldn't have. She also told him he had tried to help her as best as he could, but she needed professional help. While in there, they were informed that the insurance company had found out about Meredith's insurance fraud and that Andrew was taking the fall for her. Meredith couldn't stop him since she was stuck in the chamber, where Gus started coding again. Alex started CPR and started to lose it, saying Jo had disappeared and now Meredith would be going to jail, leaving him all alone. Meredith told him he wasn't alone yet and took over. They pulled Gus through and Jo arrived with the blood right when the chamber was decompressed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex is fired along with Richard and Meredith for covering up the latter's insurance fraud.]]\nWhile Meredith took Gus away, Jo finally told Alex that she was not okay. She knew how to rise when she had to, but she needed help. Alex promised her they would figure it out. Richard then came to get Alex for Meredith's problems. The two of them went to back her in the meeting with Bailey and Catherine, which led to all three of them being fired by Bailey. Afterwards, Alex went to make sure Gus was fine, and then took Jo to the in-patient psychiatry ward. He said goodbye to her with a kiss and watched her check herself in. Bailey stood by him and as they left, he asked if he was really fired. She said it hurt her more than it did him.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAfter dropping Jo off at the psychiatric department, Alex went out for drinks with Link to inform him about Jo. Alex confessed he was scared that the treatment wouldn't work, as it had failed to help many other people in his life with psychiatric problems. Link told him Jo was a fighter and that she would come out stronger. However, when she did come out a week later, they decided to commit her to a -day program at a psychiatric facility. Alex dropped her off. Before heading in, she said she didn't want to be another name on his list of crazy people. He was convinced she would come out fine, but she reminded him that they weren't legally married and that she would understand if he were to take that out. He didn't reply and she headed into the facility.\n\nTwo weeks later, they met with Jo's doctor present. She told him that when he tried to talk to her in her depressive episode, she felt fear, shame, and pain. She was ashamed that she was unable to receive the love that he was giving her. She pushed him away and feared that she would never be able to regain his trust. Alex admitted he was scared, too. She knew he had had enough crazy for a lifetime and that he deserved more than someone weak who breaks like glass. The doctor said she was actually stronger than most for coming to the facility, but Alex didn't answer.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n\nA week later, Richard came by for a visit and noticed that Alex's life had fallen apart with Jo gone. He suggested Alex apply for the Chief of Surgery job at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] so he could hire him. Alex was hesitant, but Richard pointed out his life was a mess and that he needed to give Jo a reason to come back home. Alex then gathered himself and applied for the job, which he got. He then went to pick up Jo at the facility. He got down on knee and admitted he had thought about leaving because he was scared, but he had realized he was stronger with her by his side. He didn't care that she wasn't magically cured and proposed to her again, which she accepted.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOn Jo's first day back to work, Alex offered Jo a job at Pac-North so she could start with a clean slate, even allowing her to run her own fellowship. On Richard's first day at Pac-North as director of the general surgery program, he came to complain to Alex about the two only residents being terrible and to demand an office. Alex reminded him of the hospital's terrible rankings and the need to turn the place around. While the hospital's CT was down, the ER was flooded, including patients from Meredith's work crew. He called her to tell her to stop doing that and then checked in with Jo, who told him that Bailey made her the exact same offer as him. He then countered with an offer to make her general surgeon as he needed the extra hands. Alex was pulled onto an emergent case with Richard of a man who nearly died in the ER's waiting room. During surgery, Richard talked about missing working at Grey Sloan as he had imagined himself dropping dead one day in OR , which made him happy. They managed to save the patient. Afterwards, Alex told Richard that he had dreaded working at Pac-North, too, given the legacy he inherited at Grey Sloan from Bailey and Richard himself. However, he was convinced that they would be able to turn this place around so that failure was no longer the culture there and made Richard see that it could provide him with a new legacy other than dropping dead in Grey Sloan's OR. He came home to Jo, who told him she had used his offer to demand the attending position at Grey Sloan. Alex understood it was the better move for her and congratulated her.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nTogether, they started turning the place around. Alex arranged a new MRI machine for the hospital but they had to wait for the right software in order to be able to use it. A tough situation arose for Alex when Richard accidentally took a misidentified patient off of life support.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref> Alex was amused when Meredith's article came out, inadvertently trashing Grey Sloan specifically instead of the medical system itself. With the basics at Pac-North set straight, Alex and Richard started teaching the two residents at the hospital. He ran into Owen, who delivered a patient who had refused to be treated at Grey Sloan because of the article, and offered to give him a tour after learning he had taken up paternity leave to avoid having to work under [[Tom Koracick]]. During their tour, they came across a woman shouting for help from the ICU as one of the residents failed to deliver adequate help to her hemorrhaging husband. Alex and Owen jumped in and took the man to the OR, where they talked about the situation at Grey Sloan. Alex acknowledged that Bailey, like everyone else there, didn't deserve to work under Tom and inquired if Owen was tired of sitting at home yet. Alex then offered him the position of Head of Trauma Surgery, allowing him to structure the department as he saw fit. Owen accepted the position.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOne day after work, Alex came home and learned Jo had had a rough day. She didn't want to talk about it. He didn't want her to keep it inside like before. Instead, she started to throw toys at the wall to calm herself down, which she had learned worked for her while being treated for her depressive episode. She invited Alex to join her and he admitted it felt satisfying.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Jo tried to scare Alex while he was getting ready for work but he was too occupied with his meeting with investors that day. Alex and Richard led the group around the hospital. To distract them from a chaotic ER, Alex wanted to take them to the construction site of the new research wing, which was on budget and ahead of schedule, but a construction worker came to get him for something he had to see first. Alex left the group in Richard's hands and went with the worker, who showed him they had come across skeletal remains while digging. They discovered it was a mass grave, a remnant of the hospital's past as a psychiatric facility, and decided to stop construction. Alex informed Richard, who took it upon himself to keep the investors busy while Alex handled the administrative load. Jo showed up with fake blood in another attempt to scare Alex but he was informed that multiple patients were crashing in the ICU. Jo suggested the hospital was haunted, which started a rumor amongst the nurses. Alex and Owen traced the source of the problem back to a broken fridge in the ICU's blood supply. He issued an order to only use Central Blood Supply from that point forward. Afterwards, Alex overheard the gossip and loudly announced the authorities had been informed about the mass grave while assuring everyone the hospital was not haunted. His announcement came right when Richard walked in the with the investors. Alex took the investors to his office and explained the situation properly. They were impressed with his ability to handle chaos and approved more funding. Jo dropped by his office and he wanted to celebrate the good news with her. He thought it was a good time to get legally married and they went to the courthouse. During her vows, she finally managed to scare him by claiming she was pregnant. She set the record straight and the ceremony continued.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, Maggie arrived at Pac-North with Richard's brother and niece, who needed surgery to remove a myxoma. Alex granted Maggie privileges so she could perform the surgery there and introduced her the stuff, expressing his hopes that she might decide to come work there, which had worked before. Maggie lost the patient and panicked as she had convinced the family to let her operate against their initial wishes. Alex comforted her and let her vent her feelings before they went to inform Richard and his brother together.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nAlex took the day off for Meredith's hearing before the medical commission and was one of the few people to follow the entire hearing. He testified that Meredith made him a better surgeon and person. When the prosecutor brought up the delay in Zola's adoption, Alex refrained from mentioning her kidnapping but the prosecutor pressed him and asked if it had anything to do with her brief firing at the time. Alex hesitated and wondered why Meredith's family was relevant to the hearing. [[Paul Castello]] pointed out she seemed pretty cavalier about the law in both her professional and personal life. Meredith then saved Alex from having to answer by lashing out at Paul, the man who had killed Derek, for not remembering her and thus not having the right to judge her. Paul then had a seizure and was taken away. The judge wanted to postpone the hearing but Alex loudly objected. He had brought together a whole group of people who had been treated by Meredith and had all come from all over the country to testify on her behalf. He had also gathered letters of support from Cristina, Addison, April, Callie, and Arizona. He read Cristina's out loud and offered to keep going but the judge had heard enough. The panel voted to dismiss the entire case, meaning Meredith would get to keep her license. Alex congratulated Meredith with the rest of the staff who had come out to support her.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nShortly afterwards, Alex\uatraveled to Iowa to visit his mother.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref> He remained in Iowa for a while and worked out a deal for Richard to hire Maggie at Pac-North from there.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref><ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref>\n[[File:xAlexMeetsKids.png|thumb|Alex meets his kids.]]\nHe started to ignore Jo and Meredith's calls and texts, which prompted Jo to call\uaAlex's mother, who revealed that Alex had never been in Iowa. Soon afterwards, Meredith, Jo, Bailey, and Richard all received letters from Alex, who explained that he had reconciled with Izzie during Meredith's trial. He said that he felt like him and Izzie were \"frozen in time\" and that they felt unfinished. He also\uafound out that she gave birth to his kids with the embryos they froze years ago due to the cancer having nuked her eggs. Alex said that he was staying with Izzie and their two children (Alexis and Eli)\uain Kansas and wouldn't be coming back to Seattle, because he wanted\uato ensure his kids\uadidn't grow up like he did, without a father, along with the fact that he loved Izzie.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\n\nDespite the callous image he projects, Alex is particularly affected when he treats addicts and abused children because of his childhood background. He initially refused to install a central line for a Demerol addict because he did not want to feed his habit. He was also able to connect with a teenage boy whose abusive father hit his mother.<ref>[[Enough is Enough]], x</ref>\n\nHe hides his pain behind a mask of aggression and bad attitude. For a while, he pushed everyone away, but since going into peds, he's showed more of who he really is. After Cristina left, he acted as Meredith's person, which shows a different side of his personality, which shows him as sweet, caring, and compassionate.\n\n\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nIzzie realized that Alex was not as insensitive and cruel as he portrayed himself to be. She began a tentative friendship with him, to the shock of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], and [[George O'Malley|George]]. Later, Meredith's opinion of Alex changed for the better when he offered to listen to her problems with her mother, [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]].\n\nWhen Alex found out that Izzie was an ex-lingerie model, he obtained a copy of her advertisement and proceeded to paste copies all over Seattle Grace. Although he succeeded in humiliating her, she turned things on him by stripping to her underwear in front of him and several other interns, reminding him that her modeling is the reason why she is debt-free while he is \ucsitting on two hundred grand of student loans\ud.\n\nAlex eventually asked Izzie out on a date. However on that very day, he found out from the Chief that he failed his medical board exams. This caused him to suffer from a crisis of confidence, leading him to treat her shabbily during their date. His confidence took another blow when he froze up during a makeshift emergency surgery in an elevator during a power outage, and George had to operate on the patient himself. Izzie, still furious from the horrendous date, refused to speak to him. Afterwards, in Joe's bar, he went up to her and kissed her, rekindling their budding relationship. However, their sex life hit a bump when Alex had difficulties performing. Meanwhile, his confidence in his medical skills further deteriorated after he accidentally administered a wrong dosage saline solution, paralyzing the patient. In a moment of vulnerability, he slept with Olivia and was caught in the act by Izzie, effectively ending their relationship.\n\nIzzie subsequently found out about it and blew up at her friends for helping Alex. She eventually forgave him but ruled out getting back together with him. Alex passed his re-test and became a full-fledged doctor. During the code black, the dire situation of a bomb scare caused Izzie to realize that she should act on her feelings. She accosted Alex and the two proceeded to have sex in a linen closet. They continued to sleep together several times over the course of the day.\n\nIzzie's patient, Denny Duquette, was re-admitted after he suffered a heart failure. Alex was jealous of Izzie's concern for Denny, and tried to get Denny to back off by telling him that he was with Izzie and there is a good chance that he would die from his failing heart anyway. She confronted him, and he told her that she cannot get involved with her patients. However, Izzie realized that she didn't have to settle for Alex. Offended when Alex referred to the still-living Denny as a \"corpse\", she dumped him saying, \"Just so we're clear, we're over. On your very best day, that 'corpse' is twice the man you will ever be. You're not good enough for me, Alex. You're not good enough for anyone.\"\n\nWhen Denny died from a stroke, Alex picked up a devastated Izzie and told her that the dead man was no longer Denny, the man she once loved. Alex realized that his feelings for Izzie had not diminished since she dumped him, and impulsively kissed her in the stairwell. Izzie had yet to get over Denny and told him she cannot commit in a relationship with him just yet, and he understood. However, Alex claimed his lack of interest in Izzie and has appeared to have gotten over her.\n\nHis feelings for Izzie eventually came back and when she gave him an ultimatum (to pick between the nice Alex and the jerk Alex) he chooses nice and they begin to go out again. He starts dating Izzie exclusively and after winning his solo-surgery he tells her he loves her.\n\nFollowing the revelation of her cancer, Alex ''[[Snooching|snooches]]'' in a cup as they harvest Izzie's eggs in case they ever want a child. When Izzie is discovered to have an inoperable tumor, Meredith and Derek gave their wedding to Alex and Izzie and the two marry.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Alex and Izzie get married.]]\n\nAfter the death of [[George O'Malley]], and the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]], Izzie was fired partly because Alex told Chief Webber she couldn't handle the pressure of working because she was still recovering. He meant to protect her but Izzie didn't think so and she left Seattle, leaving Alex with unpaid medical bills and no ideas of where she was.\n\nAlex remained worried for weeks trying to join her because she had to treat her cancer and she didn't show up to her round of chemo. When she finally got back, to get some help for an old teacher, they didn't manage to work their problems out and Izzie left once again.\n\nIzzie eventually sent Alex divorce papers, and while Alex signed them and had committed to Lexie, Alex still loved her. He called out for Izzie while he was delirious after getting shot. Alex, thinking Lexie was Izzie, expressed his glee that she returned and begged her to stay with him.\n\nOver time, he started dating other girls and his love for Izzie faded. A couple of years after Izzie's departure, Alex entered a committed relationship with Jo Wilson. When a patient showed up that reminded Alex of Izzie, Jo told him to call Izzie to find out how she was doing. He stated he didn't need to, as he had made up a new life for\ualzzie in his head, in which she was married and working as a surgeon. He preferred not to call her and instead held onto\uathat imagined life for her, in which she's always smiling as she's as happy with her husband as Alex is with Jo.\n\nBefore Meredith's medical trial, Alex called Izzie to see if she would help out, and during the conversation, he found out she had given birth to twins and he was the father as a result of the frozen embyos. He decided to go meet them, which reignited his romance with Izzie. They are currently raising their son and daughter together in Kansas.\n\n[[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia Harper]]\n[[File:xAlexandOlivia.png|thumb|xpx|Izzie finds Alex cheating on her with Olivia]]\nGeorge contracted [[Medical Glossary#S|syphilis]] from Alex through [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]]. It was revealed that Olivia was already dating Alex when George asked her out. Olivia subsequently broke up with Alex after realizing how much she liked George. Furious at the revelation that Alex was the cause of his syphilis, George punched Alex in the face. That night, [[Joe]], the owner of [[Emerald City Bar]] was admitted to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], and in discussions with Joe, it was revealed that Alex was a regular at Joe's bar every night and that he and Joe had become close friends. When George finds a way to pay for Joe's hospital bills, the animosity between George and Alex is dissolved after Alex gives George a hug.\n\nA mixer was held for the new interns, and it was at this mixer that he met and presumably hit it off with Nurse Olivia Harper, as he is shown leaving the event with an arm around her.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nAddison discovered Alex's better side and found herself attracted to him. To some degree, Alex was also attracted to Addison as they subsequently shared frequent meaningful looks. This culminated in an actual kiss in Joe's bar. Later, during the -day trial with [[Mark Sloan]], Addison sleeps with Alex, breaking the deal. However, he later told her that he only wants to work with her professionally, and is not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her. It was his work with her that led Alex to no longer pursue [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]] as a [[Specialties|specialty]] but spark an interest in [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]].\n\n[[Rebecca Pope]]\nDuring a ferry accident, Alex found a severely injured pregnant woman crushed under a pylon. He rescued her from the debris and encouraged her to stay alive. The pregnant Jane Doe subsequently became hysterical after realizing she could not remember anything, and turned to Alex for support, thinking that he was her husband. Alex showed much concern for her and constantly checked on her progress, bonding with her in the process. He also helped her pick out a new face for reconstruction, as well as a new name \"Ava\". As Alex spent more time with Ava, he became increasingly attached to her, spending most of his time checking on her progress and doing research. This led Addison to accuse him of being too emotionally involved with a patient, but he countered saying that he was just being prepared. In the heat of the argument, Addison kissed him and pushed him into an on-call room, where the two had sex. However, Alex rebuffed Addison's subsequent advances, after learning she wanted a committed man to have kids with, something which he was not ready for.\n\nAfter Addison left, Ava returned\uaa couple times and they slept together. The last time she came, she told him that she was pregnant, which caused\uaAlex to ask whether she was keeping it. After that, he became more sensitive and had\uaher move in. After a couple days, Izzie confronted\uaAlex and rold him that Ava was not really pregnant and never was. Alex refused\uato believe it and so did Ava. Izzie showed\uahim the charts though, and he couldn't dispute that, so he told Ava, and she thought she had a miscarriage even though he told her there was no baby. She couldn't take care of herself and so he did everything for her, insisting that she was\uafine. Finally, she cut herself and Izzie admitted\uaher and forced\uaher to get a psych consult. Alex called\uaher husband, who told him that he left Ava and went with the child. He also said\uathat she'd already been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. She was taken to a psychiatric ward and Alex was forced to move on.\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\nAlex decided to not wait for her and he slept with [[Lexie Grey]] just before Izzie came back home. She tried to convince him that they could start over but he had moved on and he decided to break up with Izzie. So Izzie left Seattle for apparently the last time, telling she couldn't stand it.\n\nLater, she sent the divorce paper to Alex, with her name signed on it. Alex then signed his name, kissed Lexie and they walked out of the hospital, hand-in-hand.\n\nAlex was shot in the hospital by a grieving deceased patient's husband, but survived with the help of Lexie and Mark. While undergoing treatment, he mistook Lexie for Izzie. He apologized to her and continued by telling her \"[she] came back\" and tearfully begging her never to leave him again; Lexie, declining to correct him, assured him that she never would. Following the shooting, Lexie had a mental breakdown in front of Alex. Mark asked Alex to help her but he refused and walks away. He returned to being very promiscuous and refused to have the bullet in his chest removed, saying that it was his \"war wound.\" After insulting Lexie, she cut him down to size, stating that he was not \"badass\" for living because she was the reason that he survived and that while he was dying, he cried out for the wife who left him, that is, Izzie. Alex is left speechless.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nAlex and Callie slept together after a big surgery involving reconstruction of a man's legs was successful. No one knew at the time, but the relationship was later revealed when Callie gave her speech on Lecture Day.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n\n[[Lucy Fields]]\nAlex had a brief romantic relationship with the attending OB/GYN Lucy Fields. At first, Lucy strongly disliked Alex after he called her patient a turnip, but after discovering they shared an equal enthusiasm for college basketball, she liked him slightly more. Eventually, they began a romantic and sexual relationship.\ua[[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]]\uaoffered Alex the proposal to go to Africa to tend to and check up on the patients who visited and received medical attention at Seattle Grace. Lucy was disappointed because as Alex was considering that opportunity, he didn't even think about Lucy. She shook it off by saying it didn't matter what she thought. Arizona approached Alex and asks him if he wasn't taking the job because of Lucy, as she didn't want him to do the same thing she did and run back to Lucy once in Africa. Alex told Lucy he was not taking the job in Africa because she was \"a factor.\" She told him to stop and said he was right when he said career comes first. She told him she took the job -- not at Baylor, but Alex's proposed job in Africa. She assured him it wasn't personal. Not long after that, she walked into Joe's and said to Alex, \"tell me not to go to Africa.\" He told her to go to hell.\n\nInterns\nWhile still planning to go to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], Alex was known as a \"player\" amongst the new interns and also as the attending who sleeps around with all of the interns because he didn't plan to stay at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nOne of the interns, [[Jo Wilson]], started up a close friendship with Alex. They bonded at Bailey's wedding as they talked about their hard upbringings. They saw\uaeach other as just friends. However, after some time, Alex began\uato see Jo in a different way. This was seen when he got\uajealous of her going on a date with an OB/GYN resident, [[Jason Myers]]. Jo and Alex began to separate as she and Jason became a couple and Alex tried to avoid his feelings for her. After Alex told Jason about Jo's past, Jo yelled at Alex and told him that she shouldn't have trusted him. Alex admitted his love for her to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] not long after that.\n\nThe two avoided each other almost entirely after their fight. One night, Alex witnesses Jo and Jason fighting. Not long after, she shows up at his doorstep and he begins to argue with her for being unavoidable. She turns her face toward him and it's clear that she has been hit by Jason. Alex takes her up to his bed and tucks her in.\n\n[[Perfect Storm|During the superstorm]], he finally admitted\uato Jo that he loves her and the couple shared\uaa kiss.\n\nAfter that, they began dating. They hit a bit of a rocky patch when Alex's dad came into the hospital from a car crash related to drugs. Alex asked Jo to do a paternity test, and he said he didn't want to know at the same time she said, \"he's your father.\" Alex then proceeded to stalk his father at bars where he was performing. When Alex didn't come home for  nights in a row,\uaJo got worried. He then told her what was happening and they worked it out.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Alex proposes marriage to Jo.]]\n\nAfter his dad returned to the hospital trying to get clean, Alex said goodbye for a final time. At [[April Kepner|April's]] wedding, Alex proposed to Jo, without actually saying that he wanted to marry her. When Jo realized that he proposed to her, she declined. However, they stayed together. Although Jo didn't accept Alex's proposal, he still knows that he will eventually marry her.\n\nAlex proposed to Jo for the second time two years later. At the same time, Jo was trying to dump Alex for spending too much time with Meredith. Alex asked Meredith to keep Jo's ring until the day he would propose to her. Jo unfortunately didn't know that Meredith was only trying to pass Jo's ring to Alex without her seeing.\n\nAfter Jo not answering the proposal, they broke up and after spending some time apart, they got back together. The unanswered proposal caused some strain on their relationship. She eventually told Alex that she didn't want the ring yet, but she also didn't want it gone and that he should keep in in the drawer.\n\nAfter a few months, Alex asked Jo if they would ever get married. He said it didn't have to be today or tomorrow but he wanted to know that it would happen. She said she couldn't, but Alex was adamant that she could. She said no.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref>\ua\n\nThey fought. She said she loved him and that they should make a baby, but he wanted to get married. He wanted to know why and as she went to tell him, he cut her off and stormed out. Later, she told Andrew the reason why she couldn't marry Alex was because she was already married to an abusive man and feared if she filed for divorce, he would find her. Alex didn't know this because she worried about him going after her abusive ex. Alex walked into the loft and found Jo giggling while half-naked and DeLuca on top of her in bed. He jumped to the wrong conclusion and began to punch him.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Alex told Jo that he'd found her husband and gone to see him, Jo locked the door and started kissing him, surprised that he'd seen her husband without killing him, which proved to her that Alex wasn't a violent guy.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\uaThey got back together and eventually got engaged. Their wedding ceremony was held on a ferryboat and was officiated by Meredith.\n\nAfter Jo visited her birth mom and entered a depressive episode, Alex stayed by her side and helped her recover. Jo felt bad for being another one of his crazy women and offered him an out, but instead, later on,\uaAlex proposed to her again. Jo accepted.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\uaThe two got married on Halloween.\n\nAfter Meredith's trial, Alex supposedly went to Iowa to tend to his sick mother, but after failing to return Jo's calls, she found out from his mom that he was never in Iowa. A few days later, Jo received a letter from him, saying he was living in Kansas with Izzie and their two kids. He explained that it felt like him and Izzie were \"frozen in time\" which caused him to want to stay with her.\uaHe said he loved Jo, and he meant it when he wanted to marry her, and also told her she would find a better man than him. He also sent her divorce papers.\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nInitially, Meredith disliked Alex. Meredith thought that Alex was a bad person, who just had sex with everyone in the hospital. He was not nice to anyone, especially fellow intern and Meredith's close friend\ua[[George O'Malley]]. Eventually,\ua[[Izzie Stevens]]\uabefriended Alex and Meredith accepted him as well. They maintained a close friendship throughout the years and Alex even made Meredith his best man at his wedding to Izzie.\ua\n[[File:x-.jpg|left|thumb|xpx|Meredith and Alex talk about Derek]]\nWhen Izzie left the hospital after being fired, Meredith became a source of support for Alex. They maintained a very close friendship until Alex informed\ua[[Owen Hunt]]\uain a drunken state\uaof Meredith's tampering with the Alzheimer's trial. Meredith became furious with Alex, especially since this led to Zola being taken away. Alex worked hard for Meredith's forgiveness, however, and even went to the judge responsible for Zola's adoption case. He apologized to Meredith lots of times but she refused to forgive him at first. When [[Cristina Yang]] got Alex to get up and help Meredith to keep Zola, after yelling at him, he replied with, \"I don't have anyone! You guys are all I have! You're supposed to have my back! You have to forgive me!\" With his help, Meredith and\ua[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]\uagot Zola back. Since this, Meredith and Alex have recovered and maintain a close friendship. Alex also bought\ua[[Meredith's House|Meredith's house]]\uafrom her after he chose to remain in [[Seattle]].\n\nMeredith even went so far to help Alex come up with a lie to tell the police since his hand was bruised from attacking Andrew DeLuca, and she helped him calm down.\n\nThere has never been any sexual attraction between Alex and Meredith. When they lived together, Meredith would often sit in the bathroom while Alex showered and vent to him as they have a brother/sister relationship.\n\nWith Cristina's departure, Alex has become Meredith's new \"person\".\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nCristina and Alex have a love-hate relationship as they often make fun of each other but no matter what Alex, Cristina, and Meredith are there for each other. They are from the same intern class, so naturally, they are close as they have spent so many years together.\n\nWhen Alex buys Meredith's house, Cristina moves in.\n\nCristina told Alex on her last day in Seattle that she was surprised by how good he became as a surgeon. This was one of the very few compliments Alex has ever gotten from her. She also told Meredith that Alex needs to be mocked at least once a day or he'll be insufferable.\n\nAfter Cristina left Seattle for Z\ufcrich, Alex found an envelope in his bed that informed him that Cristina had left her shares of the hospital to him.\n\n[[Morgan Peterson]]\nMorgan was a surgical intern at Seattle Grace Mercy West. She was Alex's intern and was helping him study to pass his boards when she passed out. She had heart complications and needed an emergency c-section. She had a boyfriend, Chris, who worked at the [[Cleveland Clinic]]. The baby was born at  weeks, and Chris left a little while after the baby was born because he thought the baby was going to die and that it was pointless because the pregnancy was accidental anyway. Morgan decided to call the baby Tommy after her father. Alex was very attached to Tommy. Alex and Morgan got close, but Arizona scared Alex off of Morgan by telling Alex that Morgan was into him. Alex avoided her and Tommy for weeks. Alex tried to get back into the case later. He almost missed his flight to San Francisco to take his boards because he was taking care of Tommy. He then flew back to Seattle the night before his boards to take care of Tommy and helped Morgan when Tommy died.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nEver since the start of their internship, Alex has disliked George. On their first day as interns, George was given the name  (when he froze in his first surgery) by Alex and it was the start of their mutual dislike for each other. Later on, George learned that he had contracted syphilis from his girlfriend Olivia. George was given the name \"Syph-boy\" by Cristina but soon learned that Alex was the person that gave syphilis to Olivia, which lead to Alex being punched by George. And on a different occasion, when Alex told George that Callie had slept with Mark Sloan, George went into denial and got into another fight with him.\n\nAlex repeatedly and frequently pointed out George's flaws - calling him weak and pathetic more than once - but Alex later revealed that he actually respected George and that if he were still alive then he would have beaten all the other residents at each milestone (st solo surgery, chief resident, etc.). Professionally, George had beaten Alex during important situations, even though Alex was better at poaching surgeries, George would have been better at dealing with emergency cases while Alex would just have frozen (e.g. heart in the elevator). Later, when George's mother returned, which brings back memories of George, Alex revealed to Cristina and Meredith that he didn't like to think of George because it reminded him of Izzie (his ex-wife) which brought pain.\n\nOver the years, Alex's views on George softened. When Meredith, Callie, and Alex were discussing all of the different doctors that lived in Meredith's house, George was brought up and Alex made a somber toast in his honor, showing that he truly did see him as a friend.\n\n\nDuring his intern year, Alex notably had a reputation for getting on the bad side of his attendings and other staff. and laissez-faire in dealing with patients, earning him the reprimand of Chief Webber. Dr. Shepherd once kicked him out of the O.R. for asking if their critically ill patient who had to be taken back for surgery could count as his second surgery and Dr. Hunt called him out several times for his lack of bedside manners.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nArizona is Alex's mentor and the two have maintained a close relationship because of that. Arizona is one of the only people who fully believes in Alex's surgical abilities. When Alex had decided to take the fellowship at Johns Hopkins, Arizona was hurt and upset. As a result of this, she decided to take Alex's spot on the [[Flight|plane]] that eventually crashed. As a result of this plane crash, Arizona lost her leg. At first, Alex worried that she blamed him as he was supposed to be in her spot. But this was not the case and Arizona and Alex continued to work well together.\n\nArizona also supported his decision to work for [[Oliver Lebackes]] and helped him after he ran into problems there.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nWhen acclaimed plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan took up a position at Seattle Grace, Alex leapt at the chance to pursue his interest in plastics. He wanted Addison to release him from her service, and she did. It becomes clear that Mark is a poor teacher, only delegating menial tasks to Alex. Alex gradually developed distaste for plastics after serving as Mark's intern, and found himself drawn back to Addison's surgeries.\n\nDuring the shooting, Mark, along with the help of Lexie, saved Alex's life after he was shot.\n\n\nAlex Karev is a former wrestler at [[University of Iowa]], and attended college on a wrestling scholarship.\n\nAlex prides himself on his honesty, which often lacks tact and can verge on being crude, brutal, and insensitive. This contributes to his poor bedside manner. However, Alex does have a moral code and is the only doctor who tells the truth to patients who make bad decisions about their health, at the risk of offending patients and getting kicked out of surgical cases.\n\nAlex is also the first intern to decide on his specialty \u [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgery]]. While it seemed at first that he chose that specialty due to \"frat-boy\" superficiality, the real reason was that plastic surgery patients \ucsign up for the pain they get\ud. He has unwittingly been drawn to [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|obstetrics and gynecology]] and [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]], after having several bad experiences in plastics, under Mark Sloan. Alex seems to have some talent in OB/GYN after serving as Addison's intern for a while.\n\nAlex Karev secured a position in the surgical residency program at Seattle Grace after graduating from medical school. Although first he was an intern of Jeremy, Alex was reassigned to a new resident [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]], to the disdain of the other interns under her. His frequent sexist remarks and overt come-ons made him even more disliked by the interns, who proceeded to dub him \ucevil spawn\ud. He became even more hated when he hijacked an open-heart surgery that rightfully belonged to the other interns. After which, he proceeded to taunt a furious Meredith, who attacked him in retaliation, calling him a \ucfrat boy bitch\ud.\n\nAlex confided in Meredith about his failed medical boards and she decided to help him study, roping in Cristina and George to help as well.\n\nAlex's streak of brutal honesty caused Addison to be on the receiving end of legal action, when he persuaded a patient's husband to sue the hospital for Addison's \ucmistake\ud in \ucBlue's for Sister Someone\ud. Furious, she informs a stunned Alex that he would be placed permanently under her service. Despite his lack of interest in obstetrics and gynecology, he has exhibited some flair for it as he managed to deliver a premature baby by himself.\n\nWhen acclaimed [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgeon]] Dr. [[Mark Sloan]] took up a position at Seattle Grace, Alex leapt at the chance to pursue his interest in plastics. He wanted Addison to release him from her service, and she did, but not before telling him that he would miss her. It becomes clear that Mark is a poor teacher, only delegating menial tasks to Alex. Alex gradually developed distaste for plastics after serving as Mark's intern, and found himself drawn back to Addison's surgeries. Addison left Seattle Grace and Alex found himself without any preferences for any specialty.\n\nWhen Rebecca Pope returned to Seattle Grace and revealed she was pregnant, Alex took up some shifts at the [[Emerald City Bar]].\n\nWhen Cristina was chosen to pick the first resident to perform a solo surgery, she chose Alex who performed a below the knee amputation.\n\nIt was during Alex's third year of residency that he heavily considered [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery]] as a specialty. Given his time as Addison's intern, and with Bailey's recommendation, [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Pediatric Surgery [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]] mentored Alex for the remainder of his residency; he officially declared his specialty during his fifth year, paving the way for his [[Fellow|fellowships]] after his residency.\n\nAlex was [[Owen Hunt|Owen's]] original choice for chief resident but after he sold out\ua[[Meredith Grey|Meredith]]\uawhen she tampered with the Alzheimer's trial,\ua[[Owen Hunt|Owen]]\uachose\ua[[April Kepner]]\uainstead.\n\nAlex passed his [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|oral boards]] and is a [[Board Certification|board certified surgeon]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|general surgery]] and completed a pediatric surgical fellowship at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] after turning down a fellowship at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]]. He then joined [[Lebackes Pediatric Surgery Clinic]], a private practice, as a new partner under practice director [[Oliver Lebackes|Dr. Oliver Lebackes]].\n\nWhen Cristina transferred her hospital shares to Alex, he considered sitting on the board of [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Unfortunately, the board unanimously voted for Bailey to take Cristina's seat, but hired Alex as an attending pediatric surgeon, especially as [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] needed to focus on her new fellowship in [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]].\n\nSometime after Robbins was promoted to the head of fetal surgery and Bailey was promoted to [[Chief of Surgery]], Alex was promoted to Robbins' old position as department head of pediatric surgery. Alex was then temporarily demoted to staff physician at the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]] when he was suspended. When his charges were dropped sometime later, Bailey reinstated Alex back to the surgical staff as the pediatric surgery head.\n\nAfter being fired by Bailey for his part in Meredith's insurance fraud, Alex was hired as Chief of Staff and Chief of Surgery at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]].\n\n\n*Alex Karev was not in the original pilot script. He wasn't added until after the pilot was shot. Therefore, scenes with him were either reshoots or digitally altered to include him.\n*His uncle is a rodeo cowboy.<ref>[[Superstition]], x</ref>\n*When discussing medical proxies, Alex told Cristina she could be his proxy.

You're one of the Seattle Grace Five. [You survived a plane crash] And a car crash. And a shooting. You might be immortal. You mastered one of the most exclusive specialties basically overnight, and then you took Herman's job and her eyesight. You have screwed dozens of interns, and you got them all fired. You speak really fast, like superhuman fast. You have a weird name... They say you have two legs, and you are only pretending that one is amputated. For the parking space.|'''[[Stephanie Edwards]]''' to '''[[Arizona Robbins]]'''}}\n\n'''Arizona Robbins''' is the former [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Fetal Surgery]], an [[Attending]] [[Pediatric Surgery|Pediatric Surgeon]], and a board director at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She is the ex-wife of [[Callie Torres]] and the mother of [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]]. To better the happiness of her daughter, she decided to move to New York to be closer to Callie.\n\n\n\nArizona was named after the battleship, the U.S.S. Arizona, on which her grandfather served and died after saving  men. She came from a military family, her father being a Colonel in the United States Marine Corps. Her brother later joined the army and died because there weren't enough doctors.\n\nWhen she was growing up, she moved every  months due to her family's involvement in the military. Whenever they would get somewhere new, her father would take her skating first thing. Wherever they ended up, the skating always stayed the same, which made her feel safe. She did it in college, in med school, and when she first got her job at Seattle Grace. She noticed the skating made the kids feel at ease, too.\n\nThe way she described her upbringing is that she was \"..raised to be a good man in a storm. Raised to love my country. Love my family. Protect the things I love.\" It led her to be patriotic as well as loyal and dedicated in her adult life, especially to her family.\n\nShe learned to act tough when she had to, due to her name, and she never had to \"come out\" to her parents because it wasn't a shock to them. She had a poster of Cindy Crawford in her room and she wasn't looking at her beauty mark. She never brought any boys home and when she finally brought home a girl, Joanne, her mother wasn't surprised. She had expected her father to react by saying \"How fast can you get the hell out of my house?\" but instead he asked her \"Are you still who I raised you to be?\".\n\nShe attended [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]].\n\nDuring her [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]], she was a \"full-on horror show\". She was later chosen as Chief Resident for her th and final year of residency.\n\n\nAfter completing her [[Resident|residency]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], Arizona was hired as a [[Fellow|surgical fellow]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace Hospital's]] [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgery department]]. When [[Attending#Department Head|head]] pediatric surgeon [[Jordan Kenley]] died, Arizona was promoted to department head and took over Dr. Kenley's cases. She worked together with [[Alex Karev]] and [[Miranda Bailey]] on [[Jackson Prescott]], a young boy dear to Bailey. They disagreed when Arizona wanted to change Dr. Kenley's course of treatment. Arizona thought it wasn't working, though Bailey fully supported Kenley's plans. Arizona agreed to follow Kenley's course of treatment for another day, but did want to explore other options. She told Bailey they'd meet in the OR as she rolled off on her Heelys, which made Bailey start to dislike her.\n\nThe dislike grew in the OR where Arizona said that it was a miracle that Jackson was still alive, as he should've been on the transplant list a year ago. Behind Arizona's back, Bailey complained about her to Richard, though he didn't really listen and he assured her that Arizona was the best. When Arizona told Bailey after surgery to put Jackson on the transplant list, Bailey asked to get a second opinion. Arizona gave her [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Wish You Were Here|Norman McCale's]] number, saying he'd totally agree with her plan. Bailey said there was no need to snap, but Arizona found there was. Arizona said that she got that Bailey kept on second guessing her as she liked and trusted Kenley, but she said that she was not the problem. She asked Bailey to start thinking about Jackson instead of her, as he needed all the time he could get. Bailey later realized that Arizona was \"okay\", which she also told the Chief, to whom she had earlier complained.<ref>[[Wish You Were Here]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] was asked by another hospital at Boise to send over a couple of surgeons to assist the surgeons at Boise with a surgery to separate conjoined twins, a surgery the doctors in Seattle had successfully completed [[This Magic Moment|earlier that year]]. Originally, Alex was on the plane to Boise to represent [[Pediatric Surgery|Arizona's department]], but then Arizona heard that he had chosen to take the fellowship at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]] instead of staying in Seattle to study under her. She was furious, scolded him and yelled at him, saying that he could no longer represent the hospital. She took his place on the plane and pulled him off every single pediatric case before she left. During their flight, the back of the plane broke off and the plane crashed in the woods.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after the crash, Arizona was lying next to the front part of the wreckage and she kept on screaming until Cristina yelled at her to shut up. Arizona then points Meredith, Mark, and Cristina into the direction of a consistent banging sound, which turned out to be Lexie, who was crushed under a part of the plane, banging a belt against the metal. While the others went away, Arizona sat up and tore open her pants, revealing she had an open femur fracture. She was panicking when the pilot asked if there was someone there. He told her he couldn't move. She told him her name and instructed him not to move, as he could injure himself even more. She informed him that she thought they were all alive and then started laughing because she was in shock. When he told her he couldn't feel his legs, she suddenly stopped laughing, and he said he knew that was bad. \n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Arizona splinting her leg.]]\n\nLater on, Cristina came back and sought supplies to help splint Arizona's leg. Arizona told her she could do it herself, which she did, but asked Cristina to take a look at Jerry, the pilot of the plane, who was found to be paralyzed. When Cristina yelled, \"I found it!\", Arizona thought she found the first aid box, but Cristina was talking about her shoe. Arizona then looked at her hand, and noticed there was dry blood on it. She then coughed up blood again. In the evening, Cristina, Meredith, and Derek dragged Mark's body back to the front part of the plane. Mark then informed Arizona that Lexie died. When Arizona was asking Jerry about the  hours he mentioned earlier, a helicopter passed over the woods, and she screamed along with the others, but it didn't help. While she was out in the woods, Alex left her a message to tell her that he chose to go to Hopkins to see if he was something without her around. When it got dark, Mark told her that he was ready to go to Lexie, but Arizona convinced him to fight to stay alive as she, Callie, and Sofia were waiting for him. Back in Seattle, Callie was dressed in sexy lingerie, waiting for Arizona to come home.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:xArizonaRobbins.png|thumb|px|Arizona makes Callie promise not to cut off her leg.]]\nAfter four days in the woods, Arizona and the others were taken to the hospital in Boise, where scans were taken of her leg. While the Chief in Boise recommended amputation, Arizona interfered and told Owen she gave no one permission to cut off her leg. Following her request to go to Callie, she and the others were sedated and put on a plane to Seattle, where Callie started taking care of the infected leg. After Bailey's visit with Sofia, Arizona realized her future was uncertain. The thought of an amputation came back in her head, which scared her so much that she urged Callie to come up with a plan to save the leg and she made her promise that she wouldn't cut if off, and so Callie did. Callie did come up with a plan to save the leg and although Owen mentioned a prosthetic would give Arizona a much better quality of life, the surgery was planned. However, when Alex visited Arizona, she started crashing because of the infection. He did everything he could, but she kept deteriorating. He went to Callie, who was in the middle of the surgery on Derek's hand, and she ordered him to cut off the leg and do his best at it. After the surgery, Callie held Arizona's hand until she woke up.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nAfter her left leg was amputated, Arizona became depressed. When Mark died  days later, Callie went into her bedroom, where Arizona was just sitting in bed, and she told Arizona that she couldn't keep doing things alone. She yelled at Arizona to get out of bed and \"snap at out this\". While Callie was ranting over how Sofia lost a parent and she lost her best friend, Arizona turned towards Callie. \"Snap out of this? Snap out of ''this''?\" Arizona said while she revealed her residual limb. \"How the hell am I supposed to snap out of this when you cut off my leg?\" Arizona says. She then turns her back towards Callie again, while Callie left her alone.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Arizona blames Callie for making her decisions.]]\n\nSome time later, Callie told Arizona, who was back at home in a wheelchair, about the settlement the survivors were offered by the plane company. While she kept on talking about how good the settlement would be for them, Arizona ignored her and didn't respond, and even pulled away when Callie tried to make physical contact with her. The next day, Callie told Arizona she should come to the settlement meeting to make her own decision about whether or not she wanted to take it. Arizona started sniping that she didn't need to be there, as Callie was there and that Callie took other decisions for her, too, like the one to cut off her leg. Callie came home to get Arizona for the meeting anyway, only to find her sitting in a pool of her own urine in the bathroom, having fired the homecare nurse for not liking her. Arizona blamed Callie that Callie's decision to cut off her leg made her unable to go the toilet on her own. Against her will, Callie picked her up and put her in the shower, and made it clear that Arizona's problems were her problems too, as they lived together. Without Arizona, she went to the meeting, where it was decided not to take the settlement.<ref>[[Love the One You're With]], x</ref>\n\nArizona agreed to go to the hospital to fit a prosthetic, but only if no one knew about it, though Callie accidentally told Alex because she thought he had seen Arizona. Meanwhile, Arizona was introduced to her prosthetist, [[David Moore]]. He took a look at her residual limb, commenting that it was healing well as there was no scar tissue. Later, he was putting plaster bandages on Arizona's residuum when Callie came in, thinking Arizona would be ready. Arizona yelled at her for not checking her voicemail, where she left her a message. The next day, Arizona tried on her first prosthetic. Without checking it first, she told him it was fine. He told her not to rush and tried to get her up to take a few steps, but she yelled to let her go when he tried to help her up. He made it clear she still needed help with her leg and that she should let the people in her corner help her. He then went away to do other work and left her alone to give her some time. While she was alone, she tried to take a few steps when Alex came in. She fell, but he caught her. He then took a look at her left leg too and told her they needed her back in her department. \"I'm trying,\" she says. Before he left, he told her Callie was trying too. When David got back, Arizona was standing in front of a mirror. She then gave him some remarks about the prosthetic and he told her he'd do something about it. At the end of the day, Arizona allowed Callie, who was ready to go back to Mark's place, to sit next to her on the couch to watch American Bake Off together.<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n[[File:xArizonaleg.jpg|thumb|xpx|Arizona being fitted for a prosthetic leg]]\nHearing how Callie was struggling with Arizona, Bailey planned to get Arizona back to work. She used a difficult case to lure Arizona out of her apartment and to the hospital. With fake promises to deliver the patient's chart, she managed to get Arizona walking to the door of her apartment. As the chart wasn't there, Arizona was angry and called Bailey, who promised her to check with happened with the chart. She didn't hear back from Bailey, she left an angry message, which was all part of Bailey's plan. When Bailey didn't reply, Arizona left her apartment to go the hospital and get the chart herself. While Bailey confessed to Callie that she may have pushed Arizona too hard, they saw her walking in the hallway. Bailey told Callie to hide, as her presence would mean too much pressure. Arizona walked over to Bailey, and when she saw the chart, she came up with a possible diagnosis. She informed Bailey on the disease, who was actually just playing stupid to make Arizona feel comfortable at work again.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Arizona returns to work.]]\n\nOn Arizona's first day back at work, Callie urged everyone not to make a big deal out of it and unbeknownst to Arizona, she put [[Heather Brooks]] on wheelchair duty, so Arizona would have a wheelchair nearby when she wanted to sit down. Despite everyone's efforts not to make a big deal out of it, like Alex paying a kid not to ask her about the fake leg, there were some comments about her return and prosthetic, like Bailey mentioning her first surgery was a lot of standing for her first day back. Arizona also walked slower with her walking stick than other doctors, like Alex, who could still run. When they got paged to the ER, Arizona told Alex to run and that she'd follow. While walking to the ER, Arizona noticed Heather with the wheelchair and asked if she could help her, but Heather talked herself out of it with an excuse. When Arizona finally arrived in the ER, April and Alex had already taken the kid to [[Computed Tomography|CT]]. After surgery, Arizona was so proud of herself for getting through the day and completing the surgery that she put all her weight on her left foot, which caused her to fall down. Alex was really worried and sent everyone out to give her some time, but she just laughed about it. After work, Callie came home where she saw Arizona having a little dance party with Sofia, and Arizona told her about her good day.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n\nDespite being asked to be a bridesmaid, Arizona didn't want to go to Bailey's wedding because she wouldn't be able to wear high heels, and flats make her feel less feminine and confident. Callie tried to cheer her up, but it didn't really work. Callie then acknowledged the wedding would just be another reminder of the leg, but told her she was still more beautiful than the other women at the wedding. The next day, moments before leaving for the wedding, Arizona confessed she still wanted to stay home. Callie was angry and told her that the wedding would be all about Bailey and not about the leg, which it had been all about for the past five months. Arizona then put her flat shoe on her prosthetic foot and they left for the wedding, where they waited for Bailey. When Callie confessed she told Bailey she could flee from the wedding, Arizona thought it was a reference to their marriage and was a little offended.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nWhile waiting for Bailey to come to the wedding after the surgery, Callie assured Arizona that her comment to Bailey was just a joke, but this made Arizona think about their marriage. She booked them a room in the hotel where the wedding was organized, and they went there with some mac and cheese cupcakes from the buffet (for in case they worked up an appetite). After preparing the room to get intimate, they confessed they were both nervous. They kissed, but Arizona then said she wanted to take her leg off first while Callie waited in the bathroom, as she wanted the evening to be all about sexy and taking off her prosthetic leg wouldn't be so sexy. Callie thought she was joking at first, but she did what Arizona asked her to when she noticed how serious she was. However, Arizona didn't take off her leg and apologized when Callie came back into the room. She apologized, but she wasn't ready to get sexy again. They ordered champagne to eat with the cupcakes while watching an old movie together. While watching the movie, Arizona suddenly asked Callie not to run, saying she knew she was horrible and that she was finally starting to feel like herself again. She also said that she didn't want everything to be about the leg all the time, and that she couldn't lose Callie. \"So please, don't run,\" Arizona asked her wife. Callie promised her that there was no way she was going to leave Arizona's side, and Arizona then proposed a good old fashioned junior high makeout. After their makeout, they sneaked back to the wedding, where Bailey and Ben were performing their opening dance.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, Arizona had a dream about leg falling apart in hundreds of pieces. She suffered from phantom limb at night, but when it started to happen during the day too, she didn't want to talk to Callie about it. During a surgery, Arizona's leg kept on hurting, forcing her to leave the OR. She went to a lounge, where she took of her prosthetic. [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] and [[Alana Cahill]], the physician advisor, came in, and Arizona assured them she was fine. Owen asked Alana to leave them alone, and Arizona though Alana would have her fired, as she hadn't been very efficient lately. Arizona thought she was going crazy, as she felt pain in a part of her that no longer existed, but Owen assured her phantom limb was a very real thing. He took a mirror out of a closet and placed it in between her legs, so she could visualize a leg that didn't hurt. In the army, he had seen phantom limb before and know some ways to ease the pain, the mirror being one of them. It helped a little, and Owen asked her what Callie said about it. Arizona confessed that she hadn't told Callie, as she wanted to be Callie's wife again after having been her patient for so long. She also didn't want her life to get screwed over by something that wasn't even there. Owen then promised he would help her to figure it out. She later met with Alana, who understood that she was having a moment.\n\n\nOn the day of the judgment about the plane crash, Arizona interrupted Derek's ping-pong game to inform him that the lawyer called to tell that they had to meet at the courthouse. The hospital was found negligent, and each of the survivors was granted  million dollars. The doctors, Arizona in particular, weren't extremely happy about the award and went back to work. Throughout the day, Callie planned a \"survivor's dinner\" to celebrate that they won the case. They called a sitter for Sofia and went to the dinner, where Callie celebrated that Arizona stood up for  hours and that they were all still alive. They also toasted to celebrate Meredith's pregnancy. Back at the hospital, Owen found out the insurance company wasn't going to pay, because with Arizona having taken Alex's place on the plane, there were more attendings on the plane than are normally allowed. This would mean the hospital had to pay the awards for the doctors itself, but since there wasn't enough money to do so, the hospital would go bankrupt.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile attending Meredith's [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|baby shower]], Arizona noted how glowy the pregnant Meredith looked. She then turned to Callie and suggested they have a second baby, as it would be nice to have something new and happy to think about. She suggested that she carry the baby this time and a surprised and enthusiastic Callie agreed.\n\nThey soon started to look through several sperm donors and eventually decided on an Ivy League poet, smart and creative. They were drinking wine while Arizona asked Callie if she was going to like being pregnant, and Callie said it's the best, aside from numerous disadvantages, like no drinking. Arizona then jokingly said goodbye to her glass of wine.\n\nSoon after, Arizona was inseminated. When her period was one day late and her breasts started to hurt, Arizona took a pregnancy test and found out that she was in fact pregnant. She told Callie that they were having a baby when Callie came home that night after a long day of work. They hugged in happiness, and Callie even kissed Arizona's belly.\n\nThe now happy again couple went to look at a house with a pool and a swing set, where Arizona started dreaming of the life she and her family could have there. When Arizona took a step towards Callie, who wasn't paying attention to the house as she was busy working on her phone, she stumbled but managed to right herself, showing that her prosthetic leg is no longer a problem to her. \n\nOn the day of the first ultrasound, Callie was unable to come to the appointment because her surgery on [[Travis Reed]] ran long. Arizona came to the scrub room to inform her that she had missed the appointment, and Callie apologized. She asked Arizona to see the picture of the ultrasound, but Arizona told her that there was no picture. The OB did the ultrasound, but couldn't find a heartbeat. She lost the baby.\n\nLater on, Arizona tried to tell Callie how she felt about the miscarriage. Callie thought she was trying to pick a fight and said that they both lost the baby. She proposed they could wait a while before trying again, but Arizona replied that she didn't want to try again as she couldn't handle any more loss. Callie pushed Arizona to answer when she asked her if that meant she didn't ever want to try again, but all Arizona could say was that she didn't know. A disappointed Callie then left Arizona alone to go check on her patient.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\n\nSoon after her miscarriage, Arizona met a woman named Lauren Boswell at the coffee cart when she accidentally took Lauren's coffee. Arizona apologized, but Lauren made no big deal out of it and just took Arizona's coffee instead. Before walking away, she told Arizona she hoped she'd see her around, charming Arizona. Arizona tried to tell Callie who Lauren was (as her name was on the cup of coffee), but Callie was too occupied with trying to get through to Bailey, who had locked herself in her lab. Lauren and Arizona did meet again later when Lauren turned out to be the [[Craniofacial Surgery|craniofacial surgeon]] flown in to consult on a case of Arizona and Jackson. Lauren said she looked forward to talking strategy later on that day, charming Arizona again. While talking about the approach, Callie came in and Arizona introduced her to Lauren. Lauren continued explaining her approach, and said she'd make sure to show off a little in surgery for Arizona. Impressed by Lauren's skills, Callie whispered to Arizona that she was a little bit in love with Lauren, and Arizona awkwardly smiled. At the end of the day, Arizona met Lauren again in the elevator, which was what Lauren had hoped for. She complimented Arizona's eyes, and Arizona then said she was married to Callie and that she only had one leg. As she walked out of the elevator, Lauren said she already knew this as there is only Arizona Robbins on the Internet. Arizona smiled as the doors closed, charmed by the attention she was getting and her having only one leg being no problem for Lauren.<ref>[[Do You Believe in Magic]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Owen informed his staff that they had to cancel all elective procedures as preparation for the superstorm heading towards Seattle, Callie asked Arizona if she was going to postpone Tyler's surgery. Arizona snapped that a baby with his brain on his face wasn't elective and walked away. While presenting the procedure to Tyler's parents, Arizona told the parents she was not worried a bit, clearly complimenting Lauren's skills. Outside the room, Lauren and Arizona chatted for a while, and Arizona confessed that she googled Lauren too. They discovered they studied under the same surgeon, which made Lauren allow Arizona to do part of the surgery. Lauren then asked to get coffee before the surgery, but Arizona said she had other things to do. Lauren joked Arizona was probably going to cyber-stalk her some more, and Arizona replied she might. \n\nWhile scrubbing in early for the surgery, they discovered they were both control freaks. They started flirting somewhat, until Jackson entered the scrub room too. During the surgery, Lauren complimented both Arizona and Jackson for having bought the hospital and saved the staff. She looked right into Arizona's eyes and told her she was impressed. She asked Arizona to move closer to her to start her part of the surgery, while she offered to let Jackson do another part. At the end of the surgery, Lauren left to go the bathroom and Jackson then said that Lauren was just one of these people who could make you feel great. He wished she could stay around a little longer, and Arizona quietly agreed. Later that day, during the proposal when Matthew told April he felt a shock when he first saw her, Arizona and Lauren looked at each other. \n\nMoments later, the storm hit Seattle and Arizona and Lauren went to talk to Tyler's parents. Outside the room, Lauren asked Arizona to show her to an [[On-Call Room|on-call room]] as she likes to stay close by in case anything happens the first night post-op. Arizona did so, and they were both sorry Tyler's case was over. Lauren then said she would want her back at some point, and Arizona replied that would be great. Arizona stuck out her hand to say goodbye, but Lauren laughed at this. They moved closer and hugged, and as the lights fell out due to the storm, they kissed each other in the dark. When the lights came back on, Arizona pushed Lauren off and walked towards the door, saying she couldn't do this. Right before opening the door, Lauren told Arizona she was allowed to lose a little bit of control. Arizona then locked the door, kissed Lauren again, and took off Lauren's lab coat.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n[[File:xArizonalauren.jpg|thumb|xpx|Lauren and Arizona kiss.]]\nAs Callie started questioning where Arizona was, Arizona got dressed again in the on-call room to get to the understaffed [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]]. Lauren, who was still lying in the bed, asked if she needed an extra set of hands to help out, but Arizona rejected the offer. The situation in the NICU got even more complicated when the electricity died, meaning the ventilator batteries would die eventually. However, Lauren did not listen and came to the NICU anyway, stating she was not going to sit around while there was a room full of babies needing help. Alex happily accepted her help as Arizona had just told them they needed to do anything to keep the parents happy. While looking for spare batteries for the NICU machines, Arizona confessed to Alex that she cheated on Callie with \"that woman out there\" and that she felt horrible about it.\n\nAs Arizona was manually ventilating a baby, Lauren came over and told her that she wasn't going to leave things like this as she liked Arizona a lot. Then Callie appeared, just as the electricity came back on. In the light, Callie noticed Arizona's ring was pinned to Lauren's scrub top. Lauren tried to come up with an excuse, but Callie figured out what had happened. She and Arizona went to a lounge, where they started fighting. Callie questioned how Arizona could cheat on her after everything they've survived, like the plane crash. Arizona then yelled back that Callie hadn't been on the plane and out there in the woods for days, even though she kept on acting like she had been. Arizona then asked if Callie wanted the badge of honor and the warrior wounds for having survived the plane crash. \"Then great, stick out your leg and I will go grab a bone saw and let's even the score!\" Arizona yelled at Callie, who was heartbroken that Arizona still hadn't forgiven her about the leg. Arizona explained that Callie was the one person she trusted most in her life, and she was the one who decided to cut off the leg. Callie yelled back that she did so to save Arizona's life. Arizona yelled back that Callie didn't lose anything, while she did, alluding to her amputation and her miscarriage. A crying Callie replied that she apparently did lose Arizona.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Callie made the comment about having lost her, Arizona was left speechless as an angry Callie left the room. When Jackson came into the board meeting to tell them that Dr. Boswell was in a cab on her way to the airport, Callie outed Arizona as a cheater in front of everyone, embarrassing Arizona. Arizona and Callie were forced to work together on a victim of the mudslide caused by the storm, much to Callie's dislike. She specifically requested Bailey for the surgery on the patient, but since Bailey was busy with Richard, Arizona stepped up as a general surgeon. In the scrub room, Arizona asked Callie to set aside their problems for the patient. During the surgery, Leah complimented Arizona's technique, and Callie then apologized for having stated that Arizona wasn't a general surgeon. Arizona replied that it was okay, as they've all said things they shouldn't have. Later that day, Arizona met Alex in a supply room and they talked about her cheating. She thought it would make them stronger as a couple. She told him the ortho metaphor she worked out to tell Callie, but Alex wasn't enthusiastic about it and advised her to stick to apologizing for being such a slut. While they watched how Richard was brought to the OR, Arizona unsuccessfully tried to make eye contact with Callie.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nLater that evening, Arizona found Callie and asked her to have a conversation. She started saying that she deserved Callie telling everyone what she did, but Callie broke her off, saying now wasn't the time to talk. When Arizona came home after work, she found out that Callie took her clothes, Sofia, and some of Sofia's clothes. Not knowing that Callie was staying at Meredith's with Sofia, Arizona went back to the hospital and tried to get someone to page Callie , as Callie didn't reply to Arizona's pages. She got Alex to do so, but Callie was too drunk already to reply. Arizona was paged to Meredith's room, where Meredith told her that Callie and Sofia were at her house. Arizona went there, and she and Callie argued over their marriage and the decision to start a family while Derek watched Zola and Sofia. The next day at the hospital, Callie told Arizona, who started apologizing for the previous night, that they were going to take a break and live apart for a while, with switching off Sofia every two nights. They would do it like that for unknown time. However, that night, Arizona came to Meredith's house asking for a couple of minutes with Sofia. Cristina interfered and made Callie allow it. Arizona took her daughter to the deck, where she told Sofia that she loved and missed her.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nArizona decided to look nice to get Callie back. She got a haircut and chose Callie's favorite red dress. It was an incredibly busy day at work, as the hospital, which was in financial difficulties after the damage done by the storm, needed both doctors and board members. Also, several board members were out and Callie and Arizona couldn't be in the same room together, complicating things even more. Arizona reminded Callie that they had an appointment for couples' therapy, but Callie wasn't sure she was going to be there yet. In the evening, Owen did finally manage to gather all the board members to plan a fundraising gala to help out the hospital financially. At the end of the day, Callie did show up at the therapist's office, but only to tell Arizona that she was not going to therapy with her yet. She advised Arizona to follow therapy on her own for a while. Arizona begged her to talk about what happened as she really needed to talk, but Callie, who noticed Arizona wore the red dress, didn't want to talk about the cheating as it hurt her and walked off, leaving behind a devastated Arizona.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nArizona went to the fundraising gala, but soon left after having shared some awkward looks with Callie, who started to tell people that her wife died in the plane crash just to get more donations out of the rich people at the party. Arizona went to the hospital and started crying in a supply closet, only to be found by April, who was sent back to the hospital by Jackson to get cooling blankets for the champagne bottles. Arizona made up an excuse and told April she was fine, but started crying again as soon as April left the room. At the gala, April overheard Callie's fake story of being a widow and she decided to support Arizona. She took two bottles of champagne and returned to the hospital to drink with Arizona. Arizona then confessed she couldn't stand the way everyone stared at her, and the way everyone talked and judged her, including April. \"I know you're trying to hide it, but I can see it on your face,\" Arizona said. Arizona didn't deny she was a cheater, and explained that she cheated because Lauren stared at her too, but in a different way. She stared in a way that made Arizona feel really good. They got drunk, and paged Leah to the closet to get them some more champagne and snacks. Arizona asked April if she thought Callie was ever going to forgive her, and April honestly told her that Callie was telling everyone at the gala that Arizona was dead, so she guessed not. They got drunker and got more fun, both agreeing that they need to have fun again. At some point, April asked her if she could try on her leg and they both laughed. They called a cab to get them home, and Leah helped Arizona to get in. Leah asked Arizona to treat her with more respect. \"You're adorable,\" Arizona said, as she touched Leah's nose. Arizona then closed the door and the cab drove off.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nSome time after the gala, Leah brought Arizona a cup of coffee before the big surgery with Shepherd. Arizona asked April what she did to make Leah so nice to her, and then vaguely remembered that she may have brought Leah home with her the night of the gala. She was drunk then and now only had a vague memory of Leah in her kitchen, making her question if she slept with her. Arizona handed over the mortgage slips to Callie, who snapped at her. Arizona said that if Callie wanted her to move out, she only had to ask, but Callie replied she didn't want to live in the apartment she shared with her cheating wife. During the surgery, Leah came in, ready to scrub in. She told Arizona that Arizona promised to allow her to scrub in on the surgery on the night of the gala. Leah promised her she wouldn't tell anybody what happened, but Arizona cut her off and said she could be more useful handling patients on the floor, making Leah leave. That night, Arizona had a drink at Joe's bar, when Callie came in and told her that she was kicking Arizona out of the apartment right now, not even allowing her to pack up her stuff. Leah overheard this and offered her to stay at her place, and Arizona then asked her to tell what they did after the gala as she didn't remember and she was worried about what happened as Leah was a pretty girl. Leah told her she went to check if Arizona made it home, only to find her passed out on the hallway floor. They went inside, had a dance party, and ate grilled cheese sandwiches while watching videos of Shepherd performing a spinal AVM surgery, which is when Arizona promised her she could scrub in. Arizona confessed she only vaguely remembered the grilled cheese, and Leah then asked her to go back to the part where she said she was pretty, making Arizona smile in embarrassment.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nArizona and Leah started off a somewhat secret relationship and hung out together, but Leah thought it was more than Arizona did and she kept on texting Arizona. At the hospital, Leah told her she was ready to take it further. Arizona didn't think it was a good idea, though she still agreed to hang out that night. Leah planned to scrub in on a surgery with Arizona, which was observed by [[Emma Marling|Emma]], but Arizona said the OR was full and sent Leah away. In surgery, Arizona asked Alex about his strategy to get away from someone who gets way too attached after a one-night stand, which wasn't even a real one-night stand. \"You know who's like that? Leah Murphy,\" Alex said, adding that Leah goes from zero to \"I love you\" in  seconds. Leah eventually told her fellow residents that she was having something with Arizona. Arizona waved her over and Leah apologized to Arizona for having told them, but Arizona then said she was going to be very frank. She said the other night was a bad call because she was lonely, that it was just once and that it would stay that way, and she asked Leah to adjust her expectations if she was expecting more. An emotional Leah said it was her fault and apologized for having misunderstood as she tried to hold back her tears. This touched Arizona and she tried to talk, but Leah ran off into the restroom. That night, Arizona felt lonely again in her hotel room and decided to text Leah again.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nArizona started off a sexual relationship with Leah and they agreed it would just be sex. However, the night before Halloween, Leah did sleep over, which they had previously agreed she wouldn't do. Arizona didn't seem to mind and let go of their agreement when she offered to have breakfast together, but Leah left as she wanted to show Arizona she was serious about being easy peasy. At the hospital, Arizona and Callie found out they both made different costumes for Sofia. Arizona proposed to have Sofia choose between her astronaut costume and Callie's princess costume, but Callie thought it wasn't worth the fight and told Arizona she could take Sofia to the party at Meredith's. Before going to the party, Arizona opened up to Leah, who was scared she got HIV after a patient bit her,  about her first disease scare during her residency and she told Leah she didn't have to try to be easy peasy all the time. In the evening, Callie and Arizona eventually both went to Meredith's party and set aside their problems that night for Sofia. They combined their costumes, so Sofia dressed up as a space princess, which was the first thing they agreed on in months. Together with Meredith and Derek, they took Sofia out for trick-or-treating.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Emma Marling was offered a position as maternal-fetal surgeon, Arizona informed her that Callie, her ex-wife, was going to interview her. Emma asked for more information about Callie, and Arizona told her that Callie is great, but not that great as they're divorced now. During a conversation with April, Arizona revealed that she and Leah took the flirtation further and had amazing sex. After the interview, Emma asked Arizona how long she and Callie have been divorced, and while playing with her necklace, Arizona admitted that she didn't think they were, saying they were more more just separated than divorced. Emma noted that Arizona was still wearing the ring while seeing other people, which Arizona confirmed. Emma apologized for being too personal, but Arizona didn't mind as they do too personal on a daily basis at Grey Sloan Memorial. That night, before joining Leah in the shower in her hotel room, Arizona carefully took off her necklace and carefully put it away in a box.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Callie was informed that both she and the hospital were being sued by [[Travis Reed]], a board meeting was called. They discussed whether or not the hospital should settle, as they were risking bankruptcy all over again if the case was going to trial. The hospital decided to settle, while Callie decided to fight the allegations. When Arizona came to pick up Sofia before Callie had to go to the court for her lawsuit, she told Callie that she was willing to do whatever Callie needed to feel good in the difficult period of being sued. While Callie was putting on her pantyhose, Arizona noted that Callie had her wedding ring back on. Callie replied that she put it on because her lawyer told her to, and Arizona then wished her good luck before leaving with Sofia. During a break in court, Arizona met Callie in the bathroom of the courthouse, where Callie was changing her pantyhose. Callie was feeling awful, and Arizona gave her a drawing Sofia made to make her feel better. Callie took the drawing and thanked Arizona for being there. They then shared a laugh when they discovered Callie had accidentally put on pantyhose with butterflies on them.\n\nDays after, Arizona came to pick up Sofia at Callie's. She was stared at intensely by Callie's dad, as he found out she cheated on his daughter. Feeling uncomfortable, Arizona quickly left with Sofia. However, it was Carlos who later revealed during a conversation with Callie that he once cheated, but he and Callie's mother decided to give their marriage another chance, with Callie's mother having forgiven him for the one mistake he made. Callie then went to Arizona's hotel room, and told her that she got that Arizona made one mistake. She forgave her for that and asked her to come home. She gave Arizona time to think about it and left. Arizona then went back into her hotel room, where she asked a naked Leah to get dressed and leave right now.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after, Arizona moved back into Callie's apartment, though Callie made her sleep on the couch. At work. she and Leah worked together on a girl with a broken femur, which required Callie consulting. Arizona made it clear to Leah that she and Callie were trying to repair their marriage and assured her that it didn't have to be awkward between the three of them. However, Arizona confessed to Callie that she slept with someone more than ten times while they were broken up but assured her that it was over. Arizona begged her wife to keep trying to fix their marriage, and after agreeing, they hugged each other for the first time in months. Arizona didn't mention who she slept with, though Callie figured it out later in surgery when Leah made a mistake and desperately begged Arizona to step in and help her. Arizona did help her, but when Leah was ranting at her after the surgery for having told Callie that they slept together, Arizona made it clear that her marriage was more important than making sure Callie wouldn't hate Leah. At the end of the day, Arizona told an angry Callie that she couldn't keep apologizing and that Callie couldn't keep playing a victim. Arizona said that she was back, but not to be Callie's whipping boy and then demanded to sleep in the bed again. Callie asked for one more night to process Arizona having slept with Leah, and Arizona pointed out she wasn't exactly enthusiastic about Arizona being back.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nArizona and Callie continued to work on their marriage. They managed to stay professional with Leah, who tried her best to forget about Arizona. However, there was still some tension between Arizona and Callie. When Callie was sad because her research was failing, Arizona tried to get her to cheer up, but after some snapping, Callie just walked out on Arizona. While talking with [[Kimmie Kepner|Kimmie]] about their marriages where one of the partners cheated, Kimmie revealed that she and her husband just hope things will get better as they don't feel the need to talk it to death. At the end of the evening, Callie and Arizona started fighting again at their apartment. They then realize that them trying to talk with each other so much may be the problem, and they kiss each other passionately.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of April's wedding, Callie and Derek started the second phase of their research. When Callie joined Arizona in surgery, she told her wife that it was a good thing for her, as the goal of the research was to get Arizona a leg that's as sensitive and responsive as the leg she lost. During the surgery, Callie asked Arizona if she would wear her high heel leg to the wedding, but advised her not to as the wedding was at a muddy farm and Arizona's leg always gets sore after a while. Arizona said she'll be fine, and then Callie heard that the boy they were operating on was most likely accidentally paralyzed by his father, who didn't wait for an ambulance after the accident. Callie started criticizing the father, but Arizona came to his defense. \"Sometimes we try to make things better and we have actually no idea that we're actually causing more pain,\" Arizona said, clearly also talking about Callie trying to fix her.\n\nAt the wedding, Callie once again brought up that she was doing the research for Arizona. Arizona started crying a bit, and she quickly went to the farm with Callie. Arizona went to help April to get dressed up, and broke down in the dressing room. She revealed it was driving her crazy how Callie kept on trying to forgive and take care of her. She clarified she really wants to fix the relationship that she had broken, while Callie wants to fix her. Arizona added that that's what made Lauren so attractive, as she was still attracted to Arizona, even though she never knew her before the accident. Callie makes her feel like she's not enough, and she knows it's unfair to Callie, which is why she hates feeling like this. \"Callie is trying to fix everything and I'm finally feeling okay the way that I am now, and I'm not sure Callie will ever make me feel that way,\" Arizona concluded as April hugged her to comfort her. Arizona walked April down the aisle and shared a look with Callie, which made her cry once again.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nCallie and Arizona decided to use a surrogate to try to have another child. However, they got into a fight in the waiting room at the surrogacy agency and put the idea on hold. They decided to go see a [[Kim Dawson|marriage counselor]] who told them to take a  day break. During their first attempt, they kissed on day  and had to re-start. On the second go, day , Callie and Arizona slept together, but agreed not to tell their marriage counselor. As Arizona kept busy with her new fellowship, Callie confided in Meredith and they went to Joe's bar together. On day , they went back to the counselor together, where Arizona said that she needed Callie, her anchor. However, Callie responded that she had spent the last  days feeling free, doing more and feeling better. She decided she didn't want to be with someone who made her feel stuck and she believed that working on their marriage was slowly killing her. <ref>[[Bend & Break]], x</ref>\n\n\nArizona began a new fellowship at GSMH with [[Nicole Herman|Dr. Nicole Herman]], an outstanding fetal surgeon who began to teach Arizona all her skills and knowledge.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref> Arizona quickly learned that Dr. Herman had a brain tumor and had been given six months to live.<ref>[[Don't Let's Start]], x</ref> Dr. Herman stated that in that time, she would teach Arizona everything she knows for none of her knowledge is written down in books and she wanted her knowledge to be known so it could save more lives. Arizona agreed to continue to work with her without telling anyone else.<ref>[[Could We Start Again, Please?]], x</ref> However, she began to suspect that Dr. Herman's behavior change was due to the tumor and had her scans sent over for her to look at. She consulted with [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], who later told Arizona that she believed she could remove the tumor.<ref>[[Risk]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Alex moved out and sold the house back to Meredith, Arizona had to move out. She found a house and pinned a flyer to a board at the hospital to find a roommate. Much to her discomfort, nobody was interested, so she took a tab of her own flyer to make other people interested. Throughout the day, Arizona noticed that Stephanie acted as if there were a reason that people didn't want to live with her. When confronted about this, Stephanie confessed that Arizona intimidated residents and interns because of everything she had been through and done in both her professional and personal life. At the end of the day, intern Andrew DeLuca showed interest as nobody else wanted to live with him. Arizona decided they'd work it out and accepted him as her roommate.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nOn Bailey's first day as Chief, Arizona was confronted with Callie enthusiastically telling everyone but her about her fantastic new girlfriend. That sparked a little bit of jealousy in Arizona, but she told Callie she could still always talk to her. When Callie started talking about how great her girlfriend was and how they connected, Arizona asked her to dial down the enthusiasm a little and advised her to read the room before opening her mouth.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\nArizona had a moment of looking back on her life when she worked together with Alex on two equally sick twins and they had to decide which one would get the donor liver. The situation reminded Arizona about their first case together and she shared that she was very proud of him and that she trusted him to handle this case well.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter having heard about Penny through Callie's stories, it was finally time for Arizona to meet her at the dinner party at Meredith's house. Arizona really wanted to meet her, but she was nervous and it also reminded her that she had nobody. That day, she bonded with an old patient who found new love in a retirement home, and that man made her believe that she'd find love again. Up until that day, she thought she'd screwed up the one great love of her life. That evening, Arizona was nervous about meeting Penny at the dinner party and started drinking excessively to ease her nerves.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref> The drinking helped to ease her nerves and she and Penny were introduced by Callie. They bonded over a shared experience of moving all the time as a kid. Arizona really took a liking to Penny and described her as perfect, which led her to wonder why she didn't have a Penny herself. She joked about taking Penny home, until the dinner party was blown when Meredith revealed that Penny was the doctor who had failed to save Derek. Arizona then took to eating dessert right out of the dish before April took her home.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Arizona decided it was time to get back in the dating pool and picked trivia night at a lesbian bar as the perfect opportunity to dip her toe in. Both April and Alex turned her down to accompany her, but Richard was very interested in a trivia night. She didn't dare to tell him the truth until they were at the bar. She confided she was nervous to start dating again and didn't know where to start. Richard proved a very capable wingman and got her connected to several women to her liking.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref>\n\nArizona was interested in a female firefighter named Charlotte, who ended up at the hospital with a gluteal burn. Arizona inadvertently complimented her butt and they bonded over the fact that both their jobs meant that other people had to go through something bad. She approached Richard so he could find out if Charlotte was also interested in her, but he refused to wingman a patient. Arizona tried to ask her out, but Charlotte mistook it as an invite for a follow-up. She went to ask Richard for advice, and was told that she was a smart and confident woman. All she had to do was stretch her wings and feel the air. As she gathered up the courage to ask Charlotte out, she was surprised when Charlotte introduced her to her girlfriend. She quickly discharged Charlotte and went to tell Richard that she crashed instead of flew.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the failed attempt, she and Richard continued their nights out to the lesbian bar.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref> Arizona was the first one to find out about April's pregnancy after her divorce to Jackson.<ref>[[Unbreak My Heart]], x</ref> As she tried to steer April towards telling Jackson, Richard inquired Arizona about the woman she had left the bar with. She initially dismissed it as just fine, but he insisted to hear more so he could improve his wingman project. She then said they went \"everywhere.\" Despite the fact that it was fun, she decided not to see the woman again because she was also kind of crazy. As they were operating, Richard asked how many women she was seeing. Arizona replied not so many and asked Andrew to back her up, but then realized he was with his girlfriend every night. She recalled he brought her to their house once and shared she was a real screamer, unaware that she was talking about Maggie. Afterwards, as she was preparing to leave for another date, he told her he worried that a quality person like her was squandering her heart with all those different woman. She said her wingman couldn't also be her dad. He helped her to remember what it was like to be fun and confident and a little slutty, something she wanted to embrace while she was still young and fun. He helped her fly.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref>\n\nApril continued to refuse to tell Jackson about her pregnancy while Arizona continued to advise her to tell him, since other people had already find out. At the end of the day, Arizona witnessed Maggie finally coming clean about her relationship with Andrew.<ref>[[All Eyez on Me]], x</ref> Arizona continued to push April to tell Jackson since she worried April was doing this alone. April then declared Arizona her companion, after which Arizona stated they would do this right with monitoring and tests. However, April refused to have her baby tested, convinced he or she would turn out okay. Arizona tried to get support from Alex, but he initially didn't want to get mixed up in the matter. However, after working with Arizona on a woman with quadruplets, he had a talk with April. While April initially still refused to tell Jackson, she finally realized she needed to do it before he found out from someone else. As she went to see him in his lab, she was shocked to find out that Arizona had just delivered the news behind her back.<ref>[[Odd Man Out]], x</ref> April was furious at her. Arizona explained she didn't want April to go through what happened last time again, but April says her faith in a good outcome would remain until God told her otherwise. She then asked Arizona to stay away from her and told her to go to Hell. Arizona continued to think she did the right thing, but both Callie and Bailey told her she did wrong. Later, Amelia told her that all she could do to make it right was to wait and hope that April would eventually forgive her.<ref>[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]], x</ref> As April continued to be mad, Arizona found herself in the middle of other people's situation again when Callie lied to Penny and told her that Arizona was not comfortable with her meeting Sofia. Upon finding out, Arizona set the record straight and went to tell Callie she was done with getting in the middle of other people's things.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\nThe feud with April was solved when they worked together on [[Jennifer Parker|Jenny Parker]], a pregnant teen who refused to tell her mother about the pregnancy. Having learned her lesson, Arizona respected Jenny's wishes while April eventually told the mother. While April did not consider her situation and Jenny's to be the same, Arizona pointed out she felt about April's situation as April felt about Jenny's. Later that night, April confessed that she had overheard Catherine saying Jackson wanted to sue for full custody over their child and that, refusing to be a victim, she filed for a restraining order against Jackson.<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref> Arizona accompanied April to [[Lucinda Gamble]], a lawyer, to get advice on her situation with Jackson and later gave her an ultrasound to assure her everything was fine with her baby.\n\n\nAt work, Arizona walked in on Callie and Penny getting intimate in a supply closet. Callie later came to apologize, she brought up that Penny was moving to New York after winning the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]]. As she wasn't sure their relationship would survive that, Arizona pointed out there were plenty of ways to make it work if she wanted it to work. That advice backfired heavily as it inspired Callie to decide to move to New York with Penny, and take Sofia with her. She assured Arizona she could see Sofia whenever she wanted and then got paged away, leaving a shocked Arizona. After witnessing Sofia leave with a happy Callie and Penny, Arizona took to Lucinda Gamble herself to start a custody battle over Sofia as she refused to let Callie move across the country with her daughter.<ref>[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]], x</ref>\n\nArizona met up with Callie, who was excited about moving to New York and shared school brochures of New York schools, for which they would need to apply if Sofia were to move to New York. Arizona asked her to take a step back and pointed out she never said yes to the plan. Callie wanted to discuss options, but Arizona said it sounded like she had already decided. She argued Sofia's life was in Seattle. Callie argued that Arizona moved a lot in her youth and she turned out fine. Arizona walked away and discussed the problem with Richard, who understood her urge to protect herself but also exemplified April and Jackson's turbulent situation, caused by overreactions and misunderstandings. He urged her to think about Sofia, who was too important to do something that could not be undone. However, Arizona solidified her stance when she was contacted by a New York school about Sofia's application. Later, Callie came to apologize for jumping the gun, but Arizona told her about the Barton School calling her. Callie explained there were waiting lists. Arizona then gave Callie her lawyer's card and stated they would only talk through her. Callie asked who was jumping the gun now, but Arizona bounced back that she was the one who started this.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], x</ref>\n\nPrior to the hearing, Richard advised Arizona to get some friends to testify for her, however she didn't want to do it and thought the subpoena should do that. Richard encouraged her and she figured out that she would have April and Jackson's support. However, before she managed to ask them for the favor while doing ultrasound for April, Penny came into the room and told Arizona that she was on Arizona's service that day. Later in the cafeteria, Arizona tried to ask Alex to testify for her, which he promptly rejected, as he considered both Callie and her as friends. Penny then appeared. Arizona yelled at her, believing she was spying for Callie, before leaving. Arizona was then found crying in her car by Richard. She told him that she was fighting a losing battle. Richard said if she wanted her daughter, she had to fight like she'd never fought before.<ref>[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]], x</ref>\n\nBefore the custody hearing started, Arizona and Callie's respective lawyers tried to negotiate to prevent going to court, but failed to come to a compromise. In court, after hearing both sides, Arizona was eventually granted sole physical custody of Sofia.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref> Arizona, seeing how sad Callie was, agreed to let Callie have her for alternating school years and Christmases.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nArizona traveled to New York to help Sofia get settled with Callie and Penny. When she returned to Seattle, she was confronted with Andrew's bruised up face. She confronted Alex, who had ignored her concerned calls and texts, and scolded him for his actions. She later assured Andrew she didn't want him to move out of the house and expressed support for him. While still mad at him, Arizona also missed Alex. He told Arizona that the guy she trained and raised was still there since he was determined to work at the clinic to get his job back rather than quitting.<ref>[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Eliza first came to Grey Sloan, she flirted with Arizona, telling her she didn't need to write her name down to remember it.<ref>[[Why Try to Change Me Now]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Eliza came to the hospital to help out after a building collapsed, she was surprised that Arizona appeared not to remember their conversation, but Arizona admitted that she did and she was interested, but she didn't like that Eliza talked like she owned the place. They agreed to go get a drink together afterward. <ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, when Eliza officially started, Arizona had joined the resistance against Eliza's policies. Despite this, Eliza found Arizona at the end of the day and told her that her allowing Leah to take the lead on the Wallace baby was a perfect example of her teaching strategy and thanked her for being on board.<ref>[[Jukebox Hero]], x</ref>\n\nAs Arizona was leaving the hospital the next day, Eliza found her and when she claimed she'd be happy if Eliza was fired, Eliza called her on it, saying it would scare her because it would mean the two of them could be something.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\nAfter losing her first child patient, Eliza was distraught and Arizona coached her on how to get through that loss. At the end of the day, when Arizona was leaving work, she saw Eliza crying in her car and hitting the steering wheel. This caused the horn to honk continuously. Arizona told her to pop the hood and she quickly pulled the horn wire, which she told Eliza she'd need to have fixed. Eliza thanked her and then they hugged. Arizona told Eliza that she could have friends at the hospital if she wanted.<ref>[[It Only Gets Much Worse]], x</ref>\n\nAround the hospital, the two continued to pretend not to get along. However, at the end of the night, Arizona said she didn't want to pretend, because Eliza's nice and funny and people should know that. Eliza told her to be quiet and kissed her.<ref>[[Back Where You Belong]], x</ref>\n\nEliza asked Arizona about how big her stove was, because she wanted to make Arizona pierogi. She then flirtatiously said, in Polish, that once Arizona had her pierogi, she'd never want anyone else's. However, that evening, when Eliza went to find Arizona, she was asleep on the couch. They agreed to rest for a minute and then rally, but they both fell asleep and when they woke up, it was morning. They leaned in for a kiss, but Richard Webber interrupted, discovering their relationship.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n\nAfter they'd been seeing each other for a while, Eliza told Arizona she was ready for them to have sex. They made plans for that night, but they were cancelled when one of Arizona's patients went into labor, but Arizona told Eliza that she looked for her around the hospital all the time and that the anticipation of waiting one more day wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. The next night, they left the hospital and went to Arizona's house, where they had sex.<ref>[[Leave It Inside]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the hospital fire chaos had settled, Arizona found Eliza and suggested they go back to her place to have overly tired sex before getting some sleep. Eliza told her she couldn't. She needed to pack up her things because she'd been fired.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\nEliza \"ghosted\" Arizona, not replying to her messages and moving out of her apartment without saying a word to Arizona about it.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Sofia moved back to Seattle, she told Arizona that she wanted her room to be green, but Arizona couldn't decide which shade, so she told Sofia she could decide herself and they'd paint it together. She also surprised Sofia with three different flavors of ice cream.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nAfter her return to Seattle, Sofia refused to go to school. She said she wanted to go back to New York with her friends and the teacher who let them draw on their notebooks. Instead of making her go to school, Arizona took Sofia to work with her, where Sofia met [[Noah Brosniak]], the son of a patient, and the two played together while Arizona examined Noah's mom. Noah was diagnosed with a brain tumor and when Arizona tucked Sofia in that night, she cried because she realized she was so lucky to have a healthy, smart girl and she was sometimes too busy to understand that. She suggested that she take the next day off and take Sofia to find an adventure.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nAfter that incident, Sofia continued to refuse to go to school. Arizona had to bribe her in order to get her to go to school.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nSofia was suspended from school for stealing the field trip money from her class. Arizona took her to work and put her in the daycare for the day. Then she learned from reading Sofia's diary that she stole the money to buy a plane ticket to New York and didn't want to tell Arizona because she worried about hurting her feelings. That led her to make the decision that Sofia needed to move back to New York and she needed to go with her.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\n\nAt the time of her first appearance, Arizona was a cheerful and bubbly person, waking up happy every day. She genuinely cares for her patients and their relatives. Her bright personality became darker after the plane crash, but over time, she found herself and her happiness again, albeit more serious than she used to be.\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nArizona is a lesbian and was married to [[Callie Torres]].[[File:Callie&Arizona.jpg|thumb|Callie and Arizona]]\n\nAt the [[Emerald City Bar]], she saw that Callie was upset and came to comfort her in the bathroom and kissed her. Callie soon decided to ask her out, but Arizona declined the offer after finding out [[Erica Hahn|Erica]] was Callie's first girlfriend. Her reasons were metaphorical: she deals mostly with newborns at work; she does not want to deal with them in her personal life, but she claimed \"[she is] super flattered. Super.\" at the offer. Annoyed, Callie confronted her, but the situation was made more awkward after she discovered that Arizona was on a date with a woman named [[Julie]].\n\nCallie started to avoid her, but she was eventually cornered in the elevator. Arizona then decided to explain that sometimes she doesn't always make the right choice under pressure and that she was wrong. Callie accepted it and Arizona asked her out again and after pretending not to be interested for a few seconds, Callie accepted.\n\nTheir relationship continued, but when Callie's father came to visit and discovered that she was dating a girl, he cut Callie off. Mark and Cristina both suggested that she lie and say she broke up with Arizona, but after Arizona approached her and told her that she loved how Callie cared so much about things and wouldn't care if Callie lied, Callie decided not to lie because her family should accept her.\n\nHowever, Callie began to withdraw slightly and began to avoid Arizona. Arizona then asked if their relationship was just a fling and it had run its course and Callie told her that it probably was. Arizona later approached Callie and Callie told her the real reason was because she didn't have the money for four-star restaurants anymore but Arizona told her that they could stay in and eat sandwiches. Callie countered that neither of them liked sandwiches, so they settled on pizza instead.\n\nThe relationship was threatened again when Callie got annoyed at Arizona for believing that George joining the army was awesome, but after hearing that Arizona's brother died in the war, she apologized.\n\nOn Arizona's birthday, after a failed surprise party, Arizona told Callie she loved her, and Callie reciprocated her feelings. Callie was dismayed to learn that Arizona didn't want children. She assumed that Arizona's reluctance was related to her brother's death, but Arizona told her she simply liked her life the way it was. They came to the conclusion that they could not continue their relationship, as they both wanted different things. However, after a shooter entered Seattle Grace with a vendetta for Derek, Lexie, and Richard, they were in lockdown together, and eventually decided to get back together and have kids. They passionately kissed in happiness.\n\nSix months after the shooting, Arizona received word that she had been given the Carter Maddison Grant, and was allowed to go to Malawi and become a doctor there. She had applied for this grant two years previously, when she hadn't met Callie yet. After some hesitation, Arizona decided to accept the grant. In the end, Callie was shown to have accepted this as well and decided to leave with Arizona. However, a fight at the airport resulted in Arizona leaving for Africa without Callie. After some time passed, Arizona came back and told Callie she missed her, but Callie closed the door in her face.\n\nCallie continued to reject Arizona's constant pleading and apologies. Eventually, Callie revealed that she was pregnant with Mark's baby. After asking for time to process, Arizona accepted the situation, and she and Callie restarted their relationship. Callie and Arizona later reconciled and they moved back in together. After seeing the baby's heartbeat for the first time, Arizona referred to the baby as \"theirs.\"\n\nHowever, tensions continued with Mark in the picture as an active and interested father. Callie gifted Arizona with a weekend getaway, but continued communicating with Mark as she and Arizona drove. Arizona's jealousy came to the forefront, and the two argued, with Callie concluding, \"Tell me what you want and I'll do it.\" After a pause, Arizona said, \"Marry me.\" They had shocked faces as they approached a stopped truck and crashed. Arizona was slightly battered, but Callie (who'd taken off her seatbelt) flew through the windshield. A series of surgeries followed (including the delivery of [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|her very premature baby]]) along with emotional breakdowns by both Mark and Arizona. Callie eventually woke up and turned to Arizona, who was sitting at her bedside, and whispered, \"Yes, I'll marry you.\" They finally married at a ceremony officiated by [[Miranda Bailey]].\n\nThe plane crash put a strain on their relationship. Arizona made Callie promise that she would not cut her leg off and Callie agreed. However, Arizona had an infection in her leg that she could have died from if she didn't cut off the leg. Because Callie broke the promise, Arizona began to ignore her. Finally, as she regained her strength and confidence when she learned to use her prosthetic. Arizona even became pregnant with a sperm donor's child but miscarried. Their relationship took a turn for the better until Arizona slept with Lauren Boswell during the superstorm, and Callie found out. Callie and Arizona were separated until after Callie's trial when Callie asked Arizona to move back in. After Arizona cheats on [[Callie Torres]] with [[Lauren Boswell]] during the superstorm. When Callie finds out she is furious she ends up kicking her out of the house. After being kicked out Callie and Arizona both agree couples therapy would be the best option. In the end, Arizona and Callie end up divorcing.\n\n[[Lauren Boswell]]\nDr. Lauren Boswell came to GSM to perform a surgery on an infant with his brain growing on the outside of his head. She was very flirtatious with Arizona, who happily flirted back. They would joke about how they looked at each other up on the internet and knew all about each other. At the start of the [[Readiness is All|superstorm]], she asked for Arizona to show her to an on-call room to rest in. Arizona obliged and took her there. They said their goodbyes and Arizona extended her arm for a handshake. Lauren simply laughed and they hugged. The lights flickered off from the superstorm as they started kissing. As the lights flickered back on, Arizona pushed her off, saying that she couldn't do that. Arizona almost left and Lauren said, \"Arizona, you are allowed to lose a little bit of control.\" Arizona pondered the thought for a moment and ended up locking the door instead of opening it. She returned to Lauren and kissed her while she pulled off Lauren's lab coat. The two of them had sex and accidentally exchanged scrub tops, which is how Callie noticed later that Arizona had cheated on her.\n\n[[Leah Murphy]]\nOn the night of the fundraising gala, Arizona Robbins and [[April Kepner]] bonded over drinks in the hospital storage closet. Since they were too intoxicated to drive, Leah called them a cab.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref> Shortly thereafter, Leah called to make sure the girls arrived home safely and ended up visiting Arizona at her apartment. The two watched movies and talked all night (though Arizona remembered none of it). Worried about what took place that night, Arizona asked Leah if anything happened between them and Leah told her nothing had.\n\nHowever, the two ended up making out on a different occasion, causing Leah to become somewhat obsessed with Arizona (much like she did with Alex). Arizona rebuffed her obsession and ended things. Leah told Arizona that she respected her so much and the thought of Arizona thinking about her in that way made her feel amazing. That night Arizona texted Leah asking 'What are you up to?' implying that she wanted her to come over. The two of them ended up sharing a kiss.\n\nOn the morning of Halloween, Leah wakes up in Arizona's hotel bed. She gets ready to leave, waking up Arizona, Arizona says that she doesn't have to leave. Leah says she knows she's not supposed to sleep over and apologizes, but Arizona says it's okay. Leah thinks it's not, as she's all about easy. At the hospital, Leah gets bit in the neck by a drug addict and is tested for HIV. Arizona helped calm her worry. She told Leah a similar story to reach out to her.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref> The two of them continued to see each other sexually until Callie asked Arizona to move back in. \n\n[[Eliza Minnick]]\nWhen a new consultant was hired by Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to revamp their surgical residency program, Eliza made a loud entrance. When Eliza was in the elevator on her way to Bailey's office, Arizona walked by and asked if she needed help. Eliza answered that she forgot where chief Bailey had her office. Arizona then mentioned that Eliza had made a big mistake leaving Arizona's name off the list of good teachers. Eliza insisted that the list was only made to help her remember everyone's names. Arizona wondered why Eliza would not have to learn her name. Eliza then answered, \"That name attached to that face? That's not one you forget.\"\n\nOn Eliza's first day at Grey Sloan, Eliza helped out where she was needed. She then ended up helping Arizona, during which she flirted. Arizona played it cool and acted like she didn't remember their conversation by the elevator. They later agreed to get drinks. However, after Arizona travelled to a prison hospital with Bailey and Jo, and then returned to work on Eliza's official first day, she blew Eliza off, stating that she was too tired. Eliza told her that she only wanted to compliment her on implementing her new teaching method, by allowing Leah to intubate the baby unsupervised.\n\nArizona was later annoyed when Eliza moved one of her surgeries, and accused Eliza of turning everybody against her, but Eliza defended herself by saying that people were simply afraid of change. Arizona blamed Eliza for having Meredith suspended, which surprised Eliza, who was unaware of Meredith's suspension. Later, Arizona was confronted by Eliza in the parking lot, with Eliza claiming while Arizona was acting as though she was against her, she was really afraid of Eliza being fired, as that would mean the pair could pursue a relationship.\n\nWhen Eliza forgot to alert the authorities that Stephanie went missing during the hospital lockdown and explosion, Bailey fired her. When Arizona found her and asked if they could have sex, Eliza said she needed to pack her things since she was fired, leaving Arizona speechless. Arizona then tried to give her some space, but later found out Eliza had left town without saying goodbye, effectively ghosting Arizona.\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nShe met Carina at a bar. She ended up bringing her home and the two had sex.\n\nEven after Andrew came home and interrupted the events, they continued. The next day, when Arizona found out that Carina was at the hospital doing research, she went to see her and Carina continued her flirting.\n\nArizona described the sex the two of them had as pain-relieving.\n\nAfter learning that Sofia was coming back home, Arizona inadvertently broke things off with Carina.\n\nAfter not seeing Arizona for a few days, Carina asked her if she was okay. Arizona said she'd taken a few days off after Karin Taylor's death. Arizona was shocked to learn Carina had never lost a mom, while Carina was shocked to learn Arizona had lost more than one. That inspired Arizona to look into it as a surgical project and once she had written up a proposal, she asked Carina to work on it with her, a decision they sealed with a kiss.\n\nAfter Carina made a comment about moving countries at the drop of a hat, Arizona asked her if she was just going to leave suddenly and end their relationship. Carina said that she had no plans to leave or end their relationship. \n\nWhen Arizona decided she needed to move herself and Sofia back to New York, she ended things with Carina.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nWhen Arizona first worked with Bailey after her arrival at Seattle Grace Hospital, they butted heads when they disagreed over the treatment plan Arizona's predecessor had set for [[Jackson Prescott]], which Bailey had supported. Bailey complained to Richard about Arizona, but he simply told her to work with Arizona because that's who they had. Despite this, Arizona quickly saw Bailey's potential as a pediatric surgeon, claiming she was \"uniquely qualified,\" and supporting her in her decision to apply for a spot in pediatric surgery.\n\nWhen Arizona gave her notice to Chief Bailey in anticipation of moving to New York, Bailey said when she had first met Arizona, she had thought Arizona was a pixie stick, an empty vessel, full of sugar, who skated in a hospital and didn't know then that it would be one of the great privileges of her life to know her and to work with her.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nOn her first day at the hospital, the only person Teddy knew was Owen. They joined Arizona, Mark, and Callie in the cafeteria. After lunch, Teddy and Arizona walked to the ER together. Jackson and Cristina were waiting for Arizona, because their patient was a boy with asthma. Teddy did a little exam and found that the boy had cardiac asthma. She asked for an OR, but Cristina, who had been questioning Teddy's abilities all day, was reluctant. Teddy then made it clear to Cristina that she had to what she said, and left. Arizona smilingly commented that she really liked Teddy. Later, when Arizona noticed Teddy staring mooningly at Owen, Arizona declared that the two of them were going to be friends, going so far as to claim that, \"I'm an awesome friend.\" She suggested that they do a ladies' night.\n\nWhen [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] asked Teddy out, Teddy confided in Arizona, who suggested that Mark was like candy: eat it and forget about it. When things sparked between Mark and Teddy, Arizona was again the one she confided in. When Arizona went to Africa, she and Teddy continued to keep in touch and regularly wrote to each other. When [[Callie Torres|Callie]] became pregnant and asked Arizona to be in, Arizona went to Teddy for advice on whether or not to be in. Arizona arranged ladies night for her after Henry died. Arizona and Teddy continued to keep in touch after Teddy moved to Germany, as Arizona learned about Owen double-dipping from her phone conversation with Teddy. \n\n[[April Kepner]]\nAfter seeing Callie at the [[Puttin' on the Ritz|fundraising gala]], Arizona escaped back to the hospital, where she hid in a supply closet to cry. April found her there and offered comfort, but Arizona kindly sent her away. However, at the party, April overheard Callie tell everyone that Arizona died in the plane crash they were in. Furious at this, she took two bottles of champagne and met Arizona in the hospital storage closet where she was hiding to share a drink and talk. They soon became very open with each other and discussed their relationship problems together, bonding them. April later stood up for Arizona against Callie when Callie mentioned wanting to move back into [[Callie and Arizona's Apartment|their apartment]]. She reminded Callie that Arizona needs the elevator and that it's already retrofitted to be accessible for her.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nRichard and Arizona's relationship started out as a complicated professional one, mainly due to Arizona's authority issues, which would result in her crying whenever the Chief opposed or intimidated her. However, she outgrew those authority issues and they eventually became good friends. Richard accompanied Arizona to a lesbian bar as her wingman and became her go-to person for dating troubles. He was also the one who supported her most during the custody battle and convinced her not to give up.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nAfter becoming Callie's girlfriend, Arizona also became good enough friends with Mark, Lexie, and Cristina. When she returned from Malawi, she asked Callie for a second chance. Callie then revealed that she was pregnant and that Mark was the father. Although initially she was not happy about this development, she decided she was in. However, she developed some resentment towards Mark, which would come to a head after her and Callie\us car crash. Eventually, both Arizona and Mark made up and together with Callie, the three raised Sofia together until Mark's death. When Callie was pregnant Mark and Arizona took an interest in her health and started cooking and trying new recipes together.<ref>[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex Karev and Arizona Robbins started out with a rocky relationship when they first met. But as time went on, Karev realized that Arizona was one of the few people who actually believed in him. Arizona Robbins saw Karev as a promising peds surgeon who was dedicated despite his temper and personal issues and continued to maintain a good mentor-student relationship with him until the end of Alex's residency. Karev's decision to leave [[Seattle]] to take the fellowship offer at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Hopkins]] led her to take his place on a plane that ended up crashing. While she was in the hospital trying to fight the infection in her leg, she mentioned that she was still very much \"pissed off\" and stated that she felt as though Karev should have been in the crash rather than herself, because she spent the whole time thinking about her wife and her baby and he had no wife and no baby; he had no one.\n\nWhen she returned to work, she and Alex maintained their friendship and working relationship with Alex looking out for her. She was unaware that Alex was the surgeon who cut off her leg until years later. Callie didn't tell her because she knew Arizona would hate her and she wanted her to have someone to lean on. When she did find out, she thanked Alex for telling her.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x</ref> While working together with Alex on two equally sick twins and they had to decide which one would get the donor liver they both needed, Arizona had a moment of looking back on her relationship with Alex. The situation reminded Arizona about their first case together and she shared that she was very proud of him and that she trusted him to handle this case well.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nicole Herman]]\nBefore Arizona undertook Nicole's fetal surgery fellowship, they seemed to have a close professional relationship, with Nicole often teasing Arizona about how fetal surgery was more difficult than pediatric surgery. As they began to work together more frequently, they got closer and became less hostile towards each other. They both often jointly spent several nights at the hospital, even going to great lengths as to steal the attendings' lounge sofa together, to continue working on Arizona's crash course. Arizona reached out to Nicole once when Nicole attended \"Blind School,\" but Nicole didn't pick up or call back, leaving Arizona to give up trying to initiate contact. They made up when Nicole returned to Grey Sloan and offered her money to open a center for women's health together.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nOthers\nArizona initially got off on the wrong foot with Dr. Bailey and Karev. Alex couldn't understand how she could be so perky after harvesting organs from a young child. When Dr. Kenley died Dr. Bailey took offense to Arizona changing [[Jackson Prescott|Jackson Prescott's]] course of treatment and proceeded to complain to the Chief and call her an \"infant\". However, Bailey soon realized that Arizona is a competent doctor and grew closer to her after applying for a peds fellowship.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Dr. Robbins at work.]]\n\nFollowing the death of [[Jordan Kenley|Dr. Jordan Kenley]], Dr. Robbins was appointed as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Pediatric Surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She was top of her class and she was the [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]] in her fifth year at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. She then completed her pediatric surgical [[Fellow|fellowship]] at Seattle Grace Hospital.\n\nWhen Bailey and Robbins first worked together, Richard said to Bailey that \"She's the best that anyone's seen in a long time, just like you are\". She is also on a first name basis with the Head of Pediatric Surgery at Johns Hopkins, as she studied under him during her residency.\n\nWhen Arizona won a grant to advance pediatric surgery in less developed countries, she gave her notice and resigned. Later, she returns to Seattle Grace as an attending under [[Robert Stark|Dr. Robert Stark]], the interim Head of Pediatric Surgery. A year later, Arizona resumes her position as the head pediatric surgeon.\n\nShe is very much aware of the nature of her job, Robbins has seen things in pediatric surgery to the extent she has nightmares about the tiny coffins that her patients will be buried in, and so she will remain optimistic in the face of the tragedy involved in her job.\n\nHer optimism and child-friendly abilities can be seen frequently and are also shown as she has cute animals on her lab coat; what appears to be a monkey or a lion above the Seattle Grace logo on the right hand side of her lab coat and a cat above her name and title on the left hand side; and she even wears Heelys at work, heeling around the hospital. When Cristina Yang was put on her service she made Cristina attach a small toy bear, Mr. Bear, to her lab coat and made sure she knew that pediatric surgery was not general surgery in miniature and that Cristina had to like children.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|- residency year]], Arizona decided to start a [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] under [[Nicole Herman|Dr. Nicole Herman]]. Because of brain tumor, Nicole is very harsh on Arizona, as she wants to teach Arizona years worth of fetal surgery knowledge within the six months she has left. She managed to teach Arizona everything from the one-year fellowship in less than half the time, thus making Arizona officially an attending fetal surgeon. When Herman was blind after her tumor resection, Arizona took over being head of fetal surgery.\n\n\n*Arizona wears a Holly Hobbie scrub cap.\n*Arizona likes pizza.\n*She drives a red Volvo S\n*Arizona dislikes sandwiches.\n*Arizona thinks that Sudoku is boring.<ref>[[She's Gone]], x</ref>\n*Prior to her left leg being amputated above the knee, she often wore wheeled sneakers at work.\n*When confronting someone who commands respect and authority, such as [[Daniel Robbins|her father]] or [[Richard Webber|Chief Webber]], she often used to break down and cry, but she seems to have gotten over it throughout the years.\n*When under pressure and in trouble, Arizona smokes cigarettes.<ref>[[Goodbye]], x</ref>\n*Arizona regularly treats patients under the table because she finds it hard to say no to parents of sick babies.\n*When her [[Timothy Robbins|brother]] died, she grieved by eating donuts and crying.\n*When Callie had the chicken pox, Arizona snooped through [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]]'s personnel file to see if she had been vaccinated against the chicken pox, which she had, so she put Lexie in charge of Callie's case.\n*She dislikes pumpkin scones.\n*She went to Malawi after winning a grant. However, this was a dangerous place for her to be as Malawi had strict anti-homosexuality laws at that time. Had she been discovered to be a lesbian, she could have faced up to  years of hard labor if convicted.\n*Arizona's left leg was amputated above the knee following her being in a plane crash.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n*[[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] calls her Mommy.\n*Arizona refers to her patients as tiny humans and to their parents as tiny human makers. \n*She and former patient [[Wallace Anderson]] share the same birthday.<ref>[[Invest in Love]], x</ref>\n*She hates camping.\n*She is the first known attending to have been the Head of two different departments, in this case Pediatric Surgery and Fetal Surgery.\n*During Arizona's third year as a med student, doing an [[Internal Medicine|internal medicine]] [[Clerkship|rotation]], she experienced an HIV-scare due to an incorrect needle retraction while working on an end-stage AIDS patient.\n*When she and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] decided to get pregnant, Arizona started making a list of terrible baby names, which included Raynbow, Bubba, Tulio, Agamemnon, Zamboni, Hashtag, and Digger. Since Callie didn't want any of the cute baby names she wanted, her plan was to bury them in a sea of terrible ones.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x </ref>\n*She used to be a fan of punk rock.

Pretty much everything my father did his whole life was about honoring that sacrifice. I was raised to be a good man in a storm. Raised to love my country, love my family, protect the things I love. When my father, Colonel Daniel Robbins of the United States Marine Corps heard that I was a lesbian, he said he had only one question. I was prepared for, \"How fast can you get the hell out of my house?\" But instead, it was, \"Are you still who I raised you to be?\" My father believed in country the way that you believe in God. And my father is not a man who bends, but he bent for me because I'm his daughter. I'm a good man in a storm. I love your daughter, and I protect the things that I love. Not that I need to.

Emma pitched to the hospital board to have a fundraising gala in an effort to raise the necessary finances, but, unfortunately, they denied her request. Having been turned down, she decided to take part in Grey Sloan's fundraising gala, intending to \"borrow\" some of the donors.\n\nAs a man went to make a donation to hear the promised story, Emma approached Owen to tell him she'd like to hear the story, too. She complimented the party, and they started talking about the clowns. Emma told him she had been afraid that they wouldn't have anything to talk about, but was relieved that they did. As Owen saw Cristina having fun with a donor, he proposed having a drink with Emma. They were interrupted by Cristina, and Owen introduced them. Cristina then pushed Emma to go see a magician, and Emma took her drink and went to see \"the magic\".\n\nOwen later overheard how Emma was talking to donors, stealing his story. Owen told her he had been watching her and that noticed that she was a thief, asking who she was. She revealed she was a\ua[[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal surgeon]]\uaat\ua[[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital|Seattle Pres]]\uaand that she used the gala to gather donations for her own hospital. She told him she was only borrowing his story, and thereby wasn't a thief. Owen asked her why she spent so much time talking to him when she was at the party to collect donations, and she confessed she found him a goodlooking man. She and Owen sticked together to listen to Jackson's speech, though Owen had to leave her when he had to take care of [[Ari Rocchi]] after she threw herself under the falling acrobat.\ua\n\nAt the end of the night, Emma went to Grey Sloan Memorial to talk to Owen. She interrupted Cristina and Owen's conversation and said she had worked up a good excuse, but when she was face to face with Owen, she completely blanked. Cristina noticed that Owen was charmed by her, and left the two of them alone so they could talk in private.\ua''(\"[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]\")''\n\n\nEmma and Owen stayed in touch after the gala night, and she brought homemade banana bread to his work. He told Callie about it, who commented that it practically made her his girlfriend.\ua''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\nEmma visited Grey Sloan Memorial again to observe one of Arizona's surgeries, about which Owen had called her. She commented to Owen that she hoped Arizona didn't know that they were dating, as she preferred to keep things professional at work. Owen assured her Arizona didn't, but he confessed that he did tell a couple of people and asked if he shouldn't have. Emma said it was okay, and they shook hands while she thanked him for having called her. As she left to go meet Arizona, she ran into Cristina, who asked Owen if it was \"bring your girlfriend towork day\".\ua\n\nLeah introduced Emma to Arizona, who updated her on the patient. Arizona then asked Leah to show Emma where she could get scrubs, and so Leah did. In surgery, Emma tried to talk about the surgical electrothermal sealers, but Arizona and Alex had a conversation one night stands, Leah Murphy in particular.\n\nAfter surgery, she accidentally left her phone in the scrub room and she met Cristina when she later returned to pick it up. She asked Cristina about her cutting edge approach, and she told Cristina she was impressed by her enormous balls. Emma said she wished she could stick around to watch her surgery, but Cristina then informed her that she was Owen's ex, which Emma didn't know. The situation got awkward, and she quickly left after having told Cristina she couldn't wait to hear how the surgery went.\ua''(\"[[Map of You]]\")''\n\nAfter finding out about Owen's past marriage through her conversation with Cristina, Emma decided that Owen wasn't ready yet for a new relationship yet as he hadn't told her himself. She told him to call her when he was ready, which he did on Halloween. He left her a message to tell her that, in contrast to his relationship with Cristina where everything was difficult, she was simple and easy. He realized that it sounded wrong and asked her to delete the message. He hung up, but apparently Emma had listened to his message as he was leaving it, as she immediately called him back.\ua''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\n\nWhen an opening for maternal-fetal surgeon became available at Grey Sloan, Arizona thought of Emma first and pitched her to the board. They wanted one of them to sit down with Emma to interview her, and Callie was the chosen one. While Callie was eager to get to know Emma, Emma was informed by Arizona that Callie was her ex-wife. They met and after Owen introduced her to Callie, Emma and Callie entered a conference room for the interview.\n\nIn the interview, they looked over Emma's resume, which is impressive according to Callie. She revealed that she left [[Cleveland Clinic]] after a year because she was going through a divorce at the time. Callie was curious for details, and Emma told her some more. Callie asked her if it was hard for her to leave her city, which Emma found to be a difficult question to answer. When Callie asked Emma what her typical Saturday looks like, Emma said she had no problems with working in the weekends, but Callie was more wondering about what she did for fun. \"What feeds your soul?\" Callie asked, and Emma responded that she likes to read, to cook and to watch movies. Callie then asked if she had kids from her previous marriage, and when Emma said she hadn't, Callie wanted to know if she was interested in ever having kids. \"I don't think you can legally ask me this in a job interview,\" Emma said, but she did answer the question by saying she imagines having two girls in the future, even though she knows girls are hell in junior high. When Callie wanted to ask some more questions, Owen came in to ask how the interview was going, and Emma turned her head to tell him it was going great, Callie made very enthusiastic signals to Owen. When Emma turned her head back towards Callie, Callie said in a neutral voice that they were making progress.\ua\n\nAfter the interview, Arizona told Emma that Callie loved her. Emma said that Callie was thorough but very nice, and asked how long they'd been divorced. Arizona said that they weren't, just separated, and Emma noticed she still had the ring on her finger. She remarked that she was obviously seeing other people though, and Arizona said they were. Emma apologized for being so personal, and said that the job interview was more intimate than most rectal exams. \"We don't do things like this at Seattle Pres,\" Emma said, and Arizona then suggested to take the job, as the employees of Grey Sloan Memorial do way too personal on a daily basis.\ua\n\nThat night, Emma waited for Owen outside the hospital. Owen told her that everyone loves her, but Emma said she couldn't work at the hospital. She complimented the people working with him, but she thought that they were his people, who loved and cared about him. Emma said she didn't want to work with her husband again, because if she and Owen would break up, everyone at the hospital would choose him and she would just be the bitch who broke his heart. Owen asked if she was planning on breaking his heart, and she told him she wasn't. He then tried to get her to take the job, but she said she couldn't. She told him not to break her heart either and walked off. ''(\"[[Two Against One]]\")''\n\n\nWhile at GSM to prepare a grant proposal to fund her research, Emma was visited by several of the GSM doctors. One of them was Meredith, who tasted a muffin and, when learning that Emma had made them herself, said she wanted the leftovers if Emma was cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Emma and Owen realized they hadn't made plans for Thanksgiving and Meredith offered Emma the chance to cook at her house, because her kitchen is larger than Owen's and Emma's apartment was being painted. Throughout the course of the day, several others ended up being invited to the dinner, including Cristina. Emma said it was okay with her because Owen had told her he was over her. ''(\"[[Somebody That I Used to Know]]\")''\n\n\nEmma attended April and Matthew's failed wedding with Owen. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n\nAfter dating for several months, Owen and Emma talked about his living situation. He suggested that they move in together and she accepted. However, before they had a chance to choose a place, he cheated on her with Cristina. He broke up with her, but didn't tell her about the cheating. ''(\"[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nEmma seemed to take somewhat of an interest in Owen at the fundraising gala, where she complimented his looks, and later that night, she came to the hospital just to talk to him. ''(\"[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]\")'' After the evening she kept seeing him and even sent him homemade banana bread for work, which caused his colleagues to name her his girlfriend. ''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\nBy the time she came to the hospital to observe a surgery, Emma and Owen were dating. During her visit, she also met Cristina and found out from her about Owen and Cristina's past, which made her realize that Owen wasn't ready to date just yet. ''(\"[[Map of You]]\")'' She said goodbye to Owen, telling him to call her when he was ready to move on, and after some struggle and pondering, he did. ''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\nSome time later, Emma was offered a job at Grey Sloan, but she turned down the offer, not wanting to risk working at the same place with Owen and being left out if something were to happen between them. ''(\"[[Two Against One]]\")''\n\nWhen things between them got serious, Owen and Emma discussed getting a place together. However, later that same day, Cristina came to the trailer drunk and she and Owen slept together. Owen broke up with Emma the next day, saying they wanted different things, but leaving out that he had cheated on her. ''(\"[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]]\")''\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nEver since Emma came to the hospital to observe one of Arizona's teratoma surgeries, she and Arizona formed a good professional relationship. When a position of a [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal surgeon]] became available at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital|Grey Sloan Memorial]], Arizona immediately thought of Emma and pitched her to the board. Arizona really liked her and wanted her to take the job, though Emma eventually decided not to.

One night, after they finished playing, James came and sat down next to Alex, who offered to pay for his drink. James said he recognized Alex, though Alex tried to brush it off as him being at the shows. James then said he remembered him. He's a doctor from the hospital. He said he met a pediatric surgeon on the scariest night of his life, when his son choked on a strawberry. Alex asked where his family was, but James said it's complicated. He then invited Alex to jam.\n\nThey started playing and singing together. James stopped the session to show Alex a picture of his son. Alex was shocked not to see himself, but [[Nicky Evans|Nicky]], a son he had with another woman named Naomi\uaafter leaving Alex's mom.

When he tried to include methadone, Jimmy refused, saying he wanted to get totally clean.\n\nWhen Alex visited his hospital room, Jimmy said he'd recognized Alex as soon as he saw him standing over him at the bar.

During one of his hallucinations, he pushed Jo against the wall and had to be restrained.

Things went south quickly, but Shane refused to call anyone for help. When Leah figured out that Shane wasn't going to stop and Jimmy could die, she ran to get help. She brought back Webber, who managed to get Shane to step back and took over. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\nThree weeks after his surgery, Jimmy was still alive, but struggling. Alex called [[Naomi Evans|Naomi]] and told her Jimmy had died in order to get her to come visit. She came, but was angry to learn Jimmy was still alive. She took the guitar he'd stolen from her and left. Jimmy woke up afterward and saw the guitar missing. He told Alex taking it was one of the lowest things he'd done and he wanted to give it back, not knowing Naomi had come and taken it. When Jimmy started to struggle to breathe, Alex lied to Jimmy and told him Naomi and Nicky were on their way. He said he'd told them Jimmy loved them. He assured him it was okay, that he could go.

He then left, but they never legally divorced.\n\n\nJames had three children with his first wife: Alex, Aaron, and Amber. Though James did drugs, he did have a good relationship with Alex as a child, as he could remember a time he and his oldest son Alex went to a fair with hazardous rides, but they rode each one twice. When Alex grew up, and his father would abuse his mother, he became a wrestler and beat James near to death. After that, James abandoned them.\n\nSometime later on, he had another son, Nicky Evans\uawith\uaanother woman, but he abandoned them, too, when Nicky was five.\n\nWhen he came to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, Alex initially recognized him because of the way James called him Sinatra. He had Jo run a DNA test, which confirmed his suspicions. ''(\"[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]\")'' Alex followed him to a bar, where James and his band played for a couple nights. James talked a little bit about his son, and Alex thought he was talking about himself, but when James showed him a picture of the kid, Alex realized it was Nicky, the child James had with his second wife, whom he later left. Alex becomes enraged and punches him in the face, telling him to never talk to the kid, that he was better off without Jimmy. ''(\"[[Map of You]]\")''\n\nWhen James later returned to the hospital, he started bragging about Alex, telling all the nurses Alex was his son. Alex confronted him about not remembering his own child, but Jimmy said he remembered him. He shared memories with Alex and said he left things better with Naomi and Nicky and might be able to go back. Alex made his peace with Jimmy, saying he was better off without Jimmy, but wished him luck patching things up with Nicky.

April went to do a more thorough exam and Jennifer admitted she was pregnant, so April had Arizona paged. She hadn't had any prenatal care for her pregnancy.

After Tyler's surgery, Lauren asked Arizona to show her to an on-call room, so she could sleep nearby the first night after surgery. However, once they were in the room and Arizona tried to say goodbye, the power went out and they began to kiss. Arizona initially pulled away, reiterating that she's married. But Lauren told her that she is allowed to lose a little bit of control and Arizona leaned back in and they started to kiss again. ''(\"[[Readiness is All]]\")''\n\nAfter the power came back on in the hospital, Callie came to find Arizona and saw Arizona talking to Lauren. She noticed that Arizona's wedding ring was pinned to the scrub top Lauren was wearing. Despite Lauren coming up with a lie, Callie figured out what had happened. ''(\"[[Perfect Storm]]\")''\n\n\nDespite being told by Arizona to stay in the on-call room, Lauren came back to the NICU, where only two nurses had made it in for their shifts, leaving them understaffed. Lauren helped bag and manually ventilate the babies in the NICU. ''(\"[[Perfect Storm]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the storm ended, the airport reopened and Jackson put her in a cab so she could catch her plane.\ua''(\"[[Seal Our Fate]]\")''\n\n\nDuring her brief time at Grey Sloan Memorial, she displayed a playful, flirty disposition, openly flirting with Arizona. She was also highly encouraging toward Jackson. She took a collaborative approach to the surgical case, allowing Arizona to take a part of the surgery and encouraging Jackson to take another part. Jackson remarked that Lauren was similar to Mark in her ability to mentor in a way that made him feel capable. She openly admitted to being a control freak, but sees this as a positive quality.\n\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nWhen she arrived at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], she took an immediate liking to Arizona and flirted with her. Despite learning via Google search that Arizona was married and had lost her leg, she continued to pursue Arizona. After the surgery on Tyler is completed, she asks Arizona to show her an [[On-Call Room|on-call room]]. She and Arizona have sex. After a stressful day in the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]], Lauren told Arizona she had feelings for her, saying, \"I'm not just gonna leave things like this... I like you. A lot.\" However, Arizona told Lauren that she had made a mistake, effectively ending their relationship, even before Callie finds out.\n\n\nDr. Lauren Boswell is a [[Board Certification|board certified]] [[Plastic Surgery|plastic surgeon]] specializing in [[Craniofacial Surgery|craniofacial surgery]].

They worried about how they would choose until Alex stepped in and said that they wouldn't have to choose; he'd be making the choice. He ran tests and compared their conditions, but the twins came out tied, so he decided that he needed to open both of them up and look directly at their tumors before he could make the choice.

Whether she meant it or not, she started an arms race with the restraining order. April said she wanted to take it back, but Lucinda advised her not to talk to Jackson and to let the order stand. She just wanted to keep her baby safe. Lucinda said they could use her feeling that her baby was in danger.

Arizona said she was sure. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\n\nLucinda and Callie's lawyer, [[Michelle Carpio]], tried to mediate over the phone. However, they were unable to reach a peaceful agreement, so they were forced to take it to court.\n\n\nThe case went to court, with [[Madeline Kane]] presiding.\n\nFirst, Michelle questioned Owen about his work with Callie on the veterans. He said Callie was a very empathetic person. He said he didn't feel the move was sudden for Callie, because when she's presented with a challenge, she faces it.\n\nThe next person called was Andrew, who talked about living with Sofia and Arizona. He said Sofia made the house happy.\n\nAfter Andrew, Penny was called. She was asked if she loved Sofia. She said she did, despite only knowing her for a few months. Despite not being able to recall what grade Sofia was in or what she'd been wearing that morning, she demonstrated knowledge of Sofia's likes and dislikes.\n\nMichelle questioned Bailey about the differences between Arizona and Callie's work and their schedules. She presented documentation that Arizona did more emergency surgeries in the past six months than Callie had. Bailey questioned if Michelle would ask about it if Arizona were a man. Bailey said every emergency surgery was Arizona saving someone else's baby.\n\nThe next day, Michelle questioned Meredith about Sofia's friendship with Zola and her relationship to Penny. She said Sofia loves Penny. She takes easily to people if they're good people. Lucinda then questioned her about Meredith and Callie helping each other out. Lucinda emphasized that Callie had a support system in Seattle.\n\nNext, Lucinda talked to Richard about his relationship with Arizona. He said Sofia would be lucky to have her as a role model parent. Michelle then questioned him about their trivia nights. She found documentation from the bar that said they'd won trivia night  times in the last six months.  nights Arizona was out with him, away from Sofia. Richard said he didn't know where Sofia was during those nights. Michelle presented transcripts of text messages between Callie and Arizona showing  times Arizona asked Callie to switch days with Sofia. Lucinda requested a recess.\n\nLucinda and Arizona talked about how they'd slut shamed her in the courtroom. Lucinda said Arizona needed to set the record straight. She assured Arizona she'd win if she told the truth.\n\nMichelle questioned Callie about the day Sofia was born. She talked about the accident and how she wanted to give up, but couldn't because she was pregnant with Sofia at the time. She said being a mother was the reason she's alive today.\n\nFinally, Michelle questioned Arizona about the circumstances of Sofia's conception in relation to her relationship with Callie. She insinuated that Arizona had come around later. Arizona said she legally adopted Sofia and that when the time had come to make a choice, she had chosen motherhood and it was the best choice she ever made. During this time, her phone started ringing repeatedly. She told the judge she was a doctor and needed to check her phone. When she saw it was a patient emergency, she apologized, but said she needed to leave. She loved Sofia and wanted her with her, but she knew that no matter what happened, Sofia would he happy and healthy and loved and cared for because she and Callie are her mothers. But there was a kid at the hospital who wouldn't be okay without her, so she needed to go to the hospital to save that kid.\n\nThe hearing ended with Arizona being awarded full custody of Sofia.

She did an ultrasound and showed Callie, [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], and [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] the yolk sac. Callie was concerned because she was bleeding, but Lucy assured her that that's common. She agreed to run some tests, but told Callie just to live her life. However, Callie refused to leave the exam room until Lucy ruled out everything. Lucy ended up bringing up a stronger ultrasound machine, which allowed the three parents to hear the heartbeat. ''(\"[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]]\")''\n\nShe did a second ultrasound on Callie later and asked if they'd scheduled an amniocentesis, which prompted a debate between the three parents over whether or not they needed one. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\nLucy did a third ultrasound at . weeks. She said everything looked good, but Callie's blood pressure was just a little high, though she said it was due to the nerves about her baby shower. She then invited Lucy to the baby shower. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Alex came to the NICU looking for a brain dead infant whom the transplant coordinator had suggested as a potential donor for his patient, who had hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, he butted head with Lucy, who banned him from the NICU over his comments. She later saw him talking to his patient's parents in the NICU and wanted to go kick him out, but Arizona told her that Alex is a good guy and a good doctor, even if he can be an ass sometimes. ''(\"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Lucy found out that Alex needed to sign his delinquent charts to get out of the hospital in time for a basketball game, she helped him get through the charts because she didn't want him to miss the game. After they were finished, he asked her to go to the game with him, but she declined. She later watched from the gallery as he skipped the game to treat a four year old. ''(\"[[Golden Hour]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith's vision started to become blurry due to her fertility medications, Alex came and talked to Lucy about it. She correctly figured out that he was just looking for an excuse to talk to her, because if Meredith were really concerned, she'd come to Lucy herself. When Meredith's condition worsened, she did come to Lucy, who examined her and told her to stop taking the drugs immediately and got a consult from an ophthalmologist. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\n\nLucy came to Callie's baby shower, where she noticed that Alex was stealing party food and asked him about it. Later, she asked Meredith about Alex and she told Lucy about some of the things Alex had been through, saying the neanderthal act was just a front. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Callie and Arizona were a car accident when Callie was . weeks pregnant, Lucy was called in to monitor the pregnancy as they worked on Callie. She was able to find a fetal heartbeat in the ER, but when she admitted that she was out of her depth, they called in [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. Lucy was embarrassed at having been benched. ''(\"[[Song Beneath the Song]]\")''\n\n\nLucy was supposed to go to Callie and Arizona's wedding as Alex's date, but a baby she was delivering got stuck and so she couldn't make it. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\n\nShe got a job over  other applicants at Baylor in Texas. She was hesitant to take it, thinking about spending another year in Seattle. She mentioned there were a lot of factors to consider before taking the job, implicitly saying her relationship with Alex was one of the reasons. In surgery, Arizona mentioned to Alex that a doctor was needed to take over for her at the Namboze Clinic, and that he was qualified to do it. Lucy overheard the offer and got interested. Upon hearing Alex was interested too, she found out that she wasn't a factor that he took into consideration. After a talk with Arizona, Alex realized that he loved Lucy and that she was an important factor. By that time, Lucy had already taken the job at Namboze, stating career comes first. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\nLucy was part of the team of doctors to tend to victims of a plane crash. However, all but one died in the crash, so she delivered the news of their deaths to several victims' families. At the end of the day, she went to look for Alex at Joe's bar and asked him to tell her not to go to Africa. Feeling bad over getting Meredith fired, he was drinking and simply told her to go to hell.\ua''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina realized she hadn't had a period in a while, she went to Lucy, who did an ultrasound and said it looked like she was about six weeks pregnant. She asked if Cristina wanted to talk about options, but Cristina said she didn't. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex met Lucy in the NICU, but thought she was a nurse. He asked her to pass him a chart on \"a turnip\" in the nursery. She was upset by this and he told her he had a baby that needed a heart transplant, and the transplant coordinator suggested \"the turnip\" as a potential donor. She then told him she delivered the baby and she'd be in touch with the transplant coordinator and then told Alex to leave.\n\nLater, Alex noticed Dr. Fields, Teddy, Arizona, and Cristina talking to the parents so he walked in and tried to join. Afterward, he asked Arizona why he wasn't brought in earlier and Lucy told him he was off the case because of the \"turnip\" comment. Alex and Lucy watched the heart transplant from the gallery. He explained that he was sorry for what he said, but felt he deserved to be in the surgery. Lucy watched Alex standing over the heart transplant baby and smiling with the baby's parents. Arizona told Lucy she could teach Alex not to be an ass, but she didn't have to teach him to care.\n\nAt the end of the night, Alex and Lucy were in the elevator together, not speaking. Alex finally told her he was sorry about her patient. She said she was happy for his. As they walked out, he started to ask if she wanted \"to get a --,\" but she cut him off and said no. ''(\"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\")''\n\nWhen she heard about that Alex had charts to finish before he could go to a basketball game, she sat down to help him because she agreed he couldn't miss the game. In the end, she talked him into asking her and then claimed it was all just so she could see if he'd ask her to the game. ''(\"[[Golden Hour]]\")''\n\nWhen he came to her to get help with Meredith's vision, she correctly figured out that he was just trying to get a second chance with her, but couldn't just ask her out again after being rejected. He then asked her out, but was rejected a second time. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Lucy and Alex at Callie and Arizona's baby shower]]\nThey talked again at Callie and Arizona's baby shower, where she noticed him stealing food. She asked Meredith about him and she said there's more to Alex than it seems and told Lucy about what he'd been through. At the end of the night, she joined him in his trailer in the parking lot for a drink. She figured out that he had been waiting for her. Alex tried to defend himself, but she kissed him. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\nShe was supposed to go to Callie and Arizona's wedding with Alex, but she got stuck delivering a baby. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship ended when, believing Alex didn't consider her a factor in his decision of whether or not to take the job at Namboze, Lucy stepped in and took the job herself. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\n\nAfter graduating [[Harvard Medical School]], Lucy completed an [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Duke University Medical Center]]. Lucy decided to complete her [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]\uato gain OB-related trauma cases.\ua\n\nWhile at Seattle Grace Mercy West, Lucy did the initial exam and ultrasound for [[Callie Torres|Callie]] when she was pregnant with [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]]. Although the case was relatively boring for a maternal-fetal fellow, [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] convinced Lucy to be Callie's OB. Lucy was also the go-to OB consult for emergent patients.\n\nNear the end of her fellowship, Lucy applied for and was accepted into a program at Baylor in Texas. She considered staying another year at Seattle Grace Mercy West, but ultimately chose to work at Namboze Clinic as its director, taking over Arizona's old position. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\n\n*Although an [[Attending|attending]] in [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]], Lucy wore navy scrubs because she was a sub-specialist OB, undergoing a [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal]] [[Fellow|fellowship]].\n*As an attending, Lucy had a personalized scrub cap.\n*In a deleted scene of [[Song Beneath the Song]], she confesses to [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] that she came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] because she idolized Addison's career and would like to, one day, be her.\n*It is likely that the program she got into Baylor was a [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] as that would have given her the experience to adequately handle fetal trauma cases, given her [[Song Beneath the Song|inexperience]]. Furthermore, Baylor, in the real world, does offer a fetal surgery fellowship.\n*She is a basketball fan.<ref>[[Golden Hour]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxLucyFields.png|[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]]\nxLucyFields.png|[[P.Y.T.

While Morgan was optimistic about the baby's odds, Chris was very pessimistic, pointing out that he only had a % chance of survival. When Arizona asked them about how aggressive they wanted to be with their treatment, Morgan wanted to be aggressive, but Chris wanted to stop. She eventually gave Chris an out, which he took, leaving Morgan alone to support Tommy. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\nMorgan was worried when Tommy developed a brain bleed and needed surgery for his heart. However, the surgery went well despite his bleed worsening and he was stable in the NICU afterward. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\nTommy's condition continued to deteriorate and Morgan had to make a decision again for whether or not she wanted to continue care. She went to Alex for advice, but he felt that they were getting too close, so he had himself taken off the page. Morgan decided to have Arizona operate again despite Tommy's poor prognosis. However, she requested that Alex not be a part of the surgical team. ''(\"[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]\")''\n\nWhen almost all of Tommy's bowel died, Arizona told Morgan that it was time to say goodbye. Alex disconnected all of Tommy's machines and allowed Morgan to hold him and sat with her while he died. After he stopped breathing, she became upset and cried, saying she wasn't ready yet. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe had a boyfriend, [[Chris (If Only You Were Lonely)|Chris]], but they broke up when he decided to leave their premature son to go back to his job in Cleveland. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\n\nMorgan bonded with Alex while he was treating her son. He stayed with her overnight and she quizzed him to prepare for his board. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\nWhile he was working on Tommy's case, Alex Karev became close to Morgan, to the point where he took himself off Tommy's case because he was worried that Morgan was getting too close to him. ''(\"[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]\")''\n\nHe later left his boards to come back to [[Seattle]] so he could sit with Morgan as she held Tommy while he died.

Take over, do well, make me not regret it. Can you do that? Please?|'''Nicole Herman''' to '''[[Arizona Robbins]]'''}}\n\n'''Nicole Herman''' was the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Fetal Surgery]]\uaat [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\n\nDr. Nicole Herman was first seen when she talked to Arizona about a shared patient. She repaired the U.T.O. at  weeks and when she went to check on the baby, the parents could not stop singing the praises of Arizona, while she only did a few little stitches when the baby hit the air. Nicole brought up the open fellowship spot and suggested that Arizona should apply so that she could learn something that's actually hard, rather than taking the credit for other people's hard work. Arizona objected that she too did really hard things in peds, but Nicole wasn't convinced.\ua''(\"[[I Must Have Lost It on the Wind]]\")''\n\nWhen Arizona started her fellowship, Nicole immediately began assigning extra research and work to her. When she struggled to keep up, Nicole reminded her that everything in the womb happens at super-speed, so she needs to learn to keep up. ''(\"[[Got to Be Real]]\")''\n\nNicole continued teaching Arizona and an OB/GYN resident,\ua[[Graham Maddox|Dr. Graham Maddox]],\uain a very strict and severe manner. She noted Arizona's impeccable record and good relationship with her peers, but treated her strictly as her fellow, for example not letting her join in on a personal conversation. She granted Arizona the chance to perform a solo fetal surgery, but upon noticing Arizona wasn't as well prepared as she expected her to be, she gave the opportunity to Graham. She later took Arizona aside and informed her that she was letting her down, causing her to start doubting Arizona's operating skills and even her own teaching skills. Herman told her that if she messed up again, she would fire her as her fellow as she did not have the time to wait for Arizona to catch up.\ua''(\"[[Bend & Break]]\")''\n\n\nNicole told Arizona that she had an inoperable brain tumor and only had six months left to live. She wanted to use this period of time to teach Arizona about Fetal Surgery since it is a new field and all the knowledge she held wasn't found in any textbooks. ''(\"[[Don't Let's Start]]\")''\n\nAfter telling Arizona about the tumor, she left it up to Arizona to decide if she wanted to continue to learn from her or if she wanted to turn her into the board, which would mean that the fellowship would go away. While Arizona was trying to decide, Herman left her in charge of the department as she had an appointment. At the end of the day, Herman returned to the hospital. She noted that Arizona had done exactly what she should have done in Herman's absence and confessed that she'd been getting radiation therapy. After this, Arizona agreed that she wouldn't tell the rest of the board and would continue to learn from Herman. ''(\"[[Could We Start Again, Please?]]\")''\n\nWhen Amelia informed her that she believed she could remove the tumor, Herman initially rejected the idea, because she'd been given hope many times before and then had it taken away. However, after Arizona confronted her and said that she was throwing away a chance that [[April Kepner|April]] and [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] would love to have for their baby, she relented and agreed to hear Amelia's plan. After hearing it, she agreed to have the surgery, but only after the tumor grew as large as it could get and still be removed in its entirety. She insisted on that even when Amelia insisted that it needed to be removed as soon as possible. ''(\"[[Where Do We Go From Here]]\")''\n\nWhile Amelia developed her surgical plan, Herman created an intense crash course intended to teach Arizona as much as possible in the time they had left. ''(\"[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]]\")''\n\nHerman and Arizona continued their crash course over the next four weeks. However, earlier than they expected, Herman started to experience fuzziness at the edges of her vision. An MRI revealed that the tumor had invaded her optic chiasm, meaning it was time for her surgery. She was taken immediately to the OR and sedated for surgery. ''(\"[[Staring at the End]]\")''\n\nAmelia operated and despite some complications, she successfully removed Nicole's tumor. However, she didn't wake up for several days after the surgery, leading Amelia to look for a cause. An MRI showed signs of a stroke and Amelia worried she'd never wake up. Despite this, she did eventually wake up. She was fully aware of her surroundings and showed no loss of mental faculties, but she was completely blind. She told Arizona that she was grateful that she got to figure out what was next for her because Arizona pushed so hard to get her to have the surgery. ''(\"[[The Distance]]\")''\n\n\nAfter being discharged from the hospital, Herman went to the Blind Institute, where she learned to live her daily life as a blind person. She sent Arizona a text that said, \"Enjoying Blind Institute. Learning how to not bump into things. Not typing this obvi. Don't kill any babies.\" ''(\"[[I Feel the Earth Move]]\")''\n\nAfter finishing \"Blind School,\" Nicole went dark over the loss of her ability to do surgery, to save lives. Then she looked at all the things Arizona was doing and realized she could teach and that could matter. She could save even more babies that way. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\nNicole returned to Seattle when she had a series of headaches over a month. Amelia worried that her tumor had returned, even after a CT looked clear. However, she ordered a spinal tap to rule out CSF leak. After the tap instead confirmed it, Amelia said she'd need a shunt, but Amelia didn't want to do the surgery herself, because she had operated on Nicole before under the influence of a tumor. Nicole revealed that she knew about the tumor because of [[Tom Koracick]] and still wanted Amelia to do the surgery. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\n\nEx-Husband\nShe was married but is now divorced. She mentions that while they were married, she was involved in many boards and committees, things that were important to him. She quit all that later because it wasn't important to her.\n\n[[Tom Koracick]]\nAfter becoming blind, she had sex with Tom. She said that sex when you're blind is even better. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nShe seems to have had a rather close professional relationship with Arizona Robbins, teasing her about the fact that fetal surgery is even harder than pediatric surgery.\n\nHowever, when they began working together more closely, they bonded and became more friendly, with Arizona even spending several nights in the hospital with Herman, who was staying there during their crash course.\n\nAfter Nicole left to go to what she called \"Blind School,\" she lost contact with Arizona, though she continued to follow Arizona's professional work. They made up when Nicole returned to the hospital and offered to use her grant money to open a center for women's health with Arizona. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nShe and Amelia were shown discussing [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Dr. Addison Montgomery]]'s new life as a mother, indicating they know each other both personally and professionally. Both practice the surgical specialty of [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]] and are renowned in [[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]].\n\n[[Graham Maddox]]\nWhile he was rounding on her service, she started a sexual relationship with Graham. She said he was a nominal surgeon and a complete tool, but was a satisfactory sexual partner.\n\n\nDr. Nicole Herman was the\ua[[Attending#Department Head|Head]]\uaof\ua[[Fetal Surgery]]\uaat\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. After an\ua[[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]]\ua[[Resident|residency]], she completed a\ua[[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]]\ua[[Fellow|fellowship]]\uaand eventually sub-specialized in\ua[[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgery]], a brand new field of medicine that she's basically inventing as she operates.\n\nOne of the few fetal surgeons in America, Nicole trained\ua[[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]]\uaas her fetal fellow, and\uaOB/GYN resident [[Graham Maddox|Dr. Graham Maddox]] who regularly rounded\uaon her service. Her excellent reputation as a fetal surgeon\uamade [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] the go-to hospital for fetal surgeries in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAfter she became blind following the surgery to remove her brain tumor, Nicole was left unable to operate and resigned.\n\nAfter leaving surgery, she got a faculty position at UCSF, teaching fetal surgery. She got a grant from HHS and decided to use it to open a center for women's health along with Arizona, saying she could teach and Arizona could perform fetal surgery and make the country safer for women and babies. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\n*She is the first known\ua[[Fetal Surgery|fetal surgeon]]\uawho's part of the staff of Grey Sloan Memorial.

Because he had trouble keeping up with the other interns, [[Alex Karev]], his resident, tried to dump him in the clinic, but they ended up working on the case together. [[Hunter Chapman]] came in with his mother, who suspected he was doing drugs. Norman sided with the mother, who insisted on a drug test. He later tried to get Alex to stop to explain a procedure to his mother before he did it. Afterward, Alex went to apologize to him, but Bailey told him not to apologize because he was an intern and he got in the way. He needed to learn his place. ''(\"[[Let the Truth Sting]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith and Norman were doing labs and discharges. They had a patient who was being discharged to hospice, so Meredith taught him the protocol for telling patients they were dying. They then went to [[Gretchen Bitzer]] to tell her that she was dying. She and Norman both cried. When they found out that Gretchen wasn't actually dying, they had to track her down because she left the hospital. Norman found her and brought her back. When [[Mark Sloan]] said he was planning to write up both Norman and Meredith, Meredith said that Norman was only an intern and she should be the only one written up. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nNorman came to Alex and said he was feeling under the weather. He wanted to go home, but Alex said he needed to suck it up if he wanted to be a surgeon. When Alex saw that Rebecca was back in town, he dismissed Norman to do his own thing. While Norman was helping with [[James Miller]], he started to feel queasy, but he thought it was because of the blood. Later, while in surgery, he collapsed. He'd had a stroke and was taken into surgery to remove the clot. After the clot was out, Norman woke up, confused. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n\nAfter his surgery, he told Alex that he'd wanted to go into psych, but he had a voice in his head telling him to go into surgery. After his stroke, he figured that his wife wanted him to be surrounded by surgeons when he had his stroke. He decided to transfer to psych because he believed the surgeons could all use a good shrink. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n\n\nNorman married Mary-Beth Shales and they had four children. According to him, when one of their children was straying from a good path, she knew right away. When Mary-Beth appeared to him in a dream, he made the decision to go into surgery instead of psych.\n\n\nDr. Shales was a pharmacist for thirty years. He was transferred from UCLA as an [[Internship|intern]], and assigned to [[Alex Karev|Dr. Alex Karev]] at Seattle Grace Hospital in the [[General Surgery|surgical program]]. Because of his age, he was often mistaken by patients as the senior doctor. He collapsed in surgery because of a stroke (causing [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Shepherd]] to operate and remove the clot). He believes that it was his wife watching over him that allowed him to be treated by some of the best surgeons in the world at the time of his stroke. He transferred and became an intern in [[Psychiatry|psych]].\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nNormanShales.png|[[Let the Truth Sting]]\nNormanShales.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\nNormanShales.png|[[Haunt You Every Day]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Norman Shales Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Norman Shales]]\n[[fr:Norman Shales]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shales, Norman}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Robert began to search rabidly for water, even drinking from the toilet. They had to turn the water off in his room to get him to stop.

On his first day, he did a liver transplant on [[Lisa Collis]], a four month old with biliary atresia. He was unable to close because of the swelling. [[Alex Karev]] had the idea to use a sterilized ping pong ball to hold the place, which was safer than a sponge because there was little risk for infection and her liver would just grow around it. Alex presented the idea to Stark, who rejected it, saying that he'd asked Alex to take care of his post-ops and not \"play with balls!\" However, Alex later found out that Stark had taken Lisa into surgery and was claiming credit for the idea. The surgery was successful. ''(\"[[Something's Gotta Give]]\")''\n\n\nStark left [[Meredith Grey]] in charge of his patients overnight while he went out. When [[Drew McNeil]] had severe post-op pain, Meredith paged him, but he quickly dismissed the pain as gas and left. When a CT revealed a perforated ulcer, Meredith paged Stark again, but he didn't answer his pages, so they took Drew into surgery without him. When he found out what they had done, he yelled at them, saying he would have taken the heat if something had gone wrong. ''(\"[[Slow Night, So Long]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Jared Swork]] opened fire on Pacific College, he shot Kelly Keck, a  year old. Stark took her into surgery. Because of her injuries, he believed amputating her leg was the safest option. However, [[Alex Karev]] believed that [[Callie Torres]] could save the leg, so he called to [[Arizona Robbins]], who was watching from the gallery, for support. She had Alex physically stop Stark while she went to get operating privileges and Callie to save the leg. When she returned and took over, Stark was shocked and left the OR in disbelief. He complained to Webber about it, but Webber told him to go save a life. When the doctors later all started to laugh after learning no one had died in the shooting, he was incredulous and declared that he hated the hospital. ''(\"[[Disarm]]\")''\n\n\nStark started to get close with April after they worked on the case of [[Kyle Baker]], a ten year old with a cystic hygroma that was nearly cutting off his airway. Stark wanted to call child protective services on the parents because they let it get so bad, but April figured out a compromise, which involved Kyle coming in regularly for exams, which April agreed to do personally. He later invited her to have dinner with him. After thinking about it, she accepted. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\nHe continued to work closely with April as they socialized outside of work. This came to a head when he invited her to come watch a movie at his house and her fellow residents convinced her that he was expecting sex. She panicked and cancelled their date. He realized what was happening and they ended things because she thought of him as a friend and he didn't want to be just her friend. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\nAfter that conversation, he started to ignore her and insisted that she call him Dr. Stark instead of Robert. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]] was born extremely prematurely, Callie was unable to see her. Cristina went to Stark to ask about it, but he said that Sofia wasn't stable enough to move, so he forced her to wait.\n\nBecause of her prematurity, Sofia's PDA hadn't closed by the time she was five weeks old. Despite [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona's]] attempts to get another pediatric surgeon to operate, she was unable to find one. Stark therefore operated and allowed Arizona to be in the OR to watch. However, Arizona was unable to handle it when Sofia started to bleed out. After Arizona left the OR suddenly, Stark was able to save her and finish the surgery. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Alex had the idea to bring several African patients to Seattle to have surgery, he made a presentation to Stark in order to get funding to pay for the project. However, Stark refused. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the African children started arriving in Seattle for their surgeries, he worked on the case of [[Asha]] with April and Owen. He became frustrated when April focused more on Asha and how scared she was than the medicine. He later found her making porridge in the hopes that she'd be able to get Asha to eat something. He scolded her for it, but later endorsed her as a potential Chief Resident to Owen. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nAfter working together on [[Kyle Baker]], Stark was impressed that April had convinced him to change his mind and asked her out on a date as a result. She took some time to think about it, but accepted his invitation. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\nThey had several outings together when one time, April said she'd have to cancel because she wasn't sure when she'd get out of the hospital, so he suggested that she just come to his house, where they'd watch a movie and have dinner. When the other residents convinced her he wanted to have sex with her, she backed out. He figured out that she wanted to break things off with her, citing the age difference. She clarified that she thought of them as more like friends, but he said he didn't want her to be just his friend. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\nAfter that conversation, he started to ignore her. When she said she wished other people could get to know the Robert she knew, he simply said that she should call him Dr. Stark. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\nWhile working on [[Asha]], April confronted Stark about ignoring her, but he insisted that he was treating her just like any other resident. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\n\nUnder contract for a year, Stark served as the department [[Attending#Department Head|head]] even after Robbins returned. Described as a lazy doctor and a complacent and self-satisfied attending, Stark represented the antithesis of attending surgeons commonly employed at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. Stark had an antagonistic disposition with most of the hospital staff.\n\nUpon his arrival, he formed a negative relationship with [[Alex Karev]] when he refused to consider using Alex's idea for a liver transplant. Alex later discovered Stark used the idea, but said it was his own. This negative relationship was reinforced when Stark insisted on amputating a teenage girl's leg unnecessarily. Karev body blocked Stark from the leg while [[Arizona Robbins]] went to get her privileges reinstated. When she returned, she kicked Stark out of the OR, and she and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] were able to save the leg. This showed that he values being right and doing things his way over helping a child.

Okay? I can't have one that's hurt. I just can't handle it. My mom doesn't even talk to me. I'm doing this alone.|'''Sloan''' talking to '''[[Mark Sloan|Mark]]''' about her baby.}}\n\n'''Sloan Riley''' is the daughter of [[Mark Sloan]].\n\n\n\nWhen she was  years old, Sloan became pregnant. Her mother was very angry with her and kicked her out of the house. Sloan then decided to fly to Seattle to meet her biological father, as he was the only person she could go to. At first, she kept her pregnancy a secret from him and Lexie, but when she felt that they were about to kick her out of their apartment as well, she revealed her secret. Mark then decided to let Sloan stay with him and Lexie. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Lexie did an ultrasound, she found out there was something wrong with Sloan's baby. He had bands of amniotic tissue around his legs. She thought she was wrong at first and took Sloan to OB where\ua[[Elizabeth Chen]]\uaagreed with her that something was wrong. She also informed Sloan that her baby was a male.\uaMark was so worried about his daughter and grandson that he immediately flew Addison to Seattle.\n\nArizona was called in as well, giving Sloan two options. She could either let Addison operate on her baby in utero, or she could wait, give birth, and let Arizona fix the problem after having given birth, rehabbing the remaining part of his leg and fitting him with prosthetics. Together with Mark, Sloan decided to let Addison operate on her. However, during surgery, Addison revealed to Mark she would have to go in the womb between two engorged uterine arteries, which was very difficult.\uaMark forced Addison to stop the surgery right away, as he was too worried something could go wrong. After surgery, Sloan was worried about the baby not having a leg, so Lexie suggested that they fly to Los Angeles to let Addison operate again and finish the surgery. ''(\"[[Blink]]\")''\n\n\nLexie persuaded them to fly to Los Angeles to let Addison finish the surgery.\n\nWhen Sloan's blood pressure went up rapidly, Pete used acupuncture to get it back down. While Addison was operating, the AVM blew, but Addison opened and was able to save her and the baby. When she woke up, Sloan asked of her mother. Saying she wanted her life back and didn't want a baby. Addison talked to Sloan about adoption. ''(\"[[Another Second Chance]]\")''\n\n\nSloan returned to Seattle after she recovered from her surgery. She came to the hospital in order to get an ultrasound. She asked for an official form declaring the baby healthy, which she needed because she planned to give him up for adoption. [[Callie Torres]] gave her the form, but insisted that Sloan tell Mark about the adoption. He was upset and convinced her to keep the baby and give the baby to him to raise. She agreed, but later left without telling him, telling Callie she needed him to be someone else's baby. ''(\"[[Valentine's Day Massacre]]\")''\n\n\nSloan came back to Mark's apartment late at night in labor. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\")''\n\nShe delivered the baby with the help of [[Teddy Altman]]. The baby made no sounds initially, but started to cry after being stimulated by [[Arizona Robbins]]. They were then taken to the hospital, where Sloan was shocked to learn that she'd only be there for one day. She had purchased several small trinkets for the baby, many of which were choking hazards. She gave Mark the number to call [[Trish]] and [[Keith (Hook, Line and Sinner)|Keith]], the parents she'd chosen. When he hesitated, Arizona offered to make the call, but Mark said he could handle it. Sloan wondered where she'd go after she was discharged, so Mark offered to let her stay with him. She then suggested that maybe they keep the baby. Arizona tried to convince Mark to call the parents Sloan had picked, but he refused. However, when Sloan struggled to feed the baby, even with their help, Callie talked to Mark and reminded him that she was young and her instincts had led her to put the baby up for adoption. Mark called Sloan's mother and said she was coming to get Sloan and missed her. He told her that if ''she'' decided she wanted to keep the baby, he was all in, but not to keep the baby because of him because she'll always have him no matter what. ''(\"[[Hook, Line and Sinner]]\")''\n\n\nShe is described as intensely vapid and rude. She even went so far as to call her own father an old perv.\n\n\n\nMark Sloan is her father. He had a relationship with her mother, Samantha, when they were young. Samantha got pregnant and Mark gave her some money and assumed she used it to have an abortion, so he was shocked when Sloan showed up  years later looking for him. She looked for him because Samantha had kicked her out when she found out Sloan was pregnant.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Holidaze]]\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Blink]]\nPPSloanRiley.png|[[Another Second Chance]]\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Valentine's Day Massacre]]\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\nxSloanRiley.png|[[Hook, Line and Sinner]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg  \nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Sloan Riley Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Sloan Riley]]\n[[fr:Sloan Riley]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riley, Sloan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (CAM)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

However, her lack of enthusiasm caused Arizona to end their relationship in the airport and leave without her. ''(\"[[That's Me Trying]]\")''\n\nA heartbroken Callie moved in with Mark and they had a short fling. ''(\"[[Something's Gotta Give]]\")'' Arizona returned for Callie, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness. ''(\"[[Adrift and at Peace]]\")''\n\nCallie initially rebuffed her and later revealed that she was pregnant with Mark's baby. ''(\"[[Start Me Up]]\")'' Arizona agreed to raise the child with her, but disliked that Mark would be a permanent part of their lives. ''(\"[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]]\")''\n\nWhen Callie was twenty-three and a half weeks pregnant, she planned a getaway-weekend to thank Arizona for her support.\n\nEn route, Arizona proposed to her, but before Callie could respond, they crashed into a truck. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\n\nSofia was delivered by C-section during Callie's second surgery following the crash. [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], Callie's very good friend, returned from Los Angeles to deliver the baby after [[Lucy Fields]] admitted that the care Callie needed was beyond her abilities.\n\nSofia was delivered  weeks early without a heartbeat, weighing just  pound and  ounce. Arizona was able to resuscitate her and she was placed in an incubator as her lungs and other internal organs hadn't fully matured. She was then taken to the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]] and was on a ventilator, as she was unable to breathe on her own. ''(\"[[Song Beneath the Song]]\")''\n[[File:Baby_sofia_new.jpg|thumb|Sofia at one week old]]\n\nAt one week old, Sofia was able to move her hand around and opened her eyes for the first time. She had a brain bleed, but it was minor.\n\n[[File:Baby_sofia_.jpg|thumb|left|Callie holding Sofia.]] \nAt  weeks old, Sofia was in heart failure and required surgery to close her PDA, which [[Robert Stark|Dr. Stark]] performed. He allowed Arizona to be in the OR as she is not biologically related to Sofia and it was not a legal issue for the hospital. During the surgery, Sofia started to bleed out which caused a devastated Arizona to run out of the OR. However, Dr. Stark was able to find the bleeder and repair it and Sofia was stable.\n\nTwelve weeks after the accident, Callie was discharged from the hospital, but reluctant to leave[[File:Baby_sofia_.jpg|thumb|Sofia, Callie, and Arizona going home for the first time after her birth.]] unless Sofia could leave with her. Stark eased Callie's tension by saying Sofia could be discharged if she passed the infant carrier test. She passed, but Callie was scared to take her home because of the dangers of cars. [[Miranda Bailey]] calmed her down and Callie, Mark, Arizona, and Sofia left the hospital. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nWhile playing at a friend's house, Sofia tripped and her head hit a rock, cutting her. Her friend's mom, [[Tori]], brought her to the ER, where [[Penelope Blake|Penny]] stitched up her head. After she was discharged, she and Callie agreed that only ice cream could make her head better and they invited Penny to come along. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Callie wanted to move to New York with Penny and wanted to take Sofia with her, Arizona sued for custody. During the hearing, Sofia stayed with [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] at [[Meredith's House]]. When the trial concluded with Arizona being awarded full custody, they went home together at the end of the day. ''(\"[[Mama Tried]]\")''\n\nDespite this ruling, Arizona agreed to new terms after Sofia kept asking her why Callie was so sad. She gave Callie plane tickets to New York for Callie and Sofia and said she wanted Sofia for the summer and every other school year, plus every other Christmas, but they could work out the details. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\n\nArizona helped her settle in at Callie and Penny's new place, where Sofia has her own room. The place is right near the park and Sofia loved her new school. ''(\"[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]]\")''\n\nHowever, several months later, she sent Arizona a text saying that she wanted to move back to Seattle. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she moved back to Seattle, Sofia told Arizona that she wanted her room to be green, but Arizona couldn't decide which shade, so she told Sofia she could decide herself and they'd paint it together. She also surprised Sofia with three different flavors of ice cream. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her return to Seattle, Sofia refused to go to school. She said she wanted to go back to New York with her friends and the teacher who let them draw on their notebooks. Instead of making her go to school, Arizona took Sofia to work with her, where Sofia met [[Noah Brosniak]], the son of a patient, and the two played together while Arizona examined Noah's mom.\n\nNoah was diagnosed with a brain tumor and when Arizona tucked Sofia in that night, she cried because she realized she was so lucky to have a healthy, smart girl and she was sometimes too busy to understand that. She suggested that she take the next day off and take Sofia to find an adventure. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\nAfter this incident, Sofia continued to refuse to go to school. Arizona had to bribe her in order to get her to go to school. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\n\nSofia was suspended from school for stealing the field trip money from her class. Arizona took her to work and put her in the day care for the day. Then she learned from reading Sofia's diary that she stole the money to buy a plane ticket to New York and didn't want to tell Arizona because she worried about hurting her feelings. That led Arizona to make the decision that Sofia needed to move back to New York and Arizona needed to go with her. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")''\n\n\nSofia was asked to be a flower girl at [[Jo and Alex's Wedding]] alongside her friend Zola. She came to the wedding with Arizona. When the wedding was delayed and then cancelled, Sofia asked Arizona if they'd miss their flight. Arizona assured her they wouldn't and were just staying to help April make sure everything got cleaned up. They then witnessed Matthew proposing to April and them getting married. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe has three parents: Callie, Arizona, and Mark. Her father died when she was still very young, leaving her to be raised by her mothers.\n\nWhen Callie was planning to move to New York with Penny, Arizona fought Callie for custody. Arizona won, but she ended up making a shared schedule with Callie, saying that Sofia deserved two happy moms.\n\nAfter some time living in New York, Sofia decided she wanted to move back to Seattle and so she came back to live with Arizona. When Sofia was in Seattle, she constantly missed New York, leading to Arizona's decision to move to New York so Sofia could have both her moms in the same place and not be constantly missing one of them.  \n\n\nShe and [[Zola Grey Shepherd]] are friends. When Zola was gone after Derek died, Sofia asked when she'd be coming back and insisted on getting her a Christmas present. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")'' They frequently had play dates together when they were little and have been seen playing together on multiple occassions and at family events such as birthdays and weddings.\n\nShe also has a friend named Kayla.

Jenny said she knew that she had ruined her mother's life, because her mother had spent her whole life telling her not to repeat her mistakes.\n\nDuring an exam, Jenny's pressure bottomed out.

In order to fix her heart, they had to deliver her baby at  weeks gestation. After he was born, Tommy was taken to the NICU. However, he suffered a spontaneous intestinal perforation and had to be taken right back into surgery. [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] operated to repair his intestines. The surgery was successful and he was taken from there to the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]], where his condition was stable. He also had a patent ductus arteriosis, which they treated with indomethacin. ''(\"[[Have You Seen Me Lately?]]\")''\n\n\nNot long after he was born, Tommy developed NEC and needed abdominal surgery. He was taken into surgery, where Arizona determined that only a small portion of his bowel was necrotic, so there was more than enough to salvage. While they were operating, Tommy went into cardiogenic shock.\n\nAfter surgery, Arizona informed his parents that he was in congestive heart failure. As she listed their treatment options, Chris shot each one down, stating the risks of each one. Arizona asked them how aggressive they wanted to be with their treatment. Morgan wanted to be more aggressive, but Chris wanted to stop.\n\nThey started treatment and Morgan was advised that it could be hard to watch, but since Chris had left, she decided to stay. She was upset when the treatment was started, but she stayed with him. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\nTommy later developed a small brain bleed, which they monitored. Teddy also told Morgan that Tommy had a pericardial tumor, which had to be removed that day as it was compressing his heart. Callie informed Morgan that Tommy's hip displasia could be treated with a harness.\n\nWhile he was in surgery for his heart, his brain bleed worsened to stage III, requiring surgery. The surgery was successful and he was left stable in the NICU. ''(\"[[One Step Too Far]]\")''\n\nLater, Tommy went into sepsis due to an ileocolic fistula. He had also developed post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and had retinopathy of prematurity. Arizona listed the things Tommy was at risk for and asked Morgan if she still wanted to proceed with the surgery or if she wanted to allow natural death. Morgan was convinced that they weren't there yet. Despite Arizona saying that things were deteriorating significantly and that Morgan needed to consider what kind of life she wanted for her son, Morgan decided to go ahead with the surgery. ''(\"[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks later, an x-ray revealed that Tommy's NEC had returned. Arizona was reluctant to operate, but Morgan insisted, so she took him into surgery, but once she was in there, she saw that almost all of his bowel was necrotic, so she closed. She explained the situation to Morgan, informing her that it was time to say goodbye. In the NICU, Alex disconnected all of Tommy's machines and allowed Morgan to hold him while he died. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")''\n\n\n\nWhen Thomas was born, he was very sick. As such, his father felt they shouldn't try to prolong his life as his chances of survival were so low. His father ultimately left him in the care of his mother, Morgan. Morgan continued to fight for Tommy until they reached a point where there was nothing more they could do and they disconnected all the machines and allowed Morgan to hold him while he died.\n\n\n*He was born at  weeks gestation.\n*He was named after his mother's father.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nThomasPeterson.png|[[Have You Seen Me Lately?]]\nThomasPeterson.png|[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\nThomasPeterson.png|[[One Step Too Far]]\nThomasPeterson.png|[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]\nThomasPeterson.png|[[Moment of Truth]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Thomas Peterson Appearances}}\n[[de:Tommy Peterson]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peterson, Thomas}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neonatal)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.
