While interviewing for Chief Resident with Owen, April went over the checklist she'd developed and said that Raul was headed for bronchoscopy to rule out cancer. His family overheard and was worried bout him having cancer. She assured them that that was a small chance. Cristina took over the case and took him into bronchoscopy, where she found out that he had a tree growing in his lung. She wanted to take him into surgery to remove it. However, because she'd broken protocol by doing the bronchoscopy without Teddy's authorization, the Arandas were offered another surgeon. However, they wanted to stick with Cristina, who had found the tree because he'd seen three doctors before for the cough and she finally gave him the right diagnosis.\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Annette Aranda]].\n\n\nHis son, Miguel, was worried about him.
