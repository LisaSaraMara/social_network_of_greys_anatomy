For many years, Addison and Archer believed that their father cheated on their mother with many women, but eventually they found out she was a lesbian and had been seeing [[Susan Grant]] for many years while married to \"The Captain,\" who was in love with her.\n\n\nHe showed up suddenly in Los Angeles to visit Addison, who didn't want to see him. They'd had a fight the last time they were together and she said she didn't want to see him anymore. Despite this, they went to lunch. Addison later went to his hotel room and said that he wasn't her family. Her family was the other doctors in the practice. ''(\"[[Sins of the Father]]\")''\n\nHe and Addison had lunch together several times, though each was awkward until they started talking about a case she was working on. Addison later admitted to Naomi that most of their relationship was him lecturing her and her pretending not to already know what he was telling her. After talking to Violet about improving their relationship, he went to her and asked if he could watch her perform the surgery they'd talked about. She said it was okay and after watching her operating, he said her work was elegant. She then offered to let him come to her house, something she'd previously not allowed. After learning that he'd slept with Violet, who said he was gentleman, she confronted him, wondering why he could be a gentleman to other women, but not to her or Bizzy. After she left, he called Bizzy and told her to come tell the truth or he would do it himself. ''(\"[[The Parent Trap]]\")''\n\nBizzy came as requested\uaand brought her assistant, [[Susan Grant]]. After seeing the tension between Susan and The Captain, Addison believed The Captain had slept with her, but later she\uawalked in on Susan kissing Bizzy. The Captain said he was okay with the relationship\uabecause it's what they had chosen. Sam approached\uaThe Captain and Bizzy and told them to leave because he saw what having them there\uawas doing to Addison. As they left, Addison went to the airport to see them off and talk to Bizzy. ''(\"[[Blowups]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Bizzy died, she was brought back to Connecticut to be buried. After her memorial service, The Captain confessed to Pete that he believed Bizzy would come back to him after Susan died and they'd live out the rest of their lives together. ''(\"[[Home Again]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Bizzy Forbes]]\nHe had two children with [[Bizzy Forbes|Bizzy Bradford Forbes]], but had many affairs. He was in love with her, but she was in love with [[Susan Grant]].\n\n[[Violet Turner]]\nHe slept with [[Violet Turner]] while visiting his daughter. She said they should do it more often and he said they could any time, but when he started to kiss her again, she became self-conscious about her scar, though he assured that it would fade and that it was a reminder that she survived and she deserved to do whatever she wanted for a while.

She is married to\ua[[Jake Reilly]]\uaand mother to [[Henry Montgomery]].\n\n\n\nAddison was born in [[Connecticut]] in  into a wealthy background with her brother [[Archer Montgomery|Archer]], father [[\"The Captain\" Montgomery|\"The Captain\"]]\uaand mother [[Bizzy Forbes|Bizzy]].\n\nWhen she was seven, she fell off her bike in the vineyard while going downhill because her tire came off. She flipped over the handlebars and scraped her face on the ground, but [[Archer Montgomery|Archer]] picked her up, told her it was going to be okay, and carried her the half a mile back home. This is how Addison has always seen her older brother, as the big brother who carried her home. \n\nFrom the age of eight, Addison was mixing her father, [[\"The Captain\" Montgomery|The Captain's]] drinks.\n\nWhen she was , Addison also had to deny her father's affair with his secretary, waiting for \"daddy\" while he was having sex in his office and then pretending she had fun getting ice-cream with her father. Her father also had affairs with (among others)  maids,  of Addison's nannies, Jolene her French tutor, and the chef. She only discovered in adulthood that it was her mother who had cheated first, with a woman but chose to stay married because she already had a family. The Captain knew but also stayed with her, but had affairs with other women.\n\nWhen she went to prom in high school, it was with Skippy Gold. Addison was a band geek with braces and a lisp, and she was forced to talk about ''[[Star Wars]]'' the whole night.\n\nAddison attended college at Yale University and medical school at [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] where she met her future husband,\ua[[Derek Shepherd]]; [[Sam Bennett]], a future boyfriend; [[Mark Sloan]], her future lover; and [[Naomi Bennett]], her best friend.\n\nAddison is entitled to a twenty-five million dollar trust fund and owns three properties: a\ua[[New York]]\uabrownstone, a house in\ua[[The Hamptons]], and a house at\ua[[Santa Monica]]. She now lives beside a beach in\ua[[Malibu]]\uanext door to an old friend,\ua[[Sam Bennett]].\n\n\nAddison cheated on her husband of over  years,\ua[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]\uawith his best friend\ua[[Mark Sloan]]. Before this, Addison and Derek's marriage had been an unhappy one, as Derek had been putting in little effort. Derek even mentioned that the demise of their marriage was not her fault alone. They each owned their respective practices, putting a strain on their marriage. When he found Mark and Addison in bed together, he simply walked away.\n\nDerek then picked up his life in New York, sold his private practice, and relocated to Seattle. This is where he began his relationship with\ua[[Meredith Grey]], who later became his wife.\n\n[[File:xAddisonIntroduction.png|thumb|Addison introduces herself to Meredith.]]\nUpon Richard's request to help out with a patient, Addison visited Seattle. When she arrived at the hospital, she saw Derek fixing Meredith's coat in the lobby. Derek turned around and was shocked to see her, his expression enough for Addison to put the pieces together. She walked over and he asked her what she was doing here. She said he'd know if he had bothered to return any of her calls. She then introduced herself to Meredith as Derek's wife, much to Meredith's surprise. She guessed that Meredith was the woman who had been screwing her husband.<ref>[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith ran off, leaving the married couple to talk. She mentioned that his hair looked different, comparing it to Russell Crowe's. He asked her again what she was doing there. She returned the question, pointing out he had abandoned his entire life in New York City. She also brought up his new Seattle girlfriend, who was young, sweet, and in awe of his being a neurosurgeon, whom she summarized as the 'anti-Addison.' He told her to forget about winning him back. She made it clear that was not her intention and stated she was there for a TTTS case on Richard's request. She assumed Richard would have told him. She leaned in and told Derek that she'd always had a thing for Russell Crowe before walking off with a satisfied expression. She went to see Richard, with whom she had a joyful reunion, until Derek interrupted to vent his frustration. Addison left him to it.\n[[File:-.jpg|thumb|Addison and Derek discuss her requesting Meredith for her case.]]\nThe next morning, Addison specifically requested Meredith for the TTTS case. Together, they went to see the patient. In the room, Addison bombarded Meredith with questions. Once outside, Meredith said she could have answered the question had Addison given her the time to do so. Addison commented she was tough on everyone, not just the women sleeping with her husband. She gave Meredith further instructions. Later, Meredith interrupted Addison and Derek talking about her surgical skills to brief Addison about abnormalities found on the ultrasound. Due to signs of heart failure in the babies, they had to operate sooner than planned. Meredith watched closely as Addison worked her magic in the OR. As they checked on Julie after the surgery, Julie requested Meredith be thrown off her case since she had overheard Addison's comment about Meredith sleeping with her husband. Addison then clarified that she had cheated on Derek so the wronged woman here was Meredith, whom she said deserved an apology from Julie.<ref>[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]], x</ref>\n\nAddison went to visit Richard in his room and found him in the company of Derek and Adele. Adele was delighted to see her and commented that she knew Addison and Derek would get back together, but Derek firmly said that adultery was enough to end their marriage. Later, Addison asked to talk to Meredith and inquired if Derek had told her why he had left her. Meredith said she had nothing to do with that situation. Addison was surprised and impressed to find out that Meredith had not taken Derek back. She added that there are two sides to every story and implied that her cheating on Derek with his best friend had been a desperate attempt to get his attention. At the end of the day, Addison ended up on an elevator with Derek. They shared what they had each told Meredith about their situation. Derek scoffed at the idea of Addison sleeping with Mark to get his attention. Addison replied that she was just scratching an itch by that point and Mark was just there, but it was preceded by years of them getting busy with their careers and lazy in their marriage. Derek made it clear he was not interested in Addison's explanation.<ref>[[Enough is Enough]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Addison moved into Derek's trailer, and the two attempted to reconcile. Addison asked Derek if they were even after she got poison oak from walking Meredith's dog in the woods. The two laughed over the incident. They divorced after Addison found a pair of women's underwear in Derek's pocket.\n\nAfter the divorce, Addison had to put Derek in a tiny box and make him petty and insignificant to get up in the morning.\n\n\nAddison had very little in Seattle after she and Derek divorced. Her marriage with Derek was over, her relationship with Mark had completely vanished, and her attempt at a relationship with [[Alex Karev]]\uafailed. She visited Los Angeles to see her friends [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]]\uaand\ua[[Sam Bennett]], also because Naomi was a fertility specialist.\uaNaomi offered her a position at\ua[[Oceanside Wellness Group]].\uaAddison returned to Los Angeles not long after that, taking Oceanside Wellness up on their job offer at their practice. One day, Addison searched through Naomi's files at the practice to read her file and found that her chances of becoming pregnant were worse than she'd previously imagined. She learned that her egg count was a mere two, and was heartbroken.\n\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|Addison returns to [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]]. ([[Piece of My Heart]])]] Later, Addison returned to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to treat a pregnant woman suffering from [[Piece_of_My_Heart#Medical_Notes|ectopia cordis]], in which the fetus's heart was growing outside of the body. Although she seemed somewhat happy to be back in Seattle, she made it clear that the visit wasn't permanent and she had every intention of returning to [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. Addison also showed that the history between her, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] was in the past as she was able to hug Meredith and be genuinely happy for them, unaware that they had broken up.\n\nDuring her stay, in which the surgeries on both mother and child were successful due to Addison, [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], and [[Erica Hahn|Erica's]] expertise, Addison was forced to realize that a lot had changed in her absence (particularly [[The Heart of the Matter|the breakdown of Callie and George's marriage]], [[A Change is Gonna Come|Meredith and Derek's break up]], and his [[Crash Into Me, Part |relationship with Rose]], as well as [[Lay Your Hands on Me|Bailey and Tucker's marital issues]].)\n\nWhen [[Richard Webber|the chief]] approached her and attempted to persuade her to stay at Seattle Grace, Addison told him that she now knew it was the right thing to leave and told him to fill her position. Before returning to Los Angeles, however, Addison went to [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's bar]] and warned [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] that, even though she was now zen, she wanted to \"kick her ass\" for not fighting for [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and allowing his new girlfriend to have the happily ever after that she deserved.<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb]] Addison's status in the dating world remained uncertain as she had been stood up by [[Kevin Nelson|Kevin]] after she went to find him at the station, and remained unaware that [[Pete Wilder|Pete]] had gone to her house the same night. Sometime later, Addison and [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]] found themselves at odds regarding Naomi allowing a couple to conceive a child through Naomi's fertility treatment who would act as an organ donor for their ill child. When the parents demanded Addison birth their child three months premature, an ethical debate raged between Addison and Naomi. Addison eventually learned Naomi agreed to help the couple due to the practice's financial trouble that she was concealing from the group. Despite Naomi's pleas, Addison told [[Sam Bennett|Sam]] that the practice was in trouble. At the same time, [[Kevin Nelson|Kevin]] returned for Addison to tell her that he stood her up to train for the SWAT team and the two flirted, leaving their future ambiguous.<ref>[[A Family Thing]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nArmed with the knowledge of the practice's struggles, Sam and Addison formed a hostile takeover of the leadership of the practice and each doctor worked to save the practice from extinction. Addison and Naomi's friendship, however, couldn't stand what Naomi saw to be a betrayal and Naomi cut her best friend out of her personal life, leaving only professional ties.<ref>[[Equal and Opposite]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nWith her 'family' at the practice in disarray, Addison took [[Charlotte King|Charlotte's]] offer to do some surgeries for [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose]], for her to relieve her frustrations which she claimed 'fall away' when she holds a scalpel. However, rushed off her feet and desperate to do nothing but cut Addison spent no time conversing with her patients and getting to know them. When a stressed and worried husband of a pregnant patient asked her what his wife's name was, and she was unable to answer, she realized that she had become the one who wasn't talking and decided to return to family at the practice for good, refuting Charlotte's offer to work at St. Ambrose full-time. This persuaded her to move forward with [[Kevin Nelson|Kevin]] as well as attempting to repair her friendship with Naomi.<ref>[[Nothing to Talk About]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] tells Addison and [[Archer Montgomery|Archer]] that the cysts are inoperable.]] Having landed in Seattle, a worried Addison was greeted by [[Richard Webber|Richard]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] as Archer was prepared for a diagnosis. Derek discovered eight cysts caused by the parasites and, having consulted specialists, revealed that they were inoperable as surgery would cause more harm than good. A reluctant Addison refused to give up on Archer and told Derek that she needed him to be a God. As she attempted to pray in the hospital chapel, Addison confessed to [[Callie Torres|Callie]] that she didn't believe God knew who she was, and so praying for a miracle was worthless. Her old friend then reminded her that she saves babies, and God knows who she is because of it. Having received the push from [[Sam Bennett|Sam]], Derek decided to do the surgery. Addison watched on tenterhooks as Derek attempted to remove the parasitic cysts. When removing the eighth and final one, it ruptured, allowing the parasite to dig further into his brain. Addison, however, faced much relief when the parasite was caught, extracted and Archer stabilized. To celebrate Derek's success the old friends visited the [[Emerald City Bar]], where they reminisced about [[Derek's Song|Derek's love song to Addison]]. Addison however, recognized that Derek was in her past, and, despite her gratitude, she had to once again make him petty and insignificant to move on with her life.<ref>[[Before and After]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Violet was attacked and gave\ua[[Lucas Wilder|her baby]]\uato\ua[[Pete Wilder|Pete]], Addison became one of the principal caregivers to Lucas. She filled the void left by his birth mother and was overjoyed at the prospect of having a baby of her own. However, after Violet recuperated, Addison told Pete to go back to her, and subsequently lost touch with Lucas. She was, once again, left without a child of her own.\n\n\nAs\ua[[Mark Sloan|Mark]]\uawanted the best care possible for his daughter\ua[[Sloan Riley|Sloan]]\uaand was unsure of\ua[[Elizabeth Chen|Elizabeth Chen's]]\uaabilities, he had Addison fly in for the surgery. When Addison was operating, she realized it would be riskier than she thought. She was confident she could continue successfully, but Mark insisted that she stop. However, he later traveled with Sloan to Los Angeles so Addison could perform it. She did so successfully.\n\n\nSince Callie and Addison were close friends, Addison flew back to Seattle, at\ua[[Richard Webber|Richard's]]\uarequest after hearing that Callie had been in a car accident. She later performed an emergency C-section on Callie and delivered her daughter,\ua[[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]], prematurely.<ref>[[Song Beneath the Song]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Naomi left, Addison went to therapy.\n\nThe night Pete had a heart attack, Addison sat with Lucas and kept him comfortable until Violet was contacted and returned from the airport. She assured him everything was going to be okay, as Sam and Amelia were the best people to take care of him. Despite Sam still not having changes his mind about having a baby, Addison decided to go ahead anyway and made an appointment with the best fertility specialist she could find in the city. That man turned out to be\ua[[Jake Reilly]], her anonymous date she met flirting over pineapples. She then wanted to quit, but Jake had no problem leaving their flirtation in the past. He promised her he'd give her a baby.<ref>[[God Laughs]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nNot long after, Jake turned out to be applying for Naomi's job at the practice. Addison, being in charge, was hesitant to hire him. Meanwhile, she informed Sam she was going off birth control, so she had him buy condoms. After Jake assured her he had no ulterior motive and promised not to flirt, Addison had to face that he was the best candidate and officially hired him. Addison told her therapist that she didn't need to tell Sam about her Fiji history with Jake, as they were broken up at the time, and admitted that she finally happy again.<ref>[[Breaking the Rules]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAddison started looking for IVF specialists to start the process. Needing someone to talk to, she grew closer to Violet, who also needed someone to talk to about her marriage problems. Sam later realized he needed to be there for his girlfriend and offered to listen to her talk about IVF specialists, but she told him she was fine. In therapy, she said she became a better and more generous person because of Sam.<ref>[[Deal With It]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nHowever, Addison soon realized she must be crazy to compartmentalize Sam and the baby, starting to fear Sam was going to leave her. She took her concerns to Jake after he told her some more about himself and his youth to make her trust him, but all Jake could tell her was to listen to her instincts. At night, she told Sam what she was worried about. He knew she was, but kissed her to tell her he wouldn't leave. However, in therapy, Addison still said she came to realize that maybe love means wanting the other person to be happy, even if they can't be with you.<ref>[[Remember Me]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAddison started the IVF process with fertility drugs and asked Jake to inject them as she wanted to stay sexy for Sam, so he couldn't do it for her. Addison tried to keep it secret in order not to become the office gossip, but that became difficult when she soon started suffering from mood swings and extreme emotional reactions to what was happening at the practice. Addison started thinking Sam was just dating her because she couldn't have children, but Jake assured her that was just the hormones. He did tell her she needed people on her side, as she couldn't go through it alone. She then told Sam that she started the IVF process with Jake's help. He once again stated he didn't want a new child because the experience of having a child is as awful at times as it is wonderful, so he was glad to have gotten through it with Maya. He assured Addison that didn't mean he stopped loving her, though. In therapy, Addison said she had to teach herself to have hope again.<ref>[[Step One]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nSoon after, Addison started looking for sperm donors, throwing out lots of candidates based on medical history alone. When she felt like she was drowning in files, Sam assured her she could make it happen. Addison asked her colleagues for help, but they all give her different advice. Addison received good news from Jake: they were able to retrieve  eggs, which needed to be picked that day. He'd contact a friend at the sperm bank to speed up the process, meaning they could fertilize the eggs that day. Sam came to support Addison when Jake would pick the eggs, but she was already under. She woke up with Sam by her side and started crying because she put herself in this position where a stranger was needed to get pregnant, all because she cheated. Sam convinced her the bad things didn't outweigh her good qualities, so she shouldn't punish herself. He advised her to pick the musician's sperm. She did pick him, and later that day, Jake fertilized the eggs with Addison watching.<ref>[[If I Hadn't Forgotten...]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nOver the three days the embryo had to grow in the lab, Addison kept checking on it. She wasn't allowed to have sex before the implantation, but Sam suggested they do \"other things\". She happily agreed to that. Meanwhile, Addison also met [[Ryan Kerrigan]]\uaand expressed her worries over Amelia, who assured Addison she was fine.\uaThe day after, Jake implanted the eggs. In therapy, Addison said she was thrilled and terrified that if all things went right, there could be an entire person with a full life ahead could be growing inside her. She was looking forward to sharing experiences with her child.<ref>[[Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAmelia went missing for  days, and when she showed up at the practice to announce her engagement to Ryan, Addison was both angry and relieved at the same time. Since Charlotte was convinced Amelia was using, they staged an intervention at the practice. Amelia started attacking them one by one and hit Addison's weak spot when she attacked her about her infertility and past abortion. Addison threatened to report Amelia to the medical board, throw her out of her house and change the locks, and call in her family, but the only thing that actually got Amelia to stay and listen was the oxy she demanded. The doctors gave her the oxy, which Amelia snorted off the reception desk. Right when Amelia seemed to cave to her friends' talks and agreed to go to rehab, Ryan arrived. The doctors suggested they also help Ryan, but a quarrel ensued when Addison noticed Ryan was wearing\ua[[Mr. Shepherd|Amelia's father's]]\uawatch. Amelia aggressively forbade her from telling that story and soon left with Ryan, leaving Addison to feel like the intervention was a bad idea. However, the next morning, Addison received a call about Amelia, who was ready to go rehab.<ref>[[Who We Are]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAddison helped her pack and drove her to the treatment center. Amelia, who has a great mother, had Addison think that even the best mothers' kids can go down the wrong path. Later that day, Addison received the news that she was not pregnant, but Jake assured her that didn't mean it was over. Sam seemed relieved about the news, so Violet agreed to hold her hand the next time she was going to try. Addison came up with a crazy plan that included a lot of fertility drugs. She wanted to try again with fresh sperm and fresh eggs, even though she had two frozen eggs left herself. Addison took Sam to therapy with her as he needed to face there would be a baby in her life soon, but he said that was not a problem yet and that he wanted Addison. Two weeks later, Addison collapsed at the practice as a side-effect to the hormone treatment. That made her decide that the embryo transfer would be it: she'd either be pregnant or not. After she was fully recovered, they did the transfer. On Thanksgiving, Addison did a pregnancy test.<ref>[[The Breaking Point]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nIn\ua[[If/Then|Meredith's dream]], Derek and Addison are still in an unhappy marriage and Addison is pregnant with their child, though the child is later revealed to be [[Mark Sloan|Mark's]]. Also, Addison is still part of the surgical staff at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and remains the [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] and [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal]] [[Attending#Department Head|head]].\n\n\nMere hours after delivering a baby at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]], Addison got a call from her social worker saying that a birth mom had chosen her. She returned to the hospital, shocked to find that it was [[Judi]], the same woman whose baby she had delivered. Judi had decided she couldn't find a better mom for the baby, and that it must have been fate since Addison was the one who delivered the baby boy. Addison named him [[Henry Montgomery]].\n\n\nAddison lost her way during the pandemic. Two months into the first lockdown, Jake and Henry were bickering about Game of Thrones and Addison couldn't bare it anymore, seriously considering to leave Jake. She got up off the couch, got in her car, and started driving for two hours before she stopped and asked herself what she was doing. Addison started to over-indulged in wine. Henry became obsessed with video games and Jake took up a model train hobby, which truly delighted him much to Addison's surprise. She grew increasingly uneasy spending so much time at home and at one point even considered checking herself into rehab for her drinking habits. She went even darker and started daydreaming about going to sleep and never waking up, which comforted her. Eventually, she came up with a research project on uterine transplants and met [[Tovah Freedman]]. The drive to help Tovah motivated Addison to pull herself back together and get out of bed every morning.\n\nAs part of her research, Addison eventually travelled to Seattle to perform a uterine transplant on Tovah, who had her support system in Seattle. Addison reached out to Richard if there was an OR available for her and agreed to make her return a grand rounds teaching opportunity for the residents, whom he mentioned were behind. On the day of the surgery, Seattle was going through a heatwave.\n\nAddison arrived at the skills lab to introduce herself to the group of residents. En route to the patient, she explained her research and quizzed Levi on the pelvic anatomy. When he answered correctly, she allowed him to present the case and upon seeing a connection between him and the Jewish patient, she chose him to scrub in with her along with Richard. The other residents gathered in the gallery to observe and Addison kept them engaged with a multitude of questions. In the middle of the procedure, the HVAC system broke down. The temperature in the OR quickly rose yet Addison refused to close up the patient despite Richard's warning about the risk of infection. To work faster, Addison requested Meredith due to her experience with microvascular anastomosis of the abdomen. Meredith soon joined her in the OR and they congratulated one another on their professional accomplishments. As they operated, Addison asked Meredith what big thing was next for her. Meredith revealed that she had some idea but she needed to sort out things logistically and have a difficult conversation with Richard. After evacuating a clot, Meredith and Addison successfully finished the procedure. As they left the OR, they heard the residents gossiping about the tension between them.\n[[File:xMeredithComfortsAddison.png|thumb|Meredith comforts Addison after opening up to one another.]]\nHowever, once alone on the elevator with Meredith, Addison broke down crying because coming here made Derek's death all too real for her. Meredith said he was there and in her kids is well, whom she invited Addison to meet over dinner at her house. Addison then told Meredith to fight for this big project if she believed in it, stating Meredith had never been one to shy away to fight for what she loved.\n\nAfterward, Addison went to check on Tovah in the ICU. Everything was well. Richard congratulated her and Addison told him the residents were not as bad as he had made them out to be. He couldn't help but point out the difference between the current generation and Addison and Derek's generation, stating the current residents complained a lot. Addison pointed out they were simply standing up for themselves and refusing to be worked to death in a system that could be considered inhumane. She considered that progress and stated there was always room for improvement in the medical education system. He agreed and told her he was glad to see her again. Addison then finally met up with Amelia in the lobby. After a long hug, Addison told her about Meredith's invitation. Amelia took her home and introduced her to Zola and Bailey. Addison got emotional upon meeting them and sat down with them to have ice cream for dinner.<ref>[[Hotter Than Hell]], x</ref>\n\nThe day after, en route to the airport, Addison was notified that Tovah had had a seizure in the ICU. Addison rushed back to the hospital and enlisted Amelia's help to figure out what was causing the seizures. Addison was panicking because Tovah's sister had begged her not to participate in the trial and it could mean that they would have to remove the uterus, meaning all had been for nothing. As they awaited the MRI scan, Amelia confided in Addison as to why she had left Scout's father. Upon hearing that Amelia had struggled so hard during the pandemic, Addison relayed her own experiences, which comforted Amelia. Eventually, they found that the seizure had been due to neurotoxicity from the anti-rejection medication. They decided to switch the meds and start anticonvulsants. Addison needed Amelia to tell her that Tovah would be okay as she absolutely prioritized Tovah's life over her study. Amelia pointed out that Tovah had loved her husband so much that she entered Addison's trial, very much aware of the risks it entailed. Tovah recovered in the ICU and Addison happily informed her that there was still a chance for her to have her husband's baby. On her way out, Addison recalled her frustration with Jake and posed that a slight mental health crisis doesn't make for good decision making. Amelia stated she stayed with Link through the pandemic because she deemed herself crazy to leave a good guy but she wasn't feeling crazy now nor did she feel the need to get high; she realized she just didn't want a ring or more babies, so she thought it the kindest and sanest thing to let him go. Addison smiled and commented that Amelia was all grown up now.<ref>[[With a Little Help From My Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\nAddison is a very confident, smart, and poised woman. She can be described as cold and unforgiving, however, she is also quite warm and kind. She is also very concentrated and dedicated to her work, as she is considered the best in her field. Addison is sometimes difficult and uncompromising but she can be very kind and accepting.\n\nAddison describes herself as a worrier; she constantly worries about what's happening and what's not happening. Professionally, she is very confident, but not personally. She likes to think that worrying prepares her for whatever may happen.\n\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Derek and Addison attempting to give their relationship another try.]]\n\nAddison met her future husband, [[Derek Shepherd]], in [[Medical School|medical school]] in the summer. Their relationship grew and they eventually married. Derek once wrote [[Derek's Song|a song]] for her.\n\nAfter medical school, Addison and Derek became extremely successful in their respective fields and each began their own practice in [[New York]]. However, this strained their marriage.\n\nAddison was married to Derek Shepherd for eleven years before eventually sleeping with Derek's best friend, [[Mark Sloan]], which prompted Derek to leave [[New York]] for [[Seattle]] at the request of their old friend and mentor, [[Richard Webber]].\n\nAfter she and Derek initially separated, she tried to get over him, even hoping that dying her hair blond would help. She remained in New York and lived with Mark for two months, during which she became pregnant with Mark's child but she chose to have an abortion. The relationship ended when Mark cheated on Addison and [[Richard Webber]] brought her to Seattle Grace for a consult on a difficult case.\n\nAfter a period of antagonism between her and Derek (in which he continually referred to her as \"Satan\"), Addison decided to stay on as the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Neonatal Surgery and OB/GYN at Seattle Grace, signing a two-year contract after she and Derek decided to make an effort to work things out. Addison was unaware that Derek still had feelings for [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]].\n\nWhen Addison discovered that her husband slept with Meredith at the hospital-sponsored prom, Addison (in a drunken haze) called Mark Sloan to Seattle. She and Derek agreed that their marriage was over and started divorce proceedings. She asked Mark to go back to New York, but he stayed, expressing his desire to continue their relationship.\n\nWhen the divorce was finalized, Addison dropped the \"Shepherd\" from her last name. Wanting to make a fresh start, Derek happily relinquished most of their shared properties (their [[Brownstone]] in [[Manhattan]] and a residence in [[The Hamptons]]) to her believing that she deserved it as his initial impression was that she had only had a one-night stand with Mark while he carried on an affair with Meredith.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShe stayed in Seattle for a long while after and a possibility of a relationship between her and [[Alex Karev]] was hinted at when they kissed in [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's bar]]. She felt it was too strange though and he said he didn't care so the relationship was not brought ahead any further.\n\nDuring the  days that Mark and Addison were trying to remain celibate to give themselves a chance, she slept with Alex. However, despite Addison wanting more, he wasn't ready for that.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Addison sleeps with Mark]] Addison and Mark originally met in med school. She cheated on her husband, Derek, with him. After Derek left for Seattle, Addison and Mark lived together for two months, during which time she became pregnant. She had an abortion, and Mark eventually cheated on her.\n\nAfter finding out Meredith and Derek slept together at the prom, she called Mark over to Seattle and slept with him again. Mark decided to move to Seattle in hopes of pursuing a relationship with Addison.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the day she discovered she was pregnant, Addison and Mark made a deal. If they both could abstain from sex for  days she would be willing to try a real relationship with him. She doesn't hold up her end of the bargain when she engaged in a sexual encounter with Alex at the hospital. Mark learned of this after witnessing them stumbling out of an on-call room. She was spared from confessing, however, when Mark selflessly lied to her by telling her he had broken their promise long before. He felt that although he had feelings for her, she shouldn't have to feel guilty.\n\nMark visited Addison in LA when his daughter, Sloan Riley, needed surgery. They had sex several times, which prompted Addison to ask Mark if he truly wanted to have a relationship with her because she could make it work. However, Mark was still in love with Lexie, so he apologized to Addison and turned her down.\n\n[[Pete Wilder]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Addison and Pete kiss.]] When she left [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] for a [[Oceanside Wellness Group|private practice]] in L.A, she had a brief interest in her co-worker [[Pete Wilder|Pete]] (whom she kissed) but gave up on any potential romance between the two after Pete stood her up for a date.\n\nLater, Pete and Addison reconnected at a hospital event and went back to her house to have pizza and watch lame TV shows, and ended up having sex. They started a relationship that they described as \"helping each other\" and Addison decided to move on from [[Sam Bennett|Sam]] since he was seemingly happy with his new girlfriend, making them officially a couple.\n\nWhen Pete was sick and Addison was looking after Lucas, Pete said \"I love you, [[Violet Turner|Violet]]\" to Addison while on fever medication, leading Addison to confront Pete six weeks later. Pete states that he will always love Violet as she is the mother of his child, but he wants to be with Addison.\ua\n\nViolet returns from Costa Rica and Addison tells her that Pete will pick her because she is Lucas' mother.\ua\n\nLater on the porch, Sam tells Addison he is sick of doing the right thing and should do the wrong thing, and then kisses her as Pete walks in.\ua\n\n[[Kevin Nelson]]\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb|Kevin and Addison sharing lunch in between surgeries.|xpx]] Addison was then asked out by [[Kevin Nelson]], a police officer. Unfortunately, her trust issues interfered with her and Kevin, issues that resulted in her jealously following Kevin after she thought he was having an affair and ending with her arrest by the SWAT team. Nonetheless, she confessed her issues to Kevin and they resumed their relationship.\n\nBut more troubles came when [[Archer Montgomery|Addison's brother]] came to visit and told Kevin that she was just \"enjoying him\". When he hadn't called Addison back; she had thought he was avoiding her, but would find out he had been shot. When her brother left; Kevin moved in with her while he was recovering. While Addison now had to deal with Charlotte who was opening up a competing practice on the fourth floor, she was more annoyed by [[Wyatt Lockhart|Dr. Wyatt Lockhart]], a doctor working for Charlotte's practice who steals a patient of Addison's and convinces Naomi to work for her. In the midst of this relationship, Addison and Kevin's different lifestyles get in the way of their relationship leading to him moving out. But Addison later calls him telling him she misses him, and they make up.\n\nHowever, Addison kisses Wyatt after seeing him for who he really is, not the arrogant, headline grabber she thought he was. Kevin repeatedly questions her where she was that night and believes she's lying, Addison claims she was working, and just as Kevin was finally able to drop the questioning, she admits she kissed another man, and they break up. As Addison goes to Wyatt to try a new relationship, she catches Naomi having sex with Archer instead.\n\n[[Noah Barnes]]\nNoah and Addison frequently met in the scrub room over three months, one of them always finishing surgery and scrubbing out and one scrubbing in, leading to their greeting of \"Finishing or starting?\". They both continued to flirt, not knowing each other's names, and eventually meet in the doctor's lounge where Noah asks for her name. Looking shocked, he quickly leaves.\n\nAddison later meets him as the husband of one of her pregnant patients, Morgan Gellman. Upon this discovery, Addison quickly removed herself from Morgan's case, as she was not comfortable with her feelings for Noah while she treated his wife, feelings which Noah reciprocates. Addison decides not to make a move in their relationship, refusing to be a homewrecker, after her past mistakes with her ex-husband and his best friend. Noah, however, asks her not to leave the case, as she is the best in her field and Morgan cannot lose another child (she had a string of miscarriages before seeing Addison), and he will keep his feelings for Addison in check. However, Noah cannot help the way he feels, and Morgan realizes her marriage is in jeopardy, asking Addison to save her child, as that is all that is keeping her and Noah together. She says she sees it in Noah's eyes, he's there, but he's not quite there. When Addison has to perform surgery on Morgan, Noah is not there for her and Morgan is willing to put off the surgery to have Addison find Noah and he eventually does go into the OR to be there for Morgan, with a push from Addison.\n\n[[Sam Bennett]]\nSam asked Addison out when they were in med school, but Addison declined because [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]] was in love with him. When Addison moved to LA, she bought the house next door to Sam, leading to their developing friendship.\ua\n\nAddison and Sam kissed after a hiking experience gone wrong while discussing what would have happened had Addison said yes to Sam in med school. They kissed twice more and Sam propositioned Addison to develop their relationship, but Addison said no because Naomi was her best friend.\n\nSam dated another [[Pediatrics|Neonatal]] surgeon, leading Addison to date [[Pete Wilder|Pete]], although she still loved Sam, and she is seen constantly talking about him to Pete. Sam and Addison had an off and on relationship for a long time. \ua\n\nThe main reason for their relationship troubles was that Addison wanted a child, but Sam had Maya, and Maya's daughter, and didn't want more kids. After Addison adopted Henry, Sam seemingly accepted Henry. He even asked her to marry him after Addison and Jake had had sex.\ua\n\n[[Jake Reilly]]\nWhen Addison's therapist told her to make a change in her life, she met Jake and they flirted over pineapples at the grocery store. They started seeing each other at a coffee shop. However, they both agreed to keep their identities in secret. Jake was going on vacation to Fiji and he asked Addison to come with him. She eventually accepted, but when at the airport, she realized it wasn't right to try to avoid Sam and the problems the practice was suffering.\n\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb|left|Addison and Jake at their wedding.]] Later on, Addison started her fertility treatment only to find out her doctor was Jake. He admitted he never left for Fiji. Addison, humiliated, left the office.\n\nWhen Jake interviewed for the fertility specialist opening at Oceanside Wellness, Addison was horrified because she recognized him as her former doctor. She was strongly opposed to the practice hiring him, but she ran out of excuses not to, as he was the perfect candidate for the job. Jake began working at the practice, and Addison made him not mention their previous encounters to Sam, who she was dating at the time of Jake's arrival.\n\nAddison began fertility treatments with Jake as her doctor. He helped her through her two failed IVFs and also to try to find a surrogate.\n\nShe once threw herself at him at an OB/GYN convention in Palm Springs. She was extremely drunk and stumbled into his hotel room, where she asked him if he wanted to sleep with her. He turned her down, saying that it was the alcohol talking and that she would regret it in the morning. When Addison woke the following morning, she remembered what had happened and was thoroughly embarrassed.\n\nJake once asked her if their relationship was purely physical because he cared about her, but she was sending him mixed signals. Addison confirmed that it was not just physical, but also emotional. Their relationship grew over time. When Jake was talking to his daughter, Angela, he told her that it wasn't Addison sending the mixed signals; it was him.\n\nAddison proposed to Jake shortly before Henry's adoption, and was thoroughly humiliated when he didn't answer; but after a talk with the ghost of his late wife, he accepted. They later got married.\n\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Addison and Callie.]] Since arriving at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], Addison has made many friendships with other hospital staff, most notably [[Callie Torres]] and [[Miranda Bailey]] (Miranda's reasons being that Addison smells nice, she's polite, and she saves babies). Her friendship with the two ladies has often been based on the fact that they act as each other's confidantes. Callie and Addison often discuss their current relationships and love lives, which has ultimately led to a very close friendship between the two. Addison is also very good friends with fellow attending, [[Preston Burke]], and her ex-husband, [[Derek Shepherd]]. She had a good friendship with [[Mark Sloan]] and a father-daughter bond with [[Richard Webber]] as she is often portrayed to be very close to him. The only intern that Addison really bonded with was [[Alex Karev]] but she had no grudges against any of the interns and even hugged [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] as a sign of acceptance of her relationship with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]. She helped inspire [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] to become a fighter again.\n\nAddison is believed to have had a good relationship with the Shepherd family, in particular, [[Nancy Shepherd]], but, pending Derek's revelation of the true extent of Addison/Mark's relationship, her closeness to the Shepherds is in doubt.\n\n[[Image:TheGang.jpg|thumb|left|px|Addison, Derek, Mark, Sam and Naomi at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]].]]\n\nAfter moving to [[Los Angeles|L.A.]], Addison returned to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to help with a patient whose fetus\us heart was growing out of its body. Upon her return, Addison didn't expect much change; but soon learned that since her departure a lot had changed - for example, the break up of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and his relationship with [[Rose]], Callie's divorce and the breakdown of Bailey's marriage. During her stay there she met [[Callie Torres|Callie's]] new friend [[Erica Hahn]] and mistakenly interpreted their friendship as a relationship. The mother and child both survived the surgery and Addison prepared to leave Seattle and return to L.A, telling [[Richard Webber|Richard]] that she needed to come back to see how much she liked her new life. She left, but not before finding Meredith and telling her that she wasn't allowed to let Derek get away.\n\nAddison betrayed Naomi by confronting Sam with something about the practice. Naomi dropped her friendship with Addison and refused to talk to her. Eventually, she and Naomi began to mend their friendship and at last came back to being best friends. Addison (despite her rocky start) got on well with her new colleagues and friendships were rekindled (as she was friends with Naomi and Sam years ago), friendships were started (Violet, Dell, and Coop) and even a short time relationship occurred (with her now friend, Pete). When Naomi left for New York, Addison and Violet became very close, discussing relationship woes and Lucas situations, and just generally they were pretty close. When Amelia came to L.A., she and Addison had a very sisterly relationship.\n\n\nAddison is considered one of the best surgeons in her field in the world, having patients travel across the country to receive medical and surgical care from her, helped by her excellent bedside manner. She formerly worked at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], before her relocation to [[Los Angeles]] to join a private practice. When she relocated, her surgical practice became limited, with her practice being mostly obstetric work and occasional genetic counseling with Naomi. However, she does have surgical privileges at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]], allowing her to conduct her own surgeries, which is a right she exercises frequently. [[Charlotte King]] also calls on Addison to consult and take on complex medical cases from the hospital, which increases her OR time.\n\nShe completed her [[Resident|surgical residency]] under the supervision of her now good friend, [[Richard Webber]]. During her residency, Richard gave Addison a patient who would not survive, to teach Addison to not get too emotionally involved with her patients, as a result, Addison avoided Richard for almost a year. As an attending, she repeated the same trick with [[Izzie Stevens]] and one of the quintuplets the hospital was taking care of.\n\nDuring her [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN residency]], Addison was mentored by [[Vivian Carlsmith|Dr. Vivian Carlsmith]], a world-renowned OB/GYN , and pioneer in [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|maternal-fetal medicine]]. Addison was Vivian's smartest student, eventually surpassing Vivian's skill.\n\nAddison's training also encompasses why she is regarded as one of the best surgeons in her field: she is [[Board Certification|board certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology|obstetrics and gynecology with her sub-specialty in maternal-fetal medicine]], board-certified in [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]], and has completed a [[Fellow|fellowship]] in [[Medical Genetics|medical genetics]], specializing in cystic fibrosis. She is very open about her credentials and has relayed them to patients, co-workers, and subordinates that have doubted her abilities.\n\nSurgically, she is highly skilled in complex, often laparoscopic and open, obstetrical, gynecological, neonatal and [[Fetal Surgery|fetal]] surgeries. She is one of the few surgeons in the world who can separate fetal blood vessels and correct Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which she has special expertise in. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Addison treats a patient at Seattle Grace Hospital.]] She was formerly the [[Attending#Department Head|attending surgeon]] in charge of a world-class [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]] and state-of-the-art OB/GYN wing at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Although a highly successful and well-paid job, Addison left Seattle to go to L.A to join a private practice.\n\nWhen she arrived at the practice she was surprised to discover that Naomi, who gave her the job offer, didn't tell the rest of the staff about Addison. The other doctors showed Addison that she was clearly not welcome. On her first day in the practice, she performed surgery in an unsterilized delivery room only with the help of Alternative Medicine Specialist, Pete. On the end of the same day, they decided to vote on whether Addison should join the practice or not but Addison put her foot down and told them that she was going to stay even if they wanted her gone. Everyone was impressed by her speech and they decided not to vote after all.\n\n[[Image:PPSCast.jpg|thumb|right|px|The main staff of the Oceanside Wellness Group, and [[Charlotte King]], Chief of Staff at [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose]].]]\n\nWhen [[Richard Webber]] asked Addison to [[Piece of My Heart|return for a complex surgery]], she agreed, and at the end of the day, Richard attempts to get her back and letting her start the next morning. Addison declined the offer, being sure that leaving was the right thing to do. Similarly, when Naomi would not speak to Addison, Addison took several surgeries at [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose]] to relieve her frustrations. [[Charlotte King|Charlotte]] tried to woo her to the hospital with the surgeries but Addison declared the practice as her 'home'.\n\nNot long after moving to Los Angeles, Addison learned that [[Oceanside Wellness Group|the practice]] was failing financially so confronted Sam and the two formed a hostile takeover. In a bid to get the practice back to how it used to be Addison accidentally prompted a vote between [[Sam Bennett|Sam]] and [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]], but was stunned when she was elected to lead the practice as Addison's leadership shone through.\n\nLater, Addison dissolved the practice, funded the change, and renamed it to [[Seaside Health and Wellness]].\n\n\n*She was  when she moved to [[Los Angeles]].<ref>[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]], x</ref>\n*When Derek left her in New York, Addison dyed her hair blonde.<ref>[[Walk on Water]], x</ref>\n*Since moving to L.A, Addison describes herself as very zen. She buys aromatherapy candles and takes walks on beaches.\n*When she worked at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], her salary made her one of the highest-paid surgeons in the Northwestern United States.\n*Addison performs abortions. She believes life only begins when the baby can survive outside the mother's body, thus at birth.<ref>[[Crime and Punishment]], x (PP)</ref>\n*During her education, Addison always hated neuroanatomy.\n*Addison's SGH ID badge stated her departments were [[Obstetrics and Gynecology]] and [[Neonatology]].\n*Addison sometimes wears reading glasses.<ref>[[Staring at the Sun]], x</ref>\n*She has a lucky [[Scrubs|scrub cap]].\n*Addison has a very close sisterly relationship with [[Amelia Shepherd]], as Addison took her to get her ears pierced, she did her hair for prom, and she explained to her how to use birth control when Amelia didn't know who to ask.\n*Before she was officially a part of the [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] attending staff, she wore salmon scrubs. Whether or not she owned these scrubs or if she was wearing the uniform color of OB/GYNs remains unclear. Kate Walsh stated in an interview that it was decided to let Addison wear the navy blue scrubs to make her more part of the attendings group.\n*Whenever Addison wants to tell something that she cannot tell, she stares at the person she wants to tell.\n*Addison and her family are WASPs - they only go to Church on Christmas, and she does not know how to pray.<ref>[[Before and After]], x</ref>\n*Addison rarely mentions being a WASP during her time as a series regular on Grey's Anatomy but talks about it quite often in Private Practice. However, when she mentions it in GA, she is referring to the Protestant aspect, whereas she mainly uses the term in PP to discuss the culture of her childhood and family, in the social group aspect.\n*It has been noted that Addison's qualifications are unrealistic for a practicing doctor in her late-s/early-s, as she has already gained a highly-regarded reputation at her character's introduction to the series. Since Derek and she attended medical school together and were both educated by Richard Webber, it is likely she completed a -year residency in general surgery followed by a -year fellowship in pediatric surgery focusing on neonatal and fetal surgical procedures, returning to complete a -year residency in obstetrics and gynecology followed by a -year fellowship in maternal-fetal medicine, with her (likely to be) -year fellowship in medical genetics following everything else. In reality, under the best circumstances, this would make Addison a minimum of  years old.\n**It has been indicated throughout seasons five and six of ''[[Private Practice]]'' that Addison first completed a residency in [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]]. This would mean that she followed up with fellowships in maternal-fetal medicine and medical genetics, then completed a general surgery residency and finished with a pediatric surgery fellowship focusing on neonatal and fetal surgeries. If this is indeed the case, this creates a continuity-error with her being mentored by Richard, as stated in ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', as OB/GYN residents do not rotate in other surgical departments; this would be plausible if Richard were somehow involved in Addison's OB/GYN residency.\n*Addison appeared in every single episode of\ua''[[Private Practice]]'', except for\ua[[Two Steps Back]]\uaand\ua[[The Hardest Part]].\n*Although incorrect, [[Jake Reilly|Dr. Jake Reilly]] referred to Addison as a [[Neonatology|neonatologist]].<ref>[[Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Addison is the first and last character to be seen on ''Private Practice''. The first scene of the show is her talking to Richard about her resignation, and the last scene of the show is the group talking in the kitchen in the practice, with her face being the last one to be seen from inside the elevator before its doors close completely.\n*In one college semester, she took classes in organic chemistry, physics II, multivariable calculus, conversational French, introduction to the modern European novel, and tennis. She later had to retake tennis due to getting an incomplete.\n*She's one of only eight people in the world who can perform [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]], [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|perinatology]], and [[Neonatal Surgery|neonatal surgery]] on a world-class level.\n*She loves bacon cheeseburgers.\n*She has a cat named [[Milo (Cat)|Milo]], formerly owned by her patient [[Lillie Jordan]].\n*She wore a sea turtle scrub cap for her first solo surgery.\n*She used to have a pet hermit crab, but the air filter was noisy so she shut it off, and it died.<ref>[[Slip Slidin' Away]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Her fortune is about  million dollars.\n*She has a thing for Russell Crowe.<ref>[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]], x</ref>\n*She is not a fan of bread.<ref>[[With a Little Help From My Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nAddisonMontgomery.png\nPPAddisonMontgomery.png\nPPxAddisonMontgomery.png\nPPxAddisonMontgomery.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Addison-centric or otherwise very informative about her life.\n*[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\n*[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\n*[[Time Has Come Today]]\n*[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\n*[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\n*[[In Which We Meet Addison, a Nice Girl From Somewhere Else]]\n*[[In Which Addison Finds the Magic]]\n*[[In Which Addison Has a Very Casual Get Together]]\n*[[In Which Addison Finds a Showerhead]]\n*[[Before and After]]\n*[[Ex-Life]]\n*[[The Hard Part]]\n*[[Home Again]]\n*[[Apron Strings]]\n*[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\n*[[Hotter Than Hell]]\n*[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\n\n\n:'''Addison (to [[Jake Reilly|Jake]]):''' I love you.

She'd gotten pregnant with her husband's frozen sperm after his death. Amelia's CVS showed a trait that neither she nor her husband carried in the fetus. Naomi went over the records and found out that she and [[Zoe Salter]] had been implanted the same day and Zoe was a carrier for the trait, meaning Amelia was carrying Zoe's fetus and Zoe was carrying Amelia's, the last embryo from her dead husband's sperm. Naomi shared the news with Amelia and the Salters separately, but they figured out what had happened as they left. They'd met each other in the waiting room and bonded over their similar stories. Amelia wanted to continue the pregnancy and have Zoe do the same, saying she'd respect the Salters' wishes. However, Zoe said she and her husband wanted to terminate and start over with the other embryos they had stored. When Amelia heard that, she said if they terminated, she'd have the baby she was carrying and keep it.\n\nNaomi had Amelia talk to Violet about the pregnancy, reminding her that she could have the baby she was carrying, give it up, and still become a mother another way. She said the pregnancy was her happiness and she couldn't fathom letting it go.\n\nZoe later returned to the practice to talk to Amelia. Amelia told Zoe she wanted the baby she was carrying, but understood she couldn't make Zoe carry him. She believed that maybe it happened because the baby she was carrying, Zoe and Martin's, was her new chance. Naomi said sometimes, you have to let go of one dream so you can move forward with another one. Zoe said she couldn't let Amelia keep the baby, apologized, and left.\n\nZoe returned to the practice and suggested that she could continue to carry Amelia's baby while Amelia carried hers and they could switch them after they were born. ''(\"[[Yours, Mine & Ours]]\")''\n\n\nZoe and Amelia began seeing another OB for their pre-natal care. However, when he found something that might be wrong with the baby Zoe was carrying, he said they needed a surgical consult and recommended Addison. Addison did an ultrasound and diagnosed a fetal teratoma that was taking over the baby's blood supply. Addison recommended surgery, but advised Zoe that she'd have to perforate the uterus, which can sometimes cause problems for future pregnancies. Martin had left her because he didn't understand the bond between Zoe and Amelia and the decision they'd made. Zoe said she couldn't do it, so Addison recommended termination. Zoe decided she wanted to wait and left the fetus die in utero naturally, to get Amelia further along in her pregnancy. She didn't want Zoe to think she'd just given up. Addison wanted her to tell Amelia, but Zoe said that she couldn't.\n\nAmelia went to see Naomi, saying she thought something was wrong with the baby and Addison and Zoe were lying to her about it.\n\nThey called Zoe in and Naomi told her about what Amelia had said to her. She reminded her about the decision she'd made. Zoe said that she felt like both babies were both of theirs. If she told Amelia what she was going to do, it would be bad for Amelia's already-high blood pressure. She was already at risk for eclampsia and they could lose both babies. Addison again recommended the surgery. Naomi told her she either needed to let Addison operate or let her end the pregnancy because that was the safest choice if she wanted to get pregnant again. Zoe said she'd do it, but they needed to tell Amelia why the surgery couldn't be done because she couldn't do it.\n\nThey called Amelia in and told her about the teratoma. Amelia said she understood. She said she was worried at first that Zoe wouldn't try to make it work. When she heard they wanted to terminate, she told Zoe she wanted to be there for her. Her blood pressure was high, so they gave her oxygen, which helped. After seeing what Amelia was going through for the baby she was carrying, Zoe decided to take the risk and have the surgery.\n\nAddison operated. Zoe was fine afterward, but Addison was unable to save the baby. Amelia said it was okay because the baby she was carrying was still okay and they were a family. When Marty showed up and made up with Zoe, Amelia left. Naomi told her she couldn't leave and keep the baby, but Amelia said he was all she had left.\n\nMartin was enraged about Amelia leaving, but Zoe said she believed that Amelia was a good person and would come back. She explained to Martin her view of it, from the time she'd spent with Amelia while Martin was gone. ''(\"[[Strange Bedfellows]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married until her husband, Vic, died.\n\n\nWhile they were carrying each other's babies, she became close friends with Zoe, especially after Zoe's husband left. When Amelia left with Zoe and Martin's baby, Zoe believed she'd come back because of their friendship and Amelia being a good person.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPAmeliaSawyer.png|[[Yours, Mine & Ours]]\nPPAmeliaSawyer.png|[[Strange Bedfellows]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Amelia Sawyer Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sawyer, Amelia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Genetics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (REI)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She'd been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder at the age of seven after a car accident that killed their parents. Lara said it took a lot of therapy to get that under control, but she hadn't seen another personality in nearly ten years, so she was concerned that they were coming back.\n\nAndi then talked to Sheldon herself, believing her sister was worrying too much. When Sheldon started to talk to Andi about what her sister had said, Gina replied, telling him angrily to back off. Sheldon said it was very convincing.\n\nSheldon talked to Lara and her fianc\ue, [[Jack]], about Andi. Jack said he'd known Andi almost as long as he'd known Lara and he was suspicious because he hadn't seen any of her others before then, a week before they were set to move to Arizona. Lara said she couldn't leave Andi and Jack said he wouldn't go without her.\n\nSheldon called Andi back in and did art therapy with her, something her previous shrink liked to do a lot. While she colored, he talked to her about Jack. She said she was okay with the moving. She drew a picture of Jack and then suddenly became more aggressive in her drawing. When Sheldon asked her about it, she said she was Maggie, who said they don't care about Andi and asked how Lara could just walk out on her like that. Maggie said that she didn't like Jack because she was taking Lara away. Maggie then asked if she could draw, too. She used crayons and began to draw a childlike picture.\n\nSheldon was then convinced that it was real, because the pictures were completely different art styles and drawn with different hands.\n\nSheldon talked to all three of them together. Jack still believed Andi was manipulating them. Jack said that Andi was jealous of him and the time Lara spent with him. Gina then spoke and said he hated Jack. Sheldon then figured out that Andi was faking it, because Maggie had told him she hated Jack, not Gina.

It was nice feeling like she did.\n\nAt dinner, Angela interrogated Jake about his own love life. She figured out he liked someone and he told her about Addison. Angela said her mom would have wanted him to be happy.\n\nWhen Jake talked to Angela later, she said that she wanted to meet Addison at some point, though he said nothing was going to happen with them.\n\nAngela came to visit Jake at the office, where he introduced her to Addison. ''(\"[[The Letting Go]]\")''\n\n\nAngela started dating Eli, her human sexuality teacher. She introduced him to Jake when they met up at the movie theatre. Jake was surprised at the age difference.\n\nAngela and Jake later had lunch together and Jake expressed his disapproval at their relationship. She warned him not to make her choose because he wouldn't like her choice.\n\nAddison encouraged Jake to invite Angela and Eli over for dinner. After Jake threatened Eli during that dinner, Angela confronted Jake, saying she hoped Eli misunderstood and Jake didn't really threaten his life. She then left in anger. ''(\"[[The World According to Jake]]\")''\n\n\nAngela attended her father's wedding to Addison and served as his best man. When they danced at the reception, they talked about their argument and cleared the air.\n\n\nThree months later, Angela came to Jake and told him she was taking a semester off from school to go to Rome with Eli while he taught there. Later, before she left, she went to Jake, who apologized for his behavior and said that he only wanted her to be happy, even with Eli. He also said that no matter what, she'd be his girl. ''(\"[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\n\nEthan\nAngela dated her classmate Ethan for a period of time. Angela had sex for the first time with him. ''(\"[[The Letting Go]]\")'' Their relationship ended after a short period of time. Angela once said that Ethan was a stupid frat boy, and she was way too good for him. ''(\"[[The World According to Jake]]\")''\n\n[[Eli Wilson]]\nEli is Angela's professor at her college. They first met in his human sexuality class.\n\nAngela's father, Jake, disapproves of Eli because he is  years older than her. Despite the age difference, she says that she loves Eli. ''(\"[[The World According to Jake]]\")''\n\nShe later decided to go to Rome with Eli for a semester while he taught there. ''(\"[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nJake Reilly\nJake is Angela's father. He adopted her after falling in love with her mother. They remain close long after her mother's death.

At  weeks, she was on bed rest because of a blood clot. Even with heparin, she was forming more clots. Addison recommended reducing the pregnancy to one, but Angie and Simon opposed the idea.\n\nThe McConnells called in [[Vanessa Hoyt]] as a consult and she believed that it was safe for Kayla to continue the pregnancy as triplets.\n\nSam agreed to do the surgery on Kayla. It was successful.\n\nKayla was stable for a while after the surgery, but then she started forming clots above the umbrella. Addison rushed her into surgery to reduce the pregnancy load. Before she could do that, Kayla started throwing more clots and they needed to close and move her to ICU. Her heart stopped when a clot moved to her lung. There was no evidence of higher brain function and she was put on life support. The McConnells asked about the baby that was left and were told that the reduction hadn't been performed. As long as Kayla was on the ventilator, the babies would continue to grow. ''(\"[[Triangles]]\")''\n\nAs Kayla was in a coma, Eddie decided he wanted to turn the machines off, believing Kayla wouldn't want to live like that. Vanessa, opposing the decision, went to Simon and Angie and told them about it. They believed Kayla would want them to continue life support until the babies were born. Eddie still insisted he just wanted Kayla to have peace. The McConnells got a lawyer to prevent him from turning off the machines. Only essential medical personnel were allowed in Kayla's room while they waited for a judge to rule on what would happen.\n\nEddie waited outside Kayla's room in the hallway. He called some lawyers, but couldn't afford any of them. [[Charlotte King]] gave him the name of a lawyer at a non-profit aid group and encouraged him to call.\n\nThe judge came in and ruled that Kayla's life would have to continue until viability had been reached. She also ordered that her room continued to be closed to all but essential medical personnel.\n\nCharlotte later saw Eddie waiting outside Kayla's room, so she left the door unlocked and told him the nurse was on break. He went into her room and locked the door. He then disconnected her ventilator. They broke a window to get into the room, but before they could reconnect the ventilator, they saw that Kayla was breathing on her own. ''(\"[[Pulling the Plug]]\")''\n\nAfter six weeks in a coma, Eddie called in [[Geraldine Ginsberg]] to try to wake Kayla up. After she ran tests and examined Kayla, Ginsberg believed nothing could be done. However, [[Amelia Shepherd]], who was on Ginsberg's team, had an idea. Ginsberg believed it wouldn't work, so she refused to do it. When Ginsberg fired Amelia, she stayed to help Kayla. After speaking with Eddie, Amelia agreed to do the surgery.\n\nAfter hearing about what Amelia had planned, the McConnells asked her not to operate, to give them a little more time so the babies could mature more. Despite this, she operated. During the surgery, the three babies had to be delivered, but Amelia was then able to finish the procedure.\n\nAfter surgery, Kayla's reflexes started to re-emerge and she woke up.

Angie confessed that she'd been lying to him. For a while, she was on the pill, but then she got a cervical cap, which is why they hadn't conceived. She said she had her reasons and when pressed, she said she just didn't want kids, but Ray loved kids. Therefore, she couldn't just tell him she didn't want them.

He is a famous neurologist and author.\n\n\n\nArcher was born in [[Connecticut]] into a wealthy background along with his younger sister, [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addie]], and mother, [[Bizzy Forbes]].\n\nWhen Addison was seven, she fell off her bike in the vineyard while going downhill because her tire came off. She flipped over the handlebars and scraped her face, but Archer picked her up, told her it was going to be okay, and carried her the half mile back home. This is how Addison has always seen her brother, as the big brother who carried her home. ''(\"[[Acceptance]]\")''\n\n\nArcher came to Los Angeles without telling his sister he was coming. She discovered him on her kitchen floor, having sex. He told her he was there for a winter launch party for his publisher. After the party, he took Naomi home and had sex with her, upsetting his sister and Sam, who punched Archer when he found out. During the party, Archer told [[Kevin Nelson|Kevin]], Addison's boyfriend, that he wasn't good enough for her, causing him to doubt their relationship. Addison confronted Archer on that and told him he needed to leave. ''(\"[[Tempting Faith]]\")''\n\n\nArcher returned to Los Angeles when he was hired to replace [[Wyatt Lockhart]] at [[Pacific Wellcare Center]]. ''(\"[[Nothing to Fear]]\")''\n\nHis first case in Los Angeles was [[Jane Williams]], a pregnant woman who had had a stroke. He and Addison disagreed about her treatment but ultimately worked together to save her life and her baby. After the case was finished, Addison said that she was glad he was there, but he needed to stay out of her personal life. ''(\"[[Second Chances]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Archer had a tonic-clonic seizure after having sex with Naomi, she took him to the hospital. He insisted that he was okay and left the hospital against medical advice after telling Naomi not to tell Addison. When Naomi pushed, he admitted he had an inoperable glioma in his brain. Naomi cracked and told Addison, who got Archer's scans. While he was looking at his scans, they noticed upward-gaze palsy, which wasn't consistent with his diagnosis, so they got another CT scan. When they saw multiple lesions, Archer diagnosed himself with neurocysticercosis. Addison wanted to call Derek to see if he could remove them. Archer wanted to try antiparasitics instead. Addison pleaded with him, saying she wanted to fix it because she didn't want to lose him. When he had another seizure, he was admitted to the hospital and given a paralyzing agent in an attempt to stop the seizures. When that didn't work, the neurologist wanted to induce a coma. Once Archer was in the coma, Addison called Derek to see if he could help. ''(\"[[Acceptance]]\")''\n\nArcher was brought to Seattle for Derek to operate on him. He had to be stabilized in the ER before being taken to CT, which revealed that the single cyst from his previous CT had multiplied and he now had eight. They were clogging the left ventricle. Derek said surgery wasn't an option and Archer was going to die. He consulted with two other surgeons who agreed that it was inoperable. However, Addison encouraged him to try harder and Sam suggested that he think about it as if there were only one and work on a plan to extract them one at a time. Archer didn't believe Derek could do it and didn't want to have the surgery, but Derek goaded him into agreeing to the surgery by calling him a coward. He removed the first seven cysts easily, but the eighth cyst ruptured in his brain and released the worm into his brain. Archer's heart stopped, but Derek insisted on finding the worm before starting compressions. He found the worm and Archer stabilized. He was stable in his room after surgery. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\nArcher woke up after his surgery. Because his speech was still slurred and his vision was blurry, he was convinced that Derek missed something and demanded that he run a CT. Derek denied his request, saying his exam was normal. However, Archer went around him and the CT showed what looked like persistent cysts. He believed he was going to die, so he confessed to several embarrassing things. When Derek saw the CT, he came into Archer's room and explained the sacs had filled with fluid and would clear in a month. ''(\"[[Ex-Life]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Addison told Naomi that Archer was cheating on her, he decided to go back to New York. He left without saying anything to Naomi about it. ''(\"[[Wait and See]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Bizzy killed herself, the family gathered in Connecticut for a public memorial service and a private internment. The night before the memorial, Archer slept with Naomi. After the memorial, he got drunk. And at the internment, he cried. ''(\"[[Home Again]]\")''\n\n\n\nOn arrival in LA, Addison walked in on Archer having sex with a woman in her kitchen. ''(\"[[Tempting Faith]]\")''\n\n[[Naomi Bennett]]\nAfter his publisher's launch party, Archer took Naomi home and they had sex. ''(\"[[Tempting Faith]]\")''\n\nWhen he was hired by Pacific Wellcare and returned, they resumed their sexual relationship. ''(\"[[Nothing to Fear]]\")''\n\nNaomi enjoyed the sex, but she was upset to learn that Archer had a date with another woman. He said that he was the good-time guy and wasn't going to be her boyfriend. However, he showed up at her house instead of going on his date, saying he'd rather be with her. ''(\"[[Second Chances]]\")''\n\nWhen he believed he was dying, he lamented not being able to be a better man for her. ''(\"[[Ex-Life]]\")''\n\nShortly after his recovery, Addison caught him with another woman while Naomi believed they were monogamous. Not long after that, she caught him after sleeping with [[Charlotte King]]. She told Naomi that he was cheating and Naomi went to his office to find that he had left. ''(\"[[Wait and See]]\")''\n\nWhen Naomi came to Connecticut for Bizzy's funeral, she and Archer slept together. ''(\"[[Home Again]]\")''\n\n[[Charlotte King]]\nHe had sex once with [[Charlotte King]].

''(\"[[Serving Two Masters]]\")''\n\n\nAfter realizing that he couldn't protect his daughter from the people Heather hung out with, he decided to get a lawyer and fight her for custody. ''(\"[[Tempting Faith]]\")''\n\n\nBetsey was with Dell at the practice when a kid came in and was diagnosed with measles. She had also played with the kid, [[Michael Perkins]], in the waiting room. Unsure if Betsey had been vaccinated and unable to get a hold of Heather, Dell worried that Betsey could get measles. Cooper advised him to wait until Heather could be reached because he had  hours to vaccinate her. When he was finally able to get a hold of Heather at the end of the day, she admitted that she didn't know whether or not Betsey was vaccinated. ''(\"[[Contamination]]\")''\n\n\nHeather got promoted at her job, but the promotion meant moving to St. Louis. Dell refused to let Heather take Betsey, so Heather left in anger. When Dell showed up at the apartment to talk to Heather about it again, he found the apartment cleared out and both Heather and Betsey gone. ''(\"[[What Women Want]]\")''\n\n\nEventually, the pressure of her new job got to Heather and she relapsed. She brought Betsey back to Los Angeles and told Dell he could have her if he gave her $,. He got the money from Sam, but when she showed up, he said he wouldn't give her the money to kill herself, for Betsey's sake. He then told her to say goodbye to Betsey. She did so and left, leaving Betsey with Dell. ''(\"[[Yours, Mine & Ours]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Violet was attacked and hospitalized, Betsey went with Dell to the hospital, where they waited for news. ''(\"[[A Death in the Family]]\")''\n\n\nDell took some time off from work to take care of Betsey. When she started at a new school, she cried and clung to his leg when he dropped her off. ''(\"[[Pushing the Limits]]\")''\n\n\nBetsey was in the house with Heather when it exploded. Dell got Betsey out and they were both taken to the hospital. Heather had severe burns, but Betsey had only a minor brain contusion and carbon monoxide poisoning. Dell was told she'd wake in a few hours and she did. Once awake, Pete tried to get Dell to let her see Heather to say goodbye before Heather died. Dell refused, but Pete tried to sneak her there anyway. Right before they arrived, Dell showed up and took Betsey back to her room. Heather then died with only Pete by her side. ''(\"[[Blowups]]\")''\n\n\nSince their home was destroyed, Dell and Betsey moved in with Naomi. She refused to speak to her father, still angry at him for not letting her say goodbye to her mother. Dell eventually went to Betsey and admitted that he'd made a mistake and was trying to protect her. He apologized to her. ''(\"[[Another Second Chance]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Dell was injured in a car accident, he asked to have Betsey brought to him before he had to have brain surgery. He talked to her, saying that if something happened to him, it would be okay because she'd know that everything bad to happen in her life would have already happened, so she'd have good things happening after that. When Dell died in surgery, Pete had to tell Betsey, who started to punch him and cry. ''(\"[[The End of a Beautiful Friendship]]\")''\n\nBetsey was then left orphaned after the accident, ending up with Aunt Monica.\n\n\nAunt Monica showed up one day in OWG, telling Violet that she couldn't keep her for long, and left Betsey behind. Betsey colored and played in her dad's old office. Betsey was later taken home by Violet and Betsey asked if she could stay with them forever, but arguments ensued between Pete and Violet, Cooper and Charlotte, and Sam and Addison about keeping Betsey with them, with none of them willing to keep her for a greater stretch of time. After the discussion, it was decided that Betsey should be submitted to social services and put in foster care. ''(\"[[A Better Place to Be]]\")''\n\n\nA few months later, Betsey ended up in [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose Hospital's]] [[Emergency Room|ER]] because she fell down the stairs in her foster home. While she was being checked out, she said she didn't want to be there because her mommy and daddy died there. She had a brain contusion, but Amelia said the swelling could go down on its own. They did x-rays, which showed a recent clavicle fracture that had healed. Cooper became suspicious that her foster parents were abusing her. They monitored for a while, but when Betsey started seizing, they rushed her into surgery. Gina and Phil left to follow, leaving their son, Marshall, with Pete. Pete took Marshall to the cafeteria where they were joined by Sheldon. He asked Marshall about his parents. He said that when Betsey doesn't listen, he helps her to listen. He said that the jungle gym fall was her fault.\n\nIn surgery, Betsey started bleeding, so Amelia had to work to stop it. Meanwhile, Sheldon talked to the others, saying he believed Marshall would need help. They went to the Rakoffs about Marshall.\n\nAfter surgery, Betsey was stable, but comatose. After some time, Betsey woke up. When she learned that the Rakoffs had left, she asked where she was going to live. Naomi told her she was coming to live with her. ''(\"[[God Bless the Child]]\")''\n\n\nBecause Maya had been accepted to Columbia and Naomi wanted to be around to help her with Olivia and she and Gabriel became engaged, she moved Betsey with her to New York.

Believing that The Captain pushed Bizzy to do it, Addison talked to Bizzy about facing it, but Bizzy corrected her that she and Susan had been together for  years. Bizzy said that Susan was the one thing she did for\uaherself among all the things she did for her children. Seeing how upset having her parents there made Addison, Sam came to her house and told them to leave. They did so, but Addison came to the airport to see them off and talk\uato Bizzy, though they only talked about\uathe bad\uaservice she'd received on the flight to Los Angeles.

''(\"[[Just Lose It]]\")''\n\nSusan had stage IV ovarian cancer. Addison ran tests and then had to deliver the news that the cancer had spread and there was nothing she could do. Bizzy slapped Addison and commanded Addison to save Susan's life. Addison called in [[Eric Rodriguez]] and asked for his professional advice. He agreed that there was nothing there could do, but agreed to do some research and consult with colleagues. He suggested that Addison scope her. When Addison did the scope, she saw that the tumor had spread to her liver. She suggested not doing anything, but Bizzy kept pushing, so Addison suggested using the [[Da Vinci Surgical System]] to get angles she couldn't get with her own hands. Susan agreed to try it for Bizzy. Addison brought Eric in on the surgery to use hot chemo to kill the cancer cells left behind. They were able to remove the cancer and place her port for chemo.

When Addison went to check to see if Susan was dressed for the wedding, she discovered that Susan wasn't better.

After the wedding, Susan collapsed. ''(\"[[Heaven Can Wait]]\")''\n\n\nSusan was stabilized in the ER, but she was in septic shock.

Dell then took her to see him. The Sinclairs returned, saying that they wanted him still, but Judy said no, because they left when things were hard. She looked at the baby and said she was going to keep him.\n\nThe Sinclairs stopped by the practice to bring the things they'd bought for the baby, wanting him to have them even though they didn't have him. They explained that every time Carrie had a miscarriage or an adoption fell through, they felt like they'd lost a baby and didn't want to lose him. Naomi told Judy about the stuff they'd brought and said that she'd know what the right decision to make was. She ultimately decided to give the baby to the Sinclairs.

Casey said she didn't think she should worry about good grades or college when all she wanted was to be a mom, Jamie said it was instant status, and Lisa said babies love you no matter what. There's a lot going on at her house, so her mother can't give them all attention all the time.\n\nRicky came in late to their joint session. She'd told Jamie she needed to pick up her brother, but she came back with Violet's book, saying Violet wasn't the right therapist for their daughters. She took Jamie and left.\n\nSheldon and Violet took Casey and Lisa to tour the hospital. Casey and Lisa by that point had read Violet's book and made several comments about it. Violet started to fight back, but Casey started having serious abdominal pain and bleeding. She was rushed in for an emergency c-section. Lisa watched as Casey's baby was delivered and said it wasn't what she expected and left.\n\nCasey held her baby after his birth. Lisa had not come back. Jamie called and said she was giving her baby up for adoption. She felt her friends had abandoned the pact. Casey said her mom had only come by to criticize her and yell.

She is married to\ua[[Cooper Freedman]]\uawith whom she has four kids:\ua[[Mason Warner]], and\ua[[Georgia King-Freedman|Georgia]],\ua[[Caroline King-Freedman|Caroline]], and\ua[[Rachel King-Freedman]].\n\n\n\nShe is from Monroeville, Alabama.\n\nGrowing up, she was told, by her father, how sweet she was for taking care of her younger brothers.\n\nWhen she was fifteen, she had to shoot her horse Marjorie after it sprained its ankle. Marjorie was her last pet and when she thought she might have been pregnant, she thought about naming the baby Marjorie.\n\nShe always wanted to make her father, Big Daddy, proud, so she became a doctor.\n\n\nCharlotte met\ua[[Billy Douglas]], with whom she eventually married. At one point, she came home from the hospital after work and found him in bed with another woman. Charlotte lost her self control and dragged the woman off her husband and jumped Billy, yelling at him. The woman then grabbed a vase and smashed it on Charlotte's head, knocking her out. Billy called , but left before the paramedics arrived. Charlotte couldn't forgive him for what happened, ending the marriage<ref>[[If I Hadn't Forgotten...]], x (PP)</ref>.\n\n\nFollowing the attack, Charlotte became addicted to the pain medication. She tried to get her colleague, who treated her after the attack, to write her another prescription, but he was aware of the dangers of addiction. She tried to convince him saying she'd know when to stop as a doctor, but he only offered to write her a prescription for pills with a lighter effect. She declined and left.\n\nSome time later, drugged after a shift, Charlotte was driving her car through a storm. She began to fall asleep at the wheel and deviated from her lane. She didn't notice the car approaching in the opposite direction, causing the other driver to have to get out of the way, slipping and crashing into a pole. The crash brought Charlotte back to her senses. She pulled over and went to help the woman, but the woman had flown through her windshield. Charlotte called , but the woman didn't make it. The truth about the accident was never uncovered, as the woman was deemed a careless driver for not wearing a seat belt and Charlotte never told the truth.\n\n\nCooper and Charlotte first started dating after meeting on a sex site. They didn't expect the person they'd agreed to meet to be each other, but they agreed to give it a shot. Their relationship started out with just being \"Friends with Benefits,\" but Cooper wanted it to be more. Charlotte wasn't open to that until she realized that she was falling in love with Cooper. The two were on and off after Charlotte admitted to having sex with [[Archer Montgomery]]. Cooper forgave her, but then they got into another argument when Cooper found out Charlotte was the new owner of the competing clinic right below Oceanside Wellness. They eventually made up.\n\n\nAfter telling Cooper that she had become more of an administrative position at St. Ambrose and less of a doctor, she took a job interview. She had been recruited to run the [[Pacific Wellcare Center]] on the newly leased fourth floor of the building that also housed [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. Charlotte kept this from Cooper, but was found out by Violet. Violet agreed to keep the secret so that Charlotte had the chance to come clean about it to Cooper. After giving her several chances, Charlotte did not tell Cooper and so Violet confronted Cooper. Cooper became very angry that Charlotte was running an opposing medical practice in his building and they broke up.\n\n\nAfter William White fired Charlotte from her position at Pacific Wellcare Center, she approached Sam for a position at Oceanside Wellness Group and explained why she was a good hire for the practice. Sam and Addison had a conversation about it, and eventually decided to hire her. She moved into Pete's old office and practiced as a [[Sexology|sexologist]].\n\n\nIn [[St. Ambrose Hospital]] as [[Chief of Staff]], she told a noisy patient to wait his turn. However, that man had mental problems. He thought that women had to respect him and because Charlotte was mean to him, he assaulted her later that day.\uaGetting ready to go home, Charlotte left her office in the hospital. When she turned around after having closed the door, the man knocked her head against the door and dragged her back into her office.<ref>[[All in the Family]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nShe tried to resist and scratched the assaulter, which only enraged him more. He continued punching her eventually raped her in her own office.\uaShortly after, she left her office, bruised and bleeding. She hobbled to the nearest supply closet to get some bandages, but Pete Wilder, who was working in the ER that night, noticed her. He followed her and caught her when she fell down. He carried her into a room in the hospital.\n\nCharlotte chose not to tell anyone that she was raped and even hurt badly, she continued bossing everyone at the hospital around. She only allowed nurse Sheila in her room, not any of the \"nosy bitchy ones\" and the doctors from the practice. However, Addison didn't buy the story that the assaulter took her wallet and she asked everyone to leave the room. When they were alone in the room, Charlotte came clean to Addison. She told her that she was raped. Addison did a pelvic exam and tried to pursue Charlotte to report the assault, but Charlotte refused. However, Addison secretly did a rape kit and kept it in the hospital under the name of Jane Doe, thinking Charlotte might want the assaulter's DNA later.<ref>[[Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nSome time later, Charlotte returned to work, but she still hadn't fully recovered yet. Upon entering her office, she started getting flashbacks of the assault and she went to the practice instead. Her colleagues there tried to act normal around her, but they all failed to do so. Sheldon was the only one who actually left her alone like she wanted them to. Pete came into her office to check on her wounds, reminding Charlotte of the rape and she almost started crying in front of him. Violet offered to help her too, but Charlotte refused, saying it was impossible for Violet to know what she was going through. She also completely shut out Addison, because Addison saw her at her most fragile point. Amelia offered her donuts and said she was going to meetings for addicts. She also talked to her about craving to pills after something terrible happened, but Charlotte denied she was craving for pills.\n\nAddison eventually told Sam that Charlotte was raped. On his turn, he asked Violet to talk to Charlotte without actually saying that she was raped. However, Violet suspected something and talked to Pete, who suspected the same. When talking with Violet in his office about the night Charlotte was assaulted, Sheldon said he was in the police office talking to a rapist. Seeing the way Violet reacted to the word \"rapist\", he asked her if Charlotte was raped. Violet said she also suspected that Charlotte was raped.\n\nCooper told Charlotte he simply couldn't leave her alone after what happened. This seemed to help her deal with it a little bit better, as she dared to enter her office again shortly after, without having flashbacks. Violet later came to Charlotte's office, and she started talking about the time she was raped herself, leaving Charlotte devastated. She went to Amelia's office and asked her to go to a meeting with her, admitting she was craving pills.\uaMeanwhile, Addison made calls to have the pelvic washings from Charlotte processed.<ref>[[What Happens Next]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nWhen Erica Warner showed up at the practice claiming that Cooper was the father of her son, Cooper was delighted and immediately believed her. Charlotte was more cautious. At first, she approached Erica and paid her money to leave Cooper alone. Erica took the money, but only to give it back to Cooper as that was not what she was after. She wanted to disappear from his life, but Cooper convinced her he had nothing to do with it. Charlotte later realized that she crossed a line, but she only did so to protect her family. She did a paternity test behind Cooper's back, which revealed that Mason was indeed his son.\n\nErica then allowed Cooper to come visit his son, but didn't allow Charlotte be near him, so Charlotte kept her distance. Over time, Erica came to realize that Charlotte had meant no harm and she noticed that Mason had grown to like Charlotte, and vice versa. She then allowed Mason to spend the night at Cooper and Charlotte's, and Mason and Erica progressively became part of their family.\n\n\n\nCharlotte was frustrated when she discovered she was pregnant. While she had happily accepted being Mason's mother, she was not interested in having more kids. She then became horrified upon finding out that she was expecting triplets. While abortion was not an option for her because of her faith, she did hope for a miscarriage in the early stages of the pregnancy. That didn't happen and the family began to prepare for the three new additions.\nAddison had to sew up Charlotte's cervix after she had one of the babies prematurely at only twenty-six weeks.\n\n\nGenerally, the character has served as somewhat of a foil to the other doctors at [[Oceanside Wellness Group]], often impeding their progress in helping patients through somewhat unorthodox methods by applying and enforcing legal, medical and ethical implications. However, while being treated for insomnia, Charlotte revealed that she has trouble connecting with others because signs of affection were discouraged in her family. She later became less obstructive and the relationship with [[Cooper Freedman|Cooper]] somewhat humanized her..\n\n\n\n[[Billy Douglas]]\nAt Oceanside Wellness, Charlotte told a patient that she married her first love and they had a fairy tale-like relationship. However, she caught him in their bed having sex with another woman. She couldn't forgive him for that, and they broke up.\n\nBefore Charlotte married Cooper, she talked with Billy about their marriage. It turned out Billy was gay and cheated on her because he wanted to know if he'd feel different with another woman, but he said he didn't.\n\n[[Cooper Freedman]]\nMuch later, she started up a relationship with Cooper Freedman after meeting through an internet dating service. They stayed together for a while, but after they broke up, she began to feel sick which made Cooper think that she was pregnant. After he convinces Charlotte that she might be pregnant, she takes a pregnancy test and while they are waiting for the results, they begin to think of names and when they see that the test came back negative, Charlotte tries to get back together with Cooper, but he refuses.\n\nFollowing the death of her father, Cooper goes with her and comforts her and they eventually get back together, but Charlotte dislikes Cooper living with Violet and they argue over that. Charlotte creates another roadblock in their relationship when she sleeps with [[Archer Montgomery]] and is caught by [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]], but Cooper sees this as a sign of her pushing him away, and he forgives her. Eventually, Charlotte begins to bond with Violet over Cooper and her pregnancy, but eventually they part ways when she reveals that she slept with [[Archer Montgomery]] and Violet tells her, professionally and personally, that it's not okay that she did that. Charlotte and Cooper stay together and eventually have a [[Something Old, Something New|Vegas wedding]].\n\nHer relationship with Cooper took kind of a blow when she found out that Cooper has a son and Charlotte tried to pay Mason's mother to leave them alone, but they eventually reconciled. Charlotte developed motherly feeling for Mason when it became clear that his mother would die.\n\nCharlotte became pregnant with triplets which both she and Cooper refer to as the 'Cooplets'. Charlotte went into premature labor and [[Life Support|delivered the first triplet]], whom they later named Georgia. Two months later, [[Full Release|she delivered the last two triplets]]. Because she named Georgia, Mason named the second baby Caroline, and Cooper chose Rachel for the third.\n\n[[Sheldon Wallace]]\nCharlotte and Sheldon started sleeping together after Charlotte and Cooper broke up. She stated to [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] that the rumors about Sheldon's penis are true. She used sex with Sheldon to cover up the pain of her and Cooper's break up. Sheldon eventually realized this and broke it off with Charlotte, advising her to pursue Cooper since she was still in love with him. Sheldon and Charlotte remained friends and he gave her advice on how to be friends with Cooper and how to eventually get him back. Sheldon stopped the elevator with Addison in it to tell her that he loved Charlotte. He couldn't stop thinking about her and kept going to her office to borrow postage stamps even though he paid his bills online.<ref>[[In the Name of Love]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n[[Archer Montgomery]]\nCharlotte had a sexual affair with Archer in his office at [[Pacific Wellcare Center]]. Charlotte did this to hurt Cooper, because she was afraid of their growing relationship and wanted it to blow up in her face.\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\n[[Naomi Bennett]]\n\n\nDr. King is a graduate of [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]] and is the [[Chief of Staff]] at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]] in [[Santa Monica]].\n\nShe also opened a rival practice, [[Pacific Wellcare Center|Pacific Wellcare]]\ualocated on the fourth floor of the same building as the Oceanside Wellness Group.<ref>[[Know When to Fold]], x (PP)</ref>\uaThe owner of the practice, [[William White]], fired Charlotte as director of Pacific Wellcare and hired Naomi to replace her. His reasoning was that good leaders have a heart, and not only capable of attracting and hiring quality doctors.<ref>[[Yours, Mine & Ours]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nFollowing the revelation that [[Cooper Freedman|Cooper]] is broke and that the remaining staff at the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]] are looking to buy Naomi's share of the business, Charlotte gives [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] and [[Sam Bennett|Sam]] a check for Cooper's share, as well as a blank check for her to buy into the practice.<ref>[[Pushing the Limits]], x (PP)</ref> After much debate between Addison and Sam, including Charlotte confronting Sam, Sam and Addison decided to hire Charlotte as a new member of staff at Oceanside Wellness.<ref>[[Strange Bedfellows]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nCharlotte moved into Pete's old office after his move to the rival practice, offering sexology as her specialty. Charlotte had had that idea for a long period of time. She hired a web designer to build her a website that allows her to offer advice, as well as provide consultations by email and book appointments to see her.\n\n\n*There is an inconsistency in where Charlotte graduated from medical school. In Private Practice promotional material, it claims she is a Yale graduate, whereas Cooper claims she is a Johns Hopkins graduate. It's possible that she attended Yale for medical school and completed her residency at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]].<ref>[[Homeward Bound]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Charlotte has neonatal rounds at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]], which she has asked [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] to cover for her when she returned home to see her father.<ref>[[Homeward Bound]], x (PP)</ref> Since [[Chief of Staff]] is a bureaucratic and administrative role, it is assumed that these rounds are part of her duties as a [[Urology|urologist]] at St. Ambrose, indicating that Charlotte practices pediatric urology.\n*Charlotte is the only character of the original main characters of ''Private Practice'' to never appear in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' episode. She has, however, visited\ua[[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].<ref>[[You Break My Heart]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Charlotte was revealed to be a [[Surgery|surgeon]] in \"[[Strange Bedfellows]]\", specializing in [[Urology|urology]], electing sexology as a new specialty to practice at Oceanside Wellness.\n*[[Pete Wilder]]\uawas her work husband.

Claudine was even acting as a surrogate so that Lorraine and her husband, [[Elliott]], could have a baby. After Lorraine's exam, Claudine had abdominal pain, so Pete called in Addison to check her out.\n\nWhen Addison came to examine her, Pete was shocked to see Claudine and Elliott kissing. Elliott said it wasn't a tawdry affair. Before the cancer, things weren't great between him and Lorraine. Then the cancer happened and he and Claudine teamed up to take care of her. They spent a lot of time together and bonded over their shared experience. The feelings got stronger until they gave into them. Elliott planned to tell Lorraine after the baby was born. They were planning for him to leave Lorraine so they could be together.\n\nAddison said Claudine was in the very early stages of labor. Because her OB was out of town, she asked Addison to deliver the baby. She also refused to tell Lorraine about the affair. Lorraine had always wanted to be a mom, but Claudine didn't want kids. She only wanted to fall in love. It had never happened for her until Elliott.\n\nWhen the baby went into distress, Elliott comforted Claudine before she was taken for an emergency c-section, leading Lorraine to figure out they'd been having an affair. After the baby was delivered, Claudine had a lot of bleeding.\n\nAfter her surgery was completed, Addison told Claudine she'd had to perform a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding, meaning Claudine wouldn't be able to carry more children.

Lorraine confronted them and said she wanted the baby. Elliott said it wasn't hers and they'd go to court if necessary. Elliott tried to get Claudine to leave, but she said the baby wasn't hers. It was Lorraine's. She asked Lorraine for forgiveness, but Lorraine said she couldn't. They'd never been what they were before, but she could still be a good aunt to Lorraine's baby.

He worked with an electronic arm, which gave him previous unattainable range of motion and the ability to catch a tossed object out of the air. The arm was connected directly to his nervous system, so he merely had to think about moving the arm and it moved. While working with the arm, Colin suddenly felt extreme pain in his residual limb. Pete was shocked to see a bolt implanted directly into the end of Colin's arm. [[Gabriel Fife]] had sent him to Sweden to have the surgery, which is illegal in the US. He had a serious infection around the bolt and Pete took him to the hospital. It had been hurting for a month, but he hadn't said anything because he was worried he wouldn't be able to keep the arm. Pete said they needed to remove the bolt, but Gabriel and Colin asked him about other options. Pete said there were alternative options, but the FDA hadn't done safety studies on them, so he recommended just removing the bolt, because it was the source of the infection. Colin explained to Pete that he wanted to be able to dip his fianc\uee at their wedding and needed two arms to do that, but Pete was adamant because it could kill him.\n\nDespite Pete's recommendation, Gabriel looked into the drug protocols and decided to try one, despite the risks. Colin said he had tingling in his arm, like it was asleep and he couldn't wake it up. He had developed neurotoxicity, so Gabriel decided to lower the dose. Despite this, Colin continued to get worse as his infection spread. Pete came in and started a central line for antibiotics. Pete told Gabriel to remove the bolt, but he again refused because Colin didn't want it.\n\nGabriel told Colin the results weren't what they hoped, with the infection. He said they'd need to remove the bolt and the surround tissue. It might involve amputation the rest of his arm. However, Pete suggested that they could do antibiotic implants, which would give him the chance to keep the part of his arm he had left.\n\n\n\nHe became engaged before he deployed. They planned the whole wedding via letter while he was gone, including the dance, which involved him dipping her.

It's how we learn.|Cooper Freedman}}\n\n'''Cooper Freedman''' is a [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]] at [[Seaside Health and Wellness]]. He is married to [[Charlotte King]], with whom he has three daughters, [[Georgia King-Freedman|Georgia]], [[Caroline King-Freedman|Caroline]] and [[Rachel King-Freedman]] and a son, [[Mason Warner]].\n\n\n\nCooper was adopted as a child but he never sought out his biological parents as his adoptive parents were great. He grew up in Shaker Heights, Ohio in Cuyahoga County. Around the age of , Cooper found out that his adoptive parents had a son named Andy, who died a couple of years before they adopted him. This made him extremely mad at his parents, as he believed they only adopted him to fill the void. He later realized that they truly loved him and that he wasn't a replacement, but the situation left him with a deep fear of being someone's second choice.\n\n\nHe involved himself with the law several times with a patient who was seen as kidnapped by his non-custodial father. It turned out that he did not like his step-father and that he felt that he took his mother from his father. The patient turned out to be abusing himself so that his mother would believe him, but only his father did, so they ran away. Cooper later helped him, as he and his father lived out of a car. He also didn't call the police to report the missing child.\n\n\nOne day while at work, a woman named [[Erica Warner]] approached Cooper. Cooper realized that they had a one night stand years ago in his car. Erica then introduced a young boy named [[Mason Warner|Mason]] and said that he was Cooper's son. After Erica died, Charlotte and Cooper got full custody of Mason. Right after his mother's death, Mason refused to talk to Cooper and Charlotte, but after some time, Mason bonded with both Cooper and Charlotte.\n\n\nCooper and Charlotte became pregnant with triplets. Cooper did his best to support his wife, who didn't even want kids in the first place, which is why he was over the moon when she became pregnant with triplets. One of the babies was born prematurely, but with the dedicated support from her parents and friends, she pulled through. With some extraordinary measures taken, the other two babies stayed in utero long enough to be born naturally and around the due date.\n\nAfter the birth of their triplets, Charlotte and Cooper agreed he would stay home to take care of them while she returned to work, but Cooper soon found out three kids were too much to handle. They hired people to help out and both Cooper and Charlotte returned to work at the practice and St. Ambrose, all the while raising their four kids.\ua\n\n\nViolet described him in her book as a \"man child.\" Despite this description, Cooper is a very good pediatrician. He goes beyond everything to make sure his patients are safe, sometimes even crossing legal borders.\n\n\n\nCooper has problems meeting women because he says that he cannot socialize with people over the age of twelve (because of his profession). So instead of dating face-to-face, Cooper prefers internet dating. These online relationships almost never work out and he is always left humiliated. For example, Cooper got his car stolen from a woman he met online called \"SexyBoobs\".<ref>[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]], x</ref>\n\n[[Charlotte King]]\nCooper \"[[In Which Cooper Finds a Port in His Storm|met]]\" [[Charlotte King]], who is Chief of Staff at the local hospital and someone he knows professionally, through an on-line dating site. She was completely embarrassed by this and walked away from the date, and attempted to avoid Cooper thereafter, but later, she agreed to have a drink with Cooper, but instead, the two ended up having sex and later entered into a relationship.\n\nCooper and Charlotte did eventually break up, but Cooper still tried to get Charlotte back and was supportive of her when she believed she was pregnant. Charlotte disliked the relationship between Cooper and Violet and this was usually the point of issue in their relationship.\n\nFollowing the death of her father, Charlotte asked Cooper to marry her. He initially accepted, but later changed his mind as he wanted their wedding to be a proper wedding, and not a spur of the moment, grief-coping mechanism wedding, although they do eventually [[Something Old, Something New|marry in Vegas]].\n\nCharlotte later became pregnant with female triplets. Charlotte [[Life Support|prematurely delivered]] the first triplet, later named Georgia. Cooper stayed with the baby while she was in the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]]. For a while, she was on a ventilator, but eventually she was able to breathe on her own. Charlotte later [[Full Release|delivered]] the other two triplets. Since Charlotte named Georgia, Mason named the second baby Caroline, and Cooper named the third Rachel.\n\n[[Erica Warner]]\nErica Warner is a one-night stand from Cooper's past. Years later, she arrives at Cooper's workplace and tells him she has a kid, Mason Warner, and Cooper's the father.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nCooper kissed Amelia while engaged to Charlotte, but Amelia pushed him off and remained friends.\n\n\nCooper is a very caring father for his four children. After the birth of his three daughters, he was a stay at home dad, but it was too much for him, so he demanded that Charlotte hire a nanny.\n\nWalter\nCooper has a grandfather named Walter who was a piano tuner. He suggested Walter as a possible name when he and Charlotte thought she was pregnant.<ref>[[Know When to Fold]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n[[Violet Turner]]\nCooper has always been extremely close to [[Violet Turner]] having a friends only relationship with her. He helped her get through her multiple break ups with Allan. They once attempted to have \"friends, with benefits\" arrangement, but Cooper found it too weird.\n\nWhen Violet became pregnant, she asked Cooper to move in with her to take care of her as her pregnancy progressed.\n\nDuring the attack on Violet by the schizophrenic patient Katie, Cooper was standing outside the house. He later blamed himself for not being there, when Violet needed him most.\n\n[[Sam Bennett]]\n\n[[Pete Wilder]]\n\n\nDr. Cooper Freedman is a [[Board Certification|board certified]] [[Board Certification#American Board of Pediatrics|pediatrician]].

''(\"[[The Time Has Come]]\")''\n\n\nSam brought Corinne back to his place. He gave her medicine, which she took willingly. He then took her to the practice and consulted with Sheldon, who said her previous doctors had been lazy. They hadn't properly diagnosed her. They'd just over-drugged her, which left her glassy-eyed and unable to function. Sheldon said they could take her off the meds and find a true diagnosis.\n\nOnce the fog lifted, Sheldon asked if she'd been officially diagnosed. She said she'd been diagnosed schizophrenic, manic-depressive, and had paranoid delusions. Every shrink had a different idea, but they all just drugged her.\n\nWhile she was in the bathroom, Sam talked about Corinne's history and her past behaviors. Sheldon decided to keep her on a mild sedative only, because they weren't sure what to expect from her. Sam later sat next to Corinne as she lay on a beach chair looking out at the ocean. ''(\"[[Too Much]]\")''\n\nAfter the medical fog had lifted, Corinne came in to see Sheldon again. She said she felt good. She'd gotten up at six and done several tasks before her session. She said she wasn't sure where to start talking about her past, so Sheldon suggested they focus on the present because they had limitations on what could be done. Despite this, Corinne believed she was ready.\n\nSam later confronted Sheldon about being pessimistic, but Sheldon said she seemed manic in their session. During a conversation that night, Sam found out Corinne had been back in LA for five years and hadn't contacted her family.\n\nIn her next session with Sheldon, Corinne was subdued and withdrawn. She said she fantasized about an earthquake hurting her and believed she was a waste of skin. He told her she had bipolar disorder and there were treatments they could use to lesson the swings, but Corinne believed it was hopeless. ''(\"[[You Break My Heart]]\")''\n\nCorinne continued to see Sheldon. She had a notebook in which she wrote down all her moods. She also told him Sam had suggested she try to get a part-time job or volunteer. She worried about letting him down if she couldn't keep the job. ''(\"[[Andromeda]]\")''\n\n\nThat night, Addison found Corinne outside, manic and frantically writing down information about stars. Sam was able to get her back inside, but they had a rough night. The next day, she brought food for everyone in the practice and was still very manic. Sam was able to get her to leave with him, but that night, she was convinced she'd discovered a new galaxy and needed to write it all down. There was a struggle and Corinne went through Sam's porch door, cutting her face and arms.\n\nSam took her to the ER, where Pete removed the shards of glass and stitched her cuts. Sheldon told Sam that Corinne needed in-patient care, but he refused as he'd already lost  years with her. ''(\"[[Andromeda]]\")''\n\nWhen she woke up the next morning, Corinne was apologetic about what had happened, though Sam claimed it wasn't a big deal. Sheldon continued to press Sam to get her in-patient care. Corinne told Sam she wanted to go home, but he said she wasn't ready to go home yet. When she said being in the hospital felt like being a prisoner, he agreed to take her home.\n\nAt home, Corinne said she was having suicidal thoughts, but she said she didn't have the courage to commit suicide. Because of that, Sam tried to suicide-proof the house, including getting rid of all the knives in the house. Sam said that if she was going to stay there, there had to be rules, such as taking all her medicine, eating, and sleeping. When she refused to take her meds, they had a physical altercation during which he forced her to take her pills.\n\nSam then went to Sheldon to ask him for more information about in-patient care for Corinne. Sam then went to talk to Corinne about it. She tried to refuse, but Sam said she needed the care they could provide that he couldn't. As they did her intake, Corinne said she never should have called Sam before entering the ward. ''(\"[[The Letting Go]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe and Sam were close as children, but they spent  years apart as adults that put distance between them. The week before Corinne left, Sam told his mom he didn't want a birthday party because he didn't want Corinne to ruin it like she ruined everything, so he blamed himself for her leaving. She assured him that she hadn't left because of him, but because she was sick. ''(\"[[You Break My Heart]]\")''\n\n\n*She once almost burned the house down making popcorn. She thought the fire looked cool, so she fanned the flames to make it bigger instead of trying to put it out.<ref>[[Too Much]], x (PP)</ref>\n*She and Sam used to go to a beach house in North Carolina during the summers.<ref>[[Too Much]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPxCorinneBennett.png|[[The Time Has Come]]\nPPxCorinneBennett.png|[[Too Much]]\nPPxCorinneBennett.png|[[You Break My Heart]]\nPPxCorinneBennett.png|[[Andromeda]]\nPPxCorinneBennett.png|[[The Letting Go]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Corinne Bennett Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bennett, Corinne}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Her having an imaginary friend wasn't the problem. The problem is that she believes he's real. He wanted to prescribe anti-psychotics. Time was critical because she was pre-pubescent and starting the medicine early gave her a shot at a functional adulthood.\n\nThey met with her parents and talked about her situation. Her father, Joe, denied it, saying she was just a creative kid. He and his wife, Cyndy, then left.\n\nCyndy returned to the practice alone and said she had concerns about Maggie. She believed Sheldon was right and she didn't know what to do because her husband wasn't seeing it.\n\nThey called Maggie back in and her parents and Cooper watched through the glass while Maggie talked to Sheldon. He asked her about Eli and she admitted that sometimes Eli made her do things she didn't want to do, like drowning her cat.\n\nJoe was still adamant that he didn't want to send Maggie away and didn't believe the diagnosis was correct.

They started arguing and James forced them both to leave.\n\nViolet talked to Sarah about her home life and her parents' arguing. She said that her parents' fighting made her want to run away.\n\nWhen Violet asked to talk to each of the parents separately, they started to bicker and Sarah came out of her bay to yell at them to stop. Dana went to sit with her while Ron went to talk to Violet.\n\nRon told Violet that he'd slept with his assistant and when he told Dana about it, she threw him out and refused any attempt at reconciliation. He also told Violet that Sarah was the best thing in his life and he'd never hurt her. Violet asked to sit down with both of them, but Dana started arguing. Violet said that them fighting was damaging Sarah and they needed to stop. Dana went to give Sarah the ice cream she'd gotten, but Sarah wasn't in her bed. Dana looked frantically around the ER for Sarah while Charlotte called a Code Pink.\n\nThey searched the hospital for Sarah while Ron and Dana waited. Violet gave Dana a sedative to calm her down, but Ron refused one, saying he wanted to stay clear. They found Sarah's raincoat on a bench outside the hospital and told her parents she wasn't anywhere in the hospital. She was officially missing.

''(\"[[The Next Episode]]\")''\n\n\nRon and Dana continued to search for Sarah. Six weeks after her disappearance, they were seeing Violet about their grief. Dana was using sedatives to cope with the feelings. Violet suggested they start weaning her off the drugs, but Ron said it was the only way she could get through the day. Ron later called Violet when Dana crawled into Sarah's bed and wouldn't move. Violet said she didn't know where Sarah was or what would happen, but they needed to move forward instead of staying still. ''(\"[[The World According to Jake]]\")''\n\nIn a later session, Dana was upset because Ron had returned to work to pay the bills. She felt he was trying to move on and pretend they never had a daughter, but he said that the time he was at work was time he got to escape what was happening to them. He told Dana that Sarah was dead. He couldn't pretend to hope anymore. Dana said she knew that Sarah was still alive. Ron said he needed to believe she was dead because if she was alive, he couldn't cope with the things that must have happened to her.

Tammy's arm was broken when her father threw her across the room and Michelle was beaten. However, Darren's injuries were the most severe. Michelle had stabbed him nine times. Cooper splinted Tammy's arm and said they'd cast it later. He also asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said she couldn't. He said that people wanted to help her and she could talk about it later. She was worried about her dad.\n\nSam examined Darren and ordered a head CT. Darren asked if he'd be okay and asked about Michelle and Tammy. Sam told him it was a little late to be worried about them.\n\nSince Michelle was pregnant, Addison did an ultrasound and said that the baby looked fine for ten weeks. She then asked Michelle if Darren hitting her and Tammy happened often. Michelle said it was an accident and asked to see Tammy. Addison asked again about the attack. Michelle said it wasn't like that. She said she was cooking. She and Darren started arguing and Tammy got in the way, so Darren pushed her. She got mad, overreacted, and stabbed him. As Addison took her to see Tammy, police officers showed up at the hospital to arrest Michelle. Addison said she needed medical care, so they told Addison to admit her to the jail ward and handcuffed her.\n\nMichelle and Darren had conceived with assistance from Naomi because they wanted a sibling for Tammy.\n\nDarren continued to insist to Sam that it was an accident. Darren had a seizure due to a brain contusion, which caused swelling in his brain. Sam put him in a drug-induced coma. They gave him mannitol to try to reduce the swelling in his brain.\n\nMichelle maintained that Darren wasn't abusive, even when Addison advised her that she could go to jail if Darren died.\n\nCooper talked to Tammy about her dad being in a coma. He asked her to talk about what happened because her mom wasn't talking. He wanted her to tell the truth about what happened. She admitted that she was supposed to say it was an accident, but it wasn't. She was cutting a cantaloupe. Her dad came in and was being silly, singing along with the radio, but she got mad. She just gets so mad sometimes. Her dad could see that was happening. He held her to try to calm her down, but she bit him. He called for her mom, but Tammy still had the knife in her hand and stabbed him. And she was upset because he was going to die.\n\nWhen Michelle was released from custody, she realized that meant that Tammy told the truth about what had happened. She believed it was her fault because she'd used drugs during her pregnancy with Tammy. Tammy had ADHD and then the rages started. Her school counselor said it was just adolescence, but Michelle was convinced it was her fault, because the test hadn't showed any other cause. She said Darren was the strong one and she needed him, but he was in a coma and she was worried Tammy would be taken away.\n\nWhen juvenile officers came to take Tammy, Cooper asked to keep Tammy in the hospital for longer. He went to Tammy's room and found her in a rage, attacking a nurse. He restrained her an ordered lorazepam to calm her down.\n\nThe next day, Cooper consulted with Addison. Everything Cooper ran was negative, but Addison ordered an abdominal MRI, which showed an ectopic pheochromocytoma on her ovary. It released the excess adrenaline, which caused the rages. Addison told Michelle and Tammy about it and assured Michelle that nothing she did caused it. It was a simple surgery to remove it and then she wouldn't have the rage anymore. Tammy said she still felt guilty about her father.\n\nDarren was still in his coma when Addison took Tammy into surgery. He wasn't a surgical candidate, but wasn't waking up.\n\nCooper talked to Tammy about her guilt, saying it wasn't her fault and he knew that people saying that wasn't making her feel better.

He'd suffocated because Dave left him in the car.\n\nNaomi asked the Walkers to sit down with Sheldon. He asked about why they didn't tell Naomi about Max and their grief process. Dave replayed the day. He'd taken the baby to day care, which was normally Kendra's job. He went to work like he normally did and forgot that his son was in the backseat. While he was sitting at work, his screen saver popped up, his son's face, and he remembered. He ran out to the car, but it was too late. Sheldon asked Kendra about her feelings. She said she didn't hate her husband, but she did feel numb. She needed to try to start over. Despite the situation, Sheldon cleared them to use a surrogate.\n\nBecause their surrogate had uterine scarring, they needed Addison to operate on her in order to allow her to carry a baby.

When David left to get coffee, Joanna started crying, so Violet offered her a tissue. Joanna opened up to Violet, saying that her husband used to be supportive of her work as a lawyer, but had recently stopped supporting that. She'd made partner, but things hadn't slowed down. She said that it changed something in David. She'd come to LA to get away, but David followed and was apologetic about what he'd said and done. Violet asked what he'd done and Joanna confessed that David had hit her.\n\nShe said that his hours had been cut at work while hers were getting worse, so he was always home and stewing. She also said it was partially her fault. She cancelled a run with him last minute. She texted her assistant about missing the conference call she was supposed to be on and he hit her. She hadn't told anyone what happened, even her mother, whom she was visiting.\n\nWhen David returned, Violet sent Joanna to the bathroom, saying she'd meet her there. In the bathroom, they talked more about the abuse, but Joanna insisted that she was just making a reasonable sacrifice and Violet didn't know anything about her marriage.\n\nAs they prepared to board their flight, Violet implored Joanna not to get on the plane. She said that if she couldn't talk to her mother or friends, she could talk to Violet. She slipped Joanna her card as David tried to rush her onto the plane.\n\nViolet later got a call from Joanna, who hadn't gotten on the plane. ''(\"[[God Laughs]]\")''\n\n\nJoanna came to the practice six months later, pregnant and badly beaten. Violet and Addison took her to the ER where they determined she was  weeks pregnant. David came in and Violet and Pete tried to stop him from seeing her, but he said that the day at the airport was his wake-up call. He'd done therapy and anger management and they were doing so much better. He insisted that he wasn't the one who had beaten her.\n\nAfter her exam, Addison told David Joanna was bleeding into her abdomen and she wasn't able to detect a fetal heartbeat. She'd lost the pregnancy because of the trauma. Addison also said there was a tear in Joanna's uterus and she might have to do a hysterectomy to stabilize her. David told her to do it. Addison said she might be able to do it without the hysterectomy, but it was riskier. David said just to do the hysterectomy, despite Violet's insistence that he shouldn't be making the decision.\n\nAfter surgery, Joanna was stable and Addison told David she was able to control the bleeding without doing the hysterectomy. David was angry and decided that he wanted her transferred to another hospital as soon as possible.\n\nJoanna woke up from her surgery and said that David didn't want a baby, but she thought it would be a new start for them. She thought David would be excited like she was, but he wasn't. She got up to get him more food, but he punched her. Joanna said she didn't want to talk to the police. She wanted David dead.\n\nDavid was shocked to find that Joanna had left the hospital without him.\n\nJoanna went home with Violet to her house, where Violet took care of her while she started to heal. Joanna said that Violet's book made her feel like a failure because she'd gone back to David. She didn't want to go to the police because she didn't want to be treated like a victim. She believed it was her fault because she'd gone back to David. Violet expressed concern about Joanna saying she wanted David dead, but Joanna said she wasn't serious.\n\nThe next day, David showed up at Violet's house, angry and insisting that Joanna come with him. David blamed Violet for Joanna leaving him and hit her, knocking her out. When she woke up, she found Joanna stabbing a deceased David repeatedly. Violet stopped her and Joanna said she had to do it and asked if Violet would tell the police that.\n\nThe police came to the house and Joanna was arrested. Violet told [[Detective Rollins]], who came to investigate the death, that it was self-defense, despite not witnessing it personally.

By that point, Dave's son, Stevie, was with his father, who was unresponsive. Sam called an ambulance and had the paramedics take Stevie and Gloria along with Dave to the hospital, worried about leaving Gloria in charge of Stevie. In the ER, Dave was quickly discharged at his own request. Sam came to the house and requested that they not eat anything from the kitchen until it had been completely cleaned, concerned about poisoning. Later, Stevie came to the practice with the same symptoms of his father. Suspicious, Sam ran tests and found coprine in Stevie's blood, a natural antabuse from ink cap mushrooms. He deduced that Gloria had been feeding them to Dave to get him to stop drinking, because drinking made him violently ill after consuming the mushrooms. Sam spoke to Gloria privately, trying to convince her to stop, but she was unwilling to do so because she knew she didn't have much time left to live and didn't want her son to keep drinking, as she knew he would end up dead.

His symptoms had been getting worse since then. His EKG showed non-specific abnormalities, so Sam moved him to St. Ambrose for a chest CT and an echo.\n\nRaymond's tests showed pulmonary hypertension.

Raymond told Sam about how he'd watched Sam grow up and how he'd thought a lot about what would be different if they were a family. But he made the choice to stay with Jillian. He told Sam he wouldn't let Sam take a part of himself to save him. He was ready to go.

He was married to [[Heather Parker]] until her death and had one daughter, [[Betsey Parker]]. He died following injuries sustained from a car crash.\n\n\n\nDuring his childhood, Dell was abused by his mother.<ref>[[In Which Charlotte Goes Down the Rabbit Hole]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nDell became addicted to heroin and he introduced his girlfriend Heather to his drug dealing friends. When he was , Heather became pregnant with their child, Betsey. Dell wanted her to have an abortion. They even drove up to the clinic and when Heather refused to get out of the car, he yelled at her for it. However, after Betsey's birth, he was grateful Heather didn't have the abortion. The experience caused him to become anti-abortion.<ref>[[Crime and Punishment]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nDell managed to stop using, but it wasn't for a few more years that Heather managed to stop.\n\n\nDell was enrolled as a student in the South Bay School of Holistic Midwifery and Family Nursing. He earned credit towards his degree in midwifery by assisting staff doctors with obstetrical exams and childbirths. Dell's hobbies included surfing during his lunch break.\n\n\nWhen Heather got a promotion at work, she talked to Dell, informing him the promotion was in St. Louis. Dell did not want this to happen, and they fought about it. Later on, when Dell went to talk to her, he found her apartment empty, and Betsey gone. However, the job put pressure on Heather and she started using again. She returned to Los Angeles to ask Dell for $, in exchange for his daughter. While he got the money from Sam, he changed his mind when Heather came to collect it. He told her he would call the police or DCFS if necessary, but he couldn't give her money to go kill herself with drugs since Betsey loved her. Heather then left but promised she would somehow get Betsey back.\n\nLater, Dell married Heather when she went through rehab. Most of the group at the practice did not approve of this. He later yelled at Violet and Naomi due to them not approving of his marriage. This angered him and led him to say things that they had done.\n\n\nOne night when Dell was heading out for work, his home exploded. Betsey was injured, and Heather received rd degree burns on her body. Later, the explosion was revealed to have been caused by Crystal Meth being cooked on the stove by Heather. Dell was furious and told Heather to go die and suffer a miserable death due to putting their daughter in danger. After this, Dell refused to let Betsey see her mother. Later in the hospital that night, Heather died due to her injuries, without having the chance to say goodbye to Dell or Betsey.<ref>[[Blowups]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nDell announced he was accepted into the UCLA Medical School. Dell died of a brain hemorrhage and subdural hematomas sustained from a collision with an intoxicated driver while driving Maya to the hospital to deliver her baby. His bleeding was overlooked causing the damage to spread before being detected.<ref>[[The End of a Beautiful Friendship]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nDell often gets caught up in his emotions. He loves and hates wholeheartedly. As often shown, this can lead to situations he has not thought through well.\n\n\n\n[[Naomi Bennett]]\nDell had a crush on his boss, [[Naomi Bennett]]. He often showed it by getting her coffee, bringing her home-baked chocolate cake, and generally complimenting and adoring her. Naomi didn't take his crush seriously, calling him a \"kid\" although when she needed to feel better, at one o' clock, she and Violet would go to the lobby to see Dell walk down to the beach for surfing in only his swimming trunks and also an hour later, when he was wet.\n\nAfter realizing his feelings had developed into something more serious than a crush, Dell decided to fight for Naomi and when putting her jacket on her, he kissed her and told her he sure didn't have it all together, but that he was a man, not a kid. He promised he'd fight for her and left her office, only to see her kissing Sam seconds later. This made him realize Sam was fighting for ex-wife again, just like him.\n\nUnable to handle the pressures of covering for Naomi and financial problems of the practice any more and not even getting some attention from her in return, a frustrated Dell quit his job. He started working at St. Ambrose Hospital, where Naomi came to say hi after finding out. He didn't want to talk to her and just continued working. She later returned and told him she took him for granted and should've listened to him, and that she and the practice had been adrift since he left. She begged him to come back, but he told her he was happy at the hospital, as he was respected and taught there.\n\n[[Heather Parker]]\nDell married Heather and most of the group at the Practice did not approve of this. He later yelled at Violet and Naomi due to them not approving of his marriage, which angered him to say things they had done, such as Violet being so cold to Pete and their son Lucas, and Naomi leaving the practice for the other practice downstairs.\n\n\nDell was primarily raised by his grandparents. His father presumably left his mother during her pregnancy or shortly after Dell's birth, as he didn't have a part in raising Dell. Dell's mother, whom he described as a \"traveling stone\", started traveling around the world. She \"rolled right off\" and left Dell with her parents. She only sends him occasional postcards. Thereby, Dell has no close relationship with any of his parents. When his grandmother died, Dell was left on his own when his grandfather moved to a nursing home.\n\n\nDell greeted people with a happy smile when they arrived at the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. Much more than just their receptionist, Dell performed many of the day-to-day operations that kept the practice up and running. Dell received his nursing degree.\n\nDell was also a trainee midwife, frequently shadowing [[Naomi Bennett]] and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] during births at the practice.\n\nDell also briefly worked at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]] as a nurse after he left Oceanside Wellness, unable to handle the pressures of covering for Naomi and financial problems of the practice any more.\n\nDell got into medical school at [[UCLA Medical Center|UCLA]] before his death. No one knew about it except Charlotte, Violet, and Maya, whom he told her in order for her to calm down.\n\n\n*He hated wearing pink scrubs.<ref>[[Nothing to Talk About]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Dell was pro-life.<ref>[[Crime and Punishment]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He had a scar from when a patient threw a coffee cup at his head.<ref>[[In the Name of Love]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He was  when he died.\n*He was the only adult main character of either ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' or ''[[Private Practice]]'' that wasn't a doctor.\n*He was the first main character to be killed off in Private Practice.\ua\n*Dell had a personalized scrub cap, which was outer-space themed.\ua\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPDellParker.png\nPPDellParker.png\nPPDellParker.png\nPPDellParker.png\n</gallery>\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Dell-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[In Which Dell Finds His Fight]]\n*[[Serving Two Masters]]\n*[[Crime and Punishment]]\n*[[Blowups]]\n*[[The End of a Beautiful Friendship]]\n\n\n:'''Dell:''' I think Betsey's owed one.

He had been crying for  hours and wasn't able to eat or sleep. Pete and Cooper examined him and said he was small for ten days and he was malnourished and dehydrated. They questioned why she was bottle feeding instead of breastfeeding, if there was trouble latching or what. Cooper then noticed she didn't look like she'd given birth ten days prior. They figured out Eli wasn't her son.\n\nShe explained that Eli was her brother. Her mother's a drug addict who gave birth and then left him two days later to score. Her mom had been doing it to her since she was eight. She was in foster care for a while and went back and forth. She wanted better for Eli, so she was taking care of him.\n\nEli had neonatal abstinence syndrome because of his mother's drug use and a cystic adenomatoid malformation. It needed to be removed, but operating with him being so small was risky. Pete brought in [[Melissa (Too Much)|Melissa]], whom he had found. She said she'd left to score drugs, but she changed her mind and got clean instead by locking herself in a motel room for eight days. She said she'd called during those eight days, but Denise didn't answer or call or her back.\n\nMelissa went in to see Eli and Denise yelled at her, saying she wouldn't let her hurt Eli. Eli started crashing and they had to rush him into surgery.\n\nAfter his surgery, Melissa said she was trying to do the wrong thing and really wanted to have the chance to be a mother to Eli.\n\nBecause of the complicated situation, they called social services, who sent [[Gladys]]. Gladys spoke to Melissa and Denise and said that if the doctors believed Melissa having Eli was to his detriment, they could explore other options.\n\nCooper spoke to Denise, telling her that Melissa would need a lot of help taking care of Eli and said that even if it didn't seem like it, they were a family and they needed to look out for one another.\n\nDenise came to see Eli in the NICU and talked to Melissa.

Cooper decided to order an MRI and have Amelia consult. He was being raised by Dennis after his parents died in a car accident when he was five.\n\nThe MRI showed a large brain tumor in the area of Patrick's brain that controls hand function. Amelia recommended surgery, but said the safest option meant that Patrick might lose all function in his right hand, meaning he wouldn't be able to play piano. The alternative was an awake craniotomy, in order to allow her to track progress and monitor his hand function as she worked. But because it would take longer, there was a risk he'd end up with paralysis in his right leg. Patrick said he needed piano and asked Dennis to let him have the surgery because he needed piano, but didn't need his legs.\n\nHowever, Dennis said they were going to go with the safer option, though Patrick said it wasn't what he wanted. Amelia and Cooper informed them that they couldn't do what Patrick wanted without Dennis's consent and they also couldn't do what Dennis wanted without Patrick's consent. It would become a matter for the courts. They'd probably rule with Dennis, but they didn't have time to wait for that. Patrick said Dennis could either let him do the awake craniotomy or let him die.\n\nCooper went to talk to Patrick, who said that being a musician was the most important thing in the world to him. He also said that music was his entire relationship with his grandfather. After his parents' funeral, Dennis never looked at him until he started to teach him to play piano. He believed Dennis couldn't learn another way to bond with him.\n\nAmelia brought Dennis in and said that they needed to talk to each other and choose a surgery because his tumor would keep growing. Dennis said he loves Patrick, even though he doesn't say it. Amelia told him what Patrick had said about his relationship and said Dennis needed to tell Patrick he loves him. He became angry, saying she didn't understand, but after she told him about her father's death, he said to do the surgery if that's what Patrick wanted.\n\nPatrick was taken in for surgery and believed his grandfather wouldn't show up to see him before the surgery because he only loved him for his music. During the surgery, Patrick played piano in order to give Amelia an idea of which areas she could cut into and which she couldn't. He said he wished Cooper had been right about his grandfather loving him no matter what.\n\nDennis arrived at the hospital after Patrick was already in surgery. He regretted agreeing to the surgery, saying he thought if he gave Patrick what he wanted, Patrick would know how he felt. Not wanting to risk Patrick dying before he had a chance to tell him, Cooper brought Dennis into the OR to tell Patrick he loved him. At that moment, Patrick started bleeding and said he couldn't feel his hand. Cooper took Dennis back out of the OR while Amelia worked to stop the bleeding.\n\nAmelia later came out and told Dennis she'd gotten the whole tumor. They wouldn't know until he woke up if he'd have any paralysis, but she was hopeful.\n\n\n\nHis wife died of a stroke.\n\n\nHis son died in a car accident. After the accident, Dennis took over raising his grandson, Patrick.\n\n\nHe was a renowned conductor until his son died.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hoffman, Dennis}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

At the end of the day, she, George, and Meredith lay under the tree and looked up at the lights. Doc came and joined them under the tree.

Meredith denied this, saying that he's their dog and they love their dog. However, after Doc started eating her laundry, Meredith hid with the others. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\nAfter he peed on Izzie's bed, she insisted that they get rid of him. George backed her up, saying either the dog goes or he goes. When Meredith hesitated, he said he'd be moving out. Izzie made up a flyer to try to get someone else to take Doc. At the end of the day, Izzie refused to take Doc home, so Meredith took him out to [[Derek's Trailer]], where he went to live with Derek and Addison.

Derek took him home, but brought him back that evening, saying he was listless and hadn't eaten all day. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nThe tests revealed that Doc had bone cancer. Finn gave them treatment options, but Derek suggested that it might be more humane to put him down. After consulting with [[Callie Torres]], Meredith realized that Doc wasn't going to get better, a conclusion she confirmed with Finn. He said the best case scenario is that Doc has a year left, but Doc wasn't the best case scenario. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\n\nDoc's cancer spread to his brain and they made the decision to put him to sleep. Although Finn had the means of disposing him, Meredith did not want him thrown away like garbage and so Derek agreed to have him buried at the clearing by trailer, overlooking the water.

''(\"[[Triangles]]\")''\n\nAs Kayla was in a coma, Eddie decided he wanted to turn the machines off, believing Kayla wouldn't want to live like that. Vanessa, opposing the decision, went to Simon and Angie and told them about it. They believed Kayla would want them to continue life support until the babies were born. Eddie still insisted he just wanted Kayla to have peace. The McConnells got a lawyer to prevent him from turning off the machines. Only essential medical personnel were allowed in Kayla's room while they waited for a judge to rule on what would happen.\n\nEddie waited outside Kayla's room in the hallway. He called some lawyers, but couldn't afford any of them. [[Charlotte King]] gave him the name of a lawyer at a non-profit aid group and encouraged him to call.\n\nThe judge came in and ruled that Kayla's life would have to continue until viability had been reached. She also ordered that her room continued to be closed to all but essential medical personnel.\n\nCharlotte later saw Eddie waiting outside Kayla's room, so she left the door unlocked and told him the nurse was on break. He went into her room and locked the door. He then disconnected her ventilator. They broke a window to get into the room, but before they could reconnect the ventilator, they saw that Kayla was breathing on her own. ''(\"[[Pulling the Plug]]\")''\n\nAfter six weeks in a coma, Eddie called in [[Geraldine Ginsberg]] to try to wake Kayla up. After she ran tests and examined Kayla, Ginsberg believed nothing could be done. However, [[Amelia Shepherd]], who was on Ginsberg's team, had an idea. Ginsberg believed it wouldn't work, so she refused to do it. When Ginsberg fired Amelia, she stayed to help Kayla. After speaking with Eddie, Amelia agreed to do the surgery.\n\nAfter hearing about what Amelia had planned, the McConnells asked her not to operate, to give them a little more time so the babies could mature more. Despite this, she operated. During the surgery, the three babies had to be delivered, but Amelia was then able to finish the procedure.\n\nAfter surgery, Kayla's reflexes started to re-emerge and she woke up.

The baby was fine, but Addison believed the pregnancy was exasperating her condition. Pete believed she had fibromyalgia.

She said she'd rather get AIDS than die. Because of the anti-rejection drugs she'd have to take for the kidney, the doctors believed she had the potential to develop full-blown AIDS quickly.\n\nWhen Sarah's organs started shutting down, Bailey appealed to Charlotte to do the transplant with Emily's kidney.

The hospital's lawyers said she needed to release the information to them. It was Duncan and Melinda, whom Naomi had helped conceive.\n\nShe called the Stinsons in and explained the situation to them. They and the O'Briens were told that according to California law, if the blood tests showed that their suspicions were correct, Emily would go live with the Stinsons and Sarah with the O'Briens. The tests confirmed that Emily was the Stinsons' and Sarah was the O'Briens'. Duncan Stinson was angry, saying he wanted his money back, after learning that the other baby in the switch, their baby, was sick. Melinda went to see Violet, saying she could take Sarah and run, but Violet said she wouldn't because Emily was her baby.\n\nAfter reviewing the visitations records at the hospital, the doctors figured out that Duncan had switched the babies intentionally after Emily had a seizure when she was two days old. Duncan confessed that they'd done it because he wanted a healthy child. Melinda was shocked that he'd given her baby away.\n\nThey set up a trade and Melinda gave Sarah to the O'Briens and took Emily with her.

She thought about calling him but she was too scared since she thought it could've been possible Cooper wasn't the father and then they'd been stuck in each other's lives.\n\n\nOne day, Erica approached Cooper at Seaside Health and Wellness, the practice where he works. He initially didn't recognize her. Erica reminded him who she was and showed him Mason, their son. ''(\"[[Deal With It]]\")''\n\nHe was shocked and asked if she was sure. When she said she was, Cooper asked why she had come now. Erica said Mason had been asking about him and he was too old to be distracted. She suggested he give Mason a checkup as a start. He impressed Mason with a magic trick. They later hung out at the pier, but Erica told Cooper she wasn't ready for Mason to know that Cooper was his father.\n\n\nCharlotte, unconvinced that Erica was telling the truth, met up with her and wrote her a check, telling her to come to her again if she needed more money, but to stay away from Cooper. Erica was supposed to bring Mason to see Cooper that night, but she didn't show up. She came in the next day, giving Cooper the check back and saying she wasn't a whore. Cooper told her that he didn't do it and said he'd make it right. A paternity test confirmed that Cooper was Mason's biological father. ''(\"[[Remember Me]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the incident with Charlotte, Erica decided to set ground rules for the time they spent together. She said Charlotte wasn't allowed around Mason and she didn't want Cooper to tell Mason he was his father. In order to get to see him, those were her conditions. The three of them went fishing together and Mason asked Cooper if he was dating Erica. Cooper said he wasn't.\n\nMason decided he didn't want to keep seeing Cooper. When Cooper talked to him later, Mason asked if Cooper was his dad. Mason said they couldn't be friends if he was not going to be around, like the other guys. They told Mason Cooper was his dad and Cooper said he wasn't going anywhere. ''(\"[[Step One]]\")''\n\nAs Mason and Cooper bonded, Erica maintained that she didn't want Mason to be around Charlotte. When she came to pick Mason up at the end of the day and found Charlotte there, she was upset and left abruptly. She later came to see Cooper and said that she had realized that Charlotte wasn't a bad person. ''(\"[[Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough]]\")''\n\n\nMason had a part in James and the Giant Peach at his school. Cooper helped him rehearse and promised to go see the show. Erica was working backstage with the kids on costumes. When Cooper had to miss the play to take care of a patient, she told him he covered well, but he didn't believe her. ''(\"[[The Breaking Point]]\")''\n\n\nShe and Mason went to Thanksgiving dinner at Addison's house along with the other doctors in the practice. ''(\"[[The Breaking Point]]\")''\n\n\nErica visited Cooper and Mason, who were drinking milkshakes in the practice's kitchen. Amelia, who was also in the kitchen, noticed Erica's hand shaking. Erica picked up a milkshake glass and suddenly dropped it due to the weakness in her hand.\n\nThis made Amelia suspicious. She stitched up Erica's cut finger and offered to give Erica a neuro work up, but she refused. Amelia told Charlotte about her suspicions, so Charlotte called a clinic Erica had been to recently and had them courier over her most recent brain scan, which revealed that she had a massive gliosarcoma.\n\nWhen confronted by Charlotte, Erica admitted that she had gone to numerous surgeons, all of whom had determined the tumor to be inoperable. Erica didn't want to tell Cooper, but after Charlotte pressured her, she did. ''(\"[[The Standing Eight Count]]\")''\n\nCooper had papers drawn up to ensure that if Erica died, Mason would go to Cooper. Erica was reluctant to sign it. Cooper figured out she hadn't reached acceptance, which meant she still had hope. He told her not to waste it. She agreed to see Amelia to look into options. Amelia did new tests and said that the best they could do was aggressive radiation therapy and chemotherapy to slow the growth. It could give her about six months and it would be rough. She decided she didn't want to try it, but Cooper said that without it, she'd miss Mason's next birthday. It's not much time, but another birthday with his mom would mean a lot to Mason. Erica went to Amelia and asked if she'd do chemotherapy and radiation if she were in Erica's shoes. Amelia admitted that she wouldn't do the treatment. Erica took the paperwork back to Cooper and said they'd sign it tomorrow. Cooper was upset that she was giving up. ''(\"[[Losing Battles]]\")''\n\n\nSoon after that, Erica and Mason were brought to the ER after being in a car accident. She was disoriented after the accident and Mason said she'd fallen asleep at the wheel. Amelia ran tests and determined that the likely cause of the accident was a seizure caused by the tumor. She warned that Erica only had a few months to live and her symptoms would get worse during that time. When Mason came to visit her later, she had a tonic clonic seizure in front of him. Cooper later went to Erica and asked her to fight. ''(\"[[The Time Has Come]]\")''\n\n\nErica started chemotherapy and refused to let Mason come in to see her during her treatments. Amelia did research into gliosarcomas during this time, trying to figure out another option for Erica. She found an experimental treatment in New Zealand, but Erica said she wouldn't go because it would mean leaving Mason. Amelia did more research and suggested instead that they go to Seattle, where Derek would help her. ''(\"[[Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Amelia and Derek practiced the procedure and felt confident they could do it, Erica came to Seattle to have surgery the next morning. She wanted to spend one more day with Mason first. As they played football in the park, Erica started to cry and she finally told Mason she was sick and needed to have surgery.\n\nThe next day, they successfully cut off and restored blood flow within the required  seconds, but Erica threw a clot and had a stroke. Despite that, they were able to remove her whole tumor and finish her surgery. She woke up after surgery in pain, but able to move her fingers and toes. ''(\"[[You Break My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Erica was weak and recovering from her surgery, Cooper tried to be there with her and Mason every night, but it started affecting his ability to do his job, so Charlotte hired a night nurse to stay overnight and take care of Erica. ''(\"[[Andromeda]]\")''\n\n\nNot long after the surgery, Erica was in severe abdominal pain and began to vomit blood. She was rushed to the ER where it was determined that the gliosarcoma had spread to her liver, GI tract, and near her spine. She was told she had about a week to live, during which she'd develop paralysis and be in serious pain. She didn't want Mason to be there to watch that happen, so they brought him in to say goodbye for the last time. Charlotte went to see her afterward to see if there was anyone she wanted Charlotte to call. When Erica said she didn't have anyone, Charlotte held her hand and told her that wasn't true. ''(\"[[The Letting Go]]\")''\n\nErica's condition continued to decline with Charlotte by her side. She continued to refuse to see Mason. When the time came that she had only minutes to live, Erica relented and Charlotte rushed to bring Mason to Erica's bedside. Mason arrived in time and climbed into Erica's bed and hugged her until she died. ''(\"[[It Was Inevitable]]\")''\n\n\n\nMason mentioned that Erica had had some boyfriends, but they all left her at some point.\n\n\n[[Mason Warner]]\nErica was a loving mother to Mason. She wanted to protect Mason from everything, even keeping her tumor a secret from him. When he found out that she was sick, he was very upset. However, he forgave her when she was on her deathbed.\n\nShe originally didn't want Mason to see her dying because she cared so much about him. Charlotte convinced her that Mason would never get closure if he didn't see his mother one last time, so Erica allowed him to come into her hospital room. She died as he held her in a hug.\n\n[[Cooper Freedman]]\nErica and Cooper had a one-night stand in her car. The result of this night was Erica getting pregnant with their son, [[Mason Warner|Mason]]. Years later, Erica searched for Cooper so he could start to be Mason's father, as she had been diagnosed with an inoperable gliosarcoma.\n\n\n[[Charlotte King]]\nWhen Charlotte was suspicious that Erica was lying about Cooper being Mason's father, she was very mean to Erica. She even sent her a check for Erica to go away and never talk to Cooper again.\n\n\nShe was a bartender when she and Cooper first met.\n\n\n*She once spat on a six year old for spitting on then three year old Mason.<ref>[[Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough]], x (PP)</ref>\n*She liked to party before she had Mason.<ref>[[Remember Me]], x (PP)</ref>\n*She talks like Yoda when she is stressed.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[Deal With It]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[Remember Me]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[Step One]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[If I Hadn't Forgotten...]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[The Breaking Point]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[The Standing Eight Count]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[Losing Battles]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[The Time Has Come]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[Too Much]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[You Break My Heart]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[Andromeda]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[The Letting Go]]\nPPxEricaWarner.png|[[It Was Inevitable]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Erica Warner Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Erica Warner]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Warner, Erica}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He did an ultrasound, which revealed that she was pregnant.\n\nHer mother was worried she would be unable to carry a pregnancy safely because of her heart problems, but Sam said it would be high-risk, but not impossible. Erin then asked about how Tanya and Ricky would manage raising a child, especially if the baby also had special needs. The baby had a % chance of having Down syndrome. Erin said she loved Tanya, but she didn't know if she could raise another child with Down syndrome. She felt aborting the baby was the only option she had. Naomi suggested CVS before doing that, so she'd know if the baby was healthy or had Down syndrome. Erin agreed to let her run the test.\n\nThey did the CVS and Ricky came into the room just after they finished. Erin then decided to tell Ricky and Tanya about the pregnancy.

Rose and Kendra said they'd been together for six years and they were ready to have a baby. Evan was there to be the sperm donor. They wanted to use Rose's egg, but have Kendra carry so they could both be part of the experience. Jake consulted with them and then insisted that they sit down with Violet before proceeding because they were using a known donor, so that everyone would know what the expectations and limitations were.\n\nThey sat down with Violet, who asked Evan what he saw his role as. He said he'd donate the sperm, put together the crib, and then be the cool uncle. Violet questioned what would happen when the baby got a little older and he disagreed with a parenting decision. Her insistence on the truth pressed the three of them to admit that they were a polyamorous triad and planned to raise the baby together. Violet reminded them that they'd have to raise the child in the real world, which wouldn't be as accepting of their family as they were. They believed that they had enough love that they could it through.\n\nRose and Kendra went in to be examined before starting the process. Kendra's exam was unremarkable, but Rose was informed that she had uterine scarring and ovarian failure secondary to pelvic tuberculosis, making her completely infertile. However, Jake said that Kendra and Evan would not likely have trouble conceiving without assistance if they want. Rose quickly backed out of the pursuit for a baby, saying that they couldn't do it if they couldn't all be part of it.\n\nKendra and Evan saw Violet without Rose, saying they didn't understand the problem. Violet explained Rose's point of view on them sharing something she wasn't part of. They wanted to fix it, so Violet suggested a compromise.\n\nRose went to Jake asking if there was anything he could do to make her able to participate. He said that many women come to him unable to conceive and he still finds a way to make them mothers. She was worried a baby would change everything. He said that if the love were real, it could withstand anything, but admitted he didn't actually believe that. Love's powerful, but sometimes life wins.\n\nRose went to Kendra and Evan and said she wanted a baby, but not that way. Despite that, she said she loved them and agreed to trust them and have them conceive together. Evan agreed, but Kendra said she couldn't do it. She said the reason they worked was because of the rules. They needed unanimous to avoid someone getting hurt. She said they could have a baby another way, but given the choice, she chose the three of them. Evan said it wasn't trivial. He wanted a biological child and wasn't sure he could choose the relationship above that.\n\n\n\nHe's been seeing Kendra and Rose for six years. They said the first night was amazing and so was the next morning and the morning after that. To make the relationship work, they had very strict rules to follow, including one that stated all decisions had to be unanimous so no one felt ganged up on. Rose's infertility threatened their relationship, leaving their future together in question.\n\n\nEvan says he grew up in a family with a lot of commitment, but not a lot of love.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Olsen, Evan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (REI)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

They took a picture of her rash and sent it to Dell to try to identify it. In the meantime, they decided to send Helen out to the hospital. However, before she could be taken, the illness quickly spread and they decided to lock down the place while waiting for St. Ambrose to prepare an isolation unit for them. The infectious disease specialist came back with a diagnosis of typhus. They started antibiotics for all the nuns and started asking if anyone had broken sequester, because the incubation period for typhus is two weeks. No one would admit to anything, but Sam and Naomi watched Mark give the sacrament of the sick and began to suspect that there was more to their relationship than he had said.

While looking over Frances's notes in the ER, Naomi noticed Frances wasn't given a [[Computed Tomography|CT]] scan prior to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, Henry stating that her doctor said she didn't require any more tests. Back at the practice, Naomi did some research and diagnosed her with normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Sam pointed out Frances was not a candidate for neurosurgery, but Naomi pulled up another study claiming that a spinal tap to drain away excess cerebrospinal fluid could give Frances a few moments of lucidity, and Naomi wanted that so she could see how bad things were for Henry.\n\n[[Sam Bennett|Sam]] performed the spinal tap at [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose]], and while waiting for Frances to wake up, Henry recalled their last moments together the last time she was lucid: Frances was shivering, and Henry asked if she wanted him to turn the heat up and he did, and when he returned, she didn't know who he was. Following this, Frances woke up lucid. Naomi quickly explained the situation, and had him promise her that he would visit her every day and hold her hand, and then let her go.\n\n\n\nFrances has a husband, Henry.

They had conceived the baby with their last embryo and Isabelle didn't have any eggs left, so they wanted to harvest their baby's eggs to use to become parents.\n\nIsabelle and Frank came into the practice to try to convince Addison to do the surgery. She said they had other options to be parents, such as adoption, but Isabelle said she needed to be a parent to a baby she carried herself. Addison agreed to do the surgery, but only after the baby was born, so she wouldn't have to cut into Isabelle's uterus.\n\nWhen Isabelle went into labor, Addison went to the hospital to deliver the baby.

Cooper asked him about keeping it clean, but he said they were sleeping in the car, which made it difficult to keep the area clean.\n\nCooper gave him a prescription for antibiotics, but also told his father he'd need a new insulin pump. Cooper said that that would take a few days, but Frank said that he needed to get to Oregon in order to keep a job he'd gotten. Cooper talked to him and said that he needed to wait for his kid's well being. Cooper ran the serial number on Porter's pump and found that it was registered to Evan Dawson. When Cooper called the doctor who placed it, he found out that Evan had been kidnapped. Cooper called Frank and Porter back to the practice, saying he needed to run a few more tests. Once alone with Porter, Cooper asked him about it. Evan then confessed that he and his father had run away because his mom's boyfriend, who was living with her, had started to hit him and his father was the only person who believed him. Evan then had a seizure due to low blood sugar. He was rushed to the hospital and a new pump was placed. However, the hospital also ran the number on his old pump and found that he had been kidnapped and called the police. However, Cooper gave them a heads up and sent them out of the hospital with some supplies to keep them going for a while.

However, he met up with Evan and his father in the park and examined him and drew some blood for tests. Cooper told Frank about Lynn coming to see him, but said they didn't need to run, but to be careful.\n\nCooper was arrested for helping them and the detective showed Cooper a call log that showed that Lynn received a call from Evan asking her to stop looking for him so his dad and Cooper didn't get in trouble. Since he was in jail, Cooper sent Charlotte to get Evan's labs and give him antibiotics for his kidney infection.\n\nAt a grand jury hearing, Cooper refused to answer questions about where Evan and Frank were. A judge offered him immunity in exchange for telling where they were. When he again refused, he was held in contempt without bail.\n\nCharlotte picked up Evan's labs and took antibiotics to him. However, the police found them, tipped off by Addison, and arrested Frank and returned Evan to his mother. Evan later came into the ER saying that Ted had stabbed him, but Charlotte and Sam observed that he had intention marks meaning he'd do it himself. He said that he thought it would force them to release his father from jail. Charlotte said they needed to find real evidence to put Ted in jail. Evan then admitted that he'd made it up to try to keep his parents together, but his mother didn't believe him and his father did.

His first case at [[Pacific Wellcare Center]] was with Naomi. [[Sally Donovan|Sally]] and [[Curtis Donovan]] were both dwarfs. They wanted a dwarf baby and wanted to use selective IVF to get one. Naomi was reluctant, but agreed, until she found that the dwarf embryos also had a mutation that had a % chance of causing cancer. He said the Donovans had agreed to go ahead anyway. Naomi talked to the Donovans and said that she would not implant the mutated embryos. Gabriel then told her that medicine would go the way toward genetic engineering whether she was okay with it or not. ''(\"[[Slip Slidin' Away]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Gabriel heard that Pete was trying to keep [[Neil Delhom]] alive for six more weeks so that he could meet his unborn daughter, Gabriel suggested a device that would target the tumor.

When the infection took over his body, Gabriel finally admitted they'd need to remove the bolt and possibly what was left of Colin's arm. Pete instead suggested antibiotic implants, which would fight the infection and give him a chance to keep what was left of his arm.

She was then shocked when Gabriel informed her that William had gone to Switzerland without telling her. After a second conversation about Naomi's unhappiness in her life, they kissed again. Naomi then talked to Charlotte about options for sex because of Gabriel's limited mobility. Gabriel found the guide Charlotte had given her on Naomi's desk. He asked why she didn't just ask him. He clarified that he can have sex and said if she wanted, they could go back to his place with a bottle of wine and see what happened.

She'd been able to visit with her boyfriend's parents for the first time since the accident, the final step on her goal list. Holly said it was great and hugged Violet.\n\nHolly later came to Violet's office to tell her that she'd gotten into Le Cordon Bleu. She didn't believe she could go, but Violet said she could handle it. Holly started to panic, saying it was too far away from Violet, who had said she'd always be there for her. She said she wasn't going and she wasn't leaving therapy because she wasn't ready. Violet agreed to keep seeing Holly.\n\nAt a later session, Holly was talking about a recipe when Violet said that it would be their last session and the receptionist wouldn't let her make another if she called. She was ready to be done because she was sitting there talking about food instead of feelings. Holly asked how she should know she was done, but Violet said she just needed to trust her. Violet said that she got into Le Cordon Bleu because she'd applied. She wanted to go and Violet worried that her ability to keep coming back to therapy was holding her back. Holly admitted she was scared, but Violet said that was normal.\n\nAs Holly prepared to get in the cab to the airport, Violet reminded her she could do it and told her to have a wonderful time. Holly thanked her for what she'd done and Violet said she'd be just fine.\n\n\n\nHer boyfriend died in a car accident, along with her parents.

Addison started to do it, but Kara said it was too painful. Jake gave her a pep talk and said she could do it. Addison was able to change the baby's position successfully. She then coached Kara through difficult delivery.\n\nThe baby didn't breathe right away, but Addison was able to stimulate and she started crying. After the birth, Jake stopped responding to them. Addison attempted again to get out of the car, but wasn't able to. However, they heard helicopters coming to find them. They put Jake in a sling and took him to the hospital. They gave the baby oxygen and got her out of there. Then they worked on prying the door open to get Kara and Addison out. However, as soon as they did, Kara started bleeding severely from her arm and she crashed. They tried everything they could, but Kara was dead in the car.\n\nAt the hospital, Addison brought the baby to Jake and Sam told him that Kara had died.\n\n\n\nHe was married to [[Kara (The Hard Part)|Kara]] until her death.\n\n\n*He wanted a home birth, which Kara said he could have if the baby came out of him.\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Jake}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Like his wife, Jake also has a double-specialty, practicing [[General Surgery|general surgery]].\n\n\n\nJake grew up with three younger sisters. Their dad left when he was  years old and their mother died when he was . College had to wait, as he didn't want to split up his family. He worked three jobs and eventually got a free ride to college, and afterwards put himself through med school. There have been many women in his life, but his first real love was Lily.\n\n\nBefore coming to Los Angeles, Jake was married to [[Lily Reilly]], a drug addict, who had a  year old daughter, [[Angela Reilly|Angela]]. After he met her, he soon adopted her daughter. One evening, Lily's drug dealer came to their home. Jake couldn't get rid of him, so he severely beat up the dealer. As a result, the police stepped in and Jake was arrested. His prints were taken and put into the system.\n\nJake frequently spent long hours at his office in order to unconsciously avoid Lily's drug addiction. Working was his way of escaping.\n\nLily died of an overdose and Jake was left alone to take care of Angela, whom he considers to be his own daughter.\n\n\nHe and Addison first met in the supermarket and flirted over pineapples. When they met again, they agreed to go on a date, but decided not to tell each other about who they were in order to make it more exciting. They kissed and flirted and he asked her to come to Fiji with him as a very long date, but standing in the airport after saying goodbye to Naomi, she decided not to go. However, Jake himself didn't go either because of a medical emergency.\n\nSoon after, they found out about their identities when he ended up being her fertility doctor.\n\n\nJake joined the practice to fill the hole left by Naomi. Initially, he felt like an outsider of the practice family. He was happy with that, as he found them to be sharing way too much with each other, but he gradually became part of the family as well.\n\n\n\nAddison proposed to Jake but he didn't say yes. She was embarrassed and hid out in the bathroom. Jake later talked to a hallucination of his dead wife [[Lily Reilly]], who understood he was old school and thought he was the one who had to propose. Lily convinced him that Jake could move on from her as their vows were till death. Jake then set up a romantic scene at Addison's house and asked her to propose again. She did and he accepted.<ref>[[The World According to Jake]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, he took interest in model trains.<ref>[[With a Little Help From My Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\nJake is a doctor who is incredibly devoted to his patients. He's willing to spend his personal time with patients if that's what they require. He also tries not to judge about what his patients ask for, as he just considers it his job to make it happen if he can.\n\nHe describes himself as patient and understanding. There is however, a limit to his patience, as demonstrated when Addison wouldn't open up to him about [[Mark Sloan]]. \n\n\n\n[[Lily Reilly]]\nAt some point in his life, Jake met Lily Reilly. They married and he adopted her  year old daughter. However, Lily was a drug addict. Even so, Jake loved her and always hoped that she would choose him over drugs. He once found her on the floor of the bathroom, where she had overdosed on drugs. He performed CPR on her until the paramedics arrived. She died of an overdose.\n\nBefore Jake married Addison, he occasionally talked to Lily, who had already died, asking for advice about Angela. Eventually, her spirit left him, saying he no longer needed her because Addison loves him and makes him happy.<ref>[[The World According to Jake]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nWhen Addison's therapist told her to make a change in her life, she met Jake and they flirted over pineapples at the grocery store. They started seeing each other at a coffee shop. However, they both agreed to keep their identities in secret. Jake was going on vacation to Fiji and he asked Addison to come with him. She eventually accepted, but when at the airport, she realized it wasn't right to try to avoid Sam and the problems the practice was suffering.\n\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb|left|Jake and Addison at their wedding.]]\nLater on, Addison started her fertility treatment only to find out that her doctor was Jake. He admitted he never left for Fiji. Flustered and embarrassed, she left his office.\n\nAddison was extremely startled when she saw that Jake had applied for the fertility specialist opening at Oceanside Wellness. She insisted that there was something wrong with him as a doctor, but he was the perfect candidate, so he was hired.\n\nLater, Addison decided to start fertility treatments again, and Jake was her doctor. He conducted two rounds of IVF on her. When both rounds failed, he helped her attempt to find a suitable surrogate.\n\nAfter Addison broke up with Sam for good, Jake told Addison that she wasn't ready for what he had to offer. He could love her, marry her, and make a baby with her, but she had to get ready. He couldn't have her pining after another man. Addison replied she could get ready.\n\nAfter Addison adopted Henry, Jake moved in with her to be Henry's loving father. A few weeks after, Addison proposed that they get married, startling him and prompting her to lock herself in the bathroom. He insisted he never said no. A few weeks later, Mildred interviewed Jake (a standard procedure when adopting a child) where she found out about Jake's criminal history. Addison wasn't upset about this because she said that her, Jake, and Henry were all supposed to be together, and the judge would see that.\n\nWhen Addison proposed to him one evening, he was stunned. He replied that marriage was a big step, and he wanted the two of them to be ready. Addison was humiliated, and locked herself in the bathroom. Their relationship was tested when Addison accused him of spending too much time with his patients. He shot back that everything was always about her. Fortunately, they got through it after Addison defended Jake to one of his former patients, [[Megan Stewart]].\n\nJake proposed to Addison and they married after Henry's adoption was finalized. He stated to Addison that he knew she was \"the one\" when he invited her to Fiji and again when he saw her sitting on his exam table for the first time.\n\n\nJake grew up as the oldest of four. He has three younger sisters. Their dad left when Jake was  years old, and their mother died when he was .\n\n[[Henry Montgomery]]\nJake is Henry's father. When Jake and Addison were dating, he acted like a father figure to Henry and had to meet [[Mildred Clemons]], the social worker, after he moved in with Addison to make sure he was a good figure in Henry's life. Addison, Jake, and Henry are all now a family.\n\n\nDr. Reilly graduated from [[Duke University School of Medicine]] and completed [[Resident|residencies]] in [[General Surgery|surgery]] and [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]], as well as completing a [[Fellow|fellowship]] in [[Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility|reproductive endocrinology and infertility]]. He is also [[Board Certification|double-board certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|general surgery]] and [[Board Certification#Obstetrics and Gynecology|obstetrics and gynecology]]. He started to work at [[Seaside Health and Wellness]] after [[Naomi Bennett]] left the practice.\n\nBefore med school, Jake worked three jobs to pay for college: he was a bike courier, a short-order cook, and a bellman. At some point, he even sold his sperm.\n\n\n*He and Addison met while flirting over pineapples, which he hates.<ref>[[...To Change the Things I Can]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Before choosing fertility, he played around with idea of specializing in drug addictions.<ref>[[Who We Are]], x (PP)</ref>\n*When Jake is formally introduced, his lab coat shows, \"Jake Reilly, M.D., [[Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|F.A.C.O.G.]]\" with \"[[Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility|Reproductive Endocrinology]]\" on the second line, embroidered in script font.\n*He and Sam played intramural basketball in college.\n*Jake is the best fertility doctor in the country, second only to [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]].\n*At some point in his life, Jake sold sperm in order to get money to take care of his family and to go to college. Therefore, it's likely that he has biological children he doesn't know about.\n*During his interview at [[Seaside Health and Wellness]], [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] specifically mentions he is [[Board Certification|board certified]] in [[General Surgery|general surgery]] and [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]]; despite having completed a [[Fellow|fellowship]] in [[Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility|REI]], subsequent episodes and promotional material for [[Private Practice]] has not stated him being board certified in REI: this cannot be assumed as there is an insufficient evidence by the show to support a board certification in REI.\n*He is a fan of Game of Thrones as he and his [[Henry Montgomery|son]] binged and subsequently argued over the show, much to the annoyance of his [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|wife]]. <ref>[[With a Little Help From My Friends]], x (GA)</ref>\n*During the Covid- Pandemic, He took up model railroading as a hobby.\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPxJakeReilly.png\nPPxJakeReilly.png\nPPxJakeReilly.png\nPPxJakeReilly.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Jake-centric or otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Remember Me]]\n*[[Drifting Back]]\n*[[The World According to Jake]]\n*[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\n\n\n:'''Jake:''' You're not ready for what I have to offer.\n:'''[[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]]:''' I can get ready.\n:'''Jake:''' That would be nice.\n\n\n{{Jake Reilly Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Jake Reilly]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reilly, Jake}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He butted heads with several of the other doctors. Amelia Shepherd disagreed with him on the case of [[Todd Reiter]], whom she believed was fine and whom he believed to have a problem. He was ultimately proven right. He disagreed with Cooper on the case of [[Sarah Nelson]], believing DCFS needed to be involved. He then told Sheldon that there was no help for his patient, [[Nick Calhoun]], who was a pedophile. ''(\"[[You Don't Know What You've Got Till It's Gone]]\")''\n\n\nJames was part of the search for [[Sarah Nelson]] after she disappeared from the ER. ''(\"[[The Next Episode]]\")''\n\nJames later told Sheldon a contract worker on the janitorial staff had been arrested in connection with Sarah's disappearance. He was a registered sex offender. ''(\"[[I'm Fine]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Charlotte went into labor at  weeks, she was rushed to the ER, where James started working to stop her labor. However, one of the babies was already presenting, so they had to deliver. After the first delivery, Jake determined the rest of the membranes were intact and her labor stopped. ''(\"[[Life Support]]\")''\n\nWhile Charlotte was on bed rest, James came to visit her and they watched sports together. ''(\"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\")''\n\n\nJames attended Jake and Addison's wedding with Amelia. ''(\"[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nWhen he and Amelia attended Naomi and Sam's second wedding, he told her that would be them one day. ''(\"[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nJames met Amelia during his first night at St. Ambrose. She disagreed with him about [[Todd Reiter]] and told him to send Todd home. When he found an infection that could have paralyzed Todd, he passed the credit to Amelia. When his shift ended, he found Amelia and asked if he could buy her a drink. However, she declined, telling him she doesn't drink. She then told him she'd given birth to an anencephalic baby and if she started drinking, she'd never stop. ''(\"[[You Don't Know What You've Got Till It's Gone]]\")''\n\nAt a barbecue at Sam's house, James approached Amelia again and she turned him down again. ''(\"[[The Next Episode]]\")''\n\nAmelia continued to brush off his attempts to bond with her. He told her he eats at Billy's every Friday and suggested she might join him, because they have really, really good fries there. After Jake told her James was a good guy, Amelia showed up to eat with him. ''(\"[[The World According to Jake]]\")''\n\nWhen Amelia decided to start dating again, she went on several bad blind dates before going to Billy's on Friday night to see James. At the end of the night, he hugged her instead of kissing her, to her surprise.\n\nJames asked her out again and they went to dinner. At the end of the night, he still didn't kiss her. He later showed up at her place and kissed her, saying the anticipation was killing him.\n\nThey later tried to have sex, but she started having flashbacks to Ryan, so she pulled back and left the room. The next morning, she found him still in her apartment, making breakfast. He said she didn't owe him an explanation, but she explained anyway and gave him an out, which he didn't take. They went to bed and had sex. Afterward, she told him about Ryan and her drug use and alcoholism. He then invited her to meet his parents, who were coming into town.\n\nDuring the dinner, James's mother, Stella, started questioning Amelia. James stepped in and moved the conversation to another topic. Amelia later yelled at James for not letting her stand up for herself and for silencing her during the conversation. She said it wasn't working and asked him to leave. When he refused, she left.\n\nWhen he saw her later, he asked her what the fight was really about. She told him that all the men she loves die. He told her he loved her. After saving their shared patient, she told him she loved him too. ''(\"[[Good Fries Are Hard to Come By]]\")''\n\nAfter seeing Charlotte give birth, Amelia told James she wanted babies, but she was scared to want them because of what happened to her baby. She then said that if they got that far, she wanted to have babies with him. ''(\"[[Full Release]]\")''\n\nAt Naomi and Sam's wedding, James told Amelia that would be them one day. ''(\"[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\")''\n\nHowever, she freaked out when he proposed to her and went to visit her brother in Seattle, seeing if she could handle a married life with kids. She concluded she couldn't and realized that she loved Seattle. She had several calls with James and broke off the engagement.\n\n\nHis grandmother had cancer. While she was dying, he was busy with medical school, so he didn't spend that much time by her side. He confessed to Addison that he regrets not having made more time for her.

''(\"[[Good Fries Are Hard to Come By]]\")''\n\n\n[[Vivian Carlsmith]]\nWhen Vivian was in the hospital dying, James regularly visited her, playing cards and talking.

[[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] attempted to do an exam, but was unable to get the speculum into Kathleen's vagina. She prescribed muscle relaxants to treat vaginismus, involuntary spasms in the vagina. Kathleen went home, but was still unable to have sex with her husband, so she returned the next day.

''(\"[[In Which Addison Finds the Magic]]\")''\n\n\nTwo months later, Jeffrey and Kathleen came back into the practice. They hadn't been able to conceive and since Kathleen was older, they knew they didn't have much time left and wanted help. Addison agreed to run tests on both of them. The tests showed that Kathleen was ovulating. She also had some fibroids, but they decided just to keep an eye on them. The trouble conceiving came from Jeffrey, who was functionally sterile. They decided they'd use a sperm donor to get Kathleen pregnant. Jeffrey privately told Addison that he wanted to give Kathleen what he had. She was adopted and he wanted her to have a family member that looked like her. Kathleen struggled to pick a donor that she liked, so Jeffrey proposed a solution. He brought in his brother, Mark, to donate his sperm. Mark gave his sample and it was good, but when they went to inseminate, both Jeffrey and Kathleen stopped it last minute. Kathleen said his brother was kind of a jerk and she didn't want to have anyone's baby but his. Jeffrey begged them to find another solution so they could have a baby. They looked into the options and found a way, which involved extracting sperm directly from Jeffrey's testicles. They said it could work with only one viable sperm. They did the procedure and were able to find a single viable sperm. They extracted Kathleen's egg, inseminated it, and the implanted it back in her uterus. They were then told to go home and relax while they waited for it to implant. ''(\"[[In Which Dell Finds His Fight]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Kathleen]].

His EKG showed non-specific abnormalities, so Sam moved him to St. Ambrose for a chest CT and an echo.\n\nRaymond's tests showed pulmonary hypertension. Sam started him on anti-coagulants and placed an umbrella, which he hoped would solve the problem. When Jillian and Sam left Raymond's hospital room, the camera crew caught Dee and Raymond kissing in his room. Sam walked back in time to see it as well.\n\nDee, Raymond, and Jillian all attended a barbecue at Sam's house. Raymond pulled Sam aside and said it wasn't a fling and he really loved Dee. Sam told him to get away from him. Raymond collapsed at the party and had to be rushed to the ER.

Sam suggested they start testing family members, but Raymond and Jillian said they didn't have any children or nieces and nephews. Dee wanted to pray, but Jillian instead suggested that Sam get tested revealing that Raymond is his biological father. Jillian told Raymond she'd known all along, but hadn't said anything.\n\nDee talked to Sam about how their relationship played out. Sam decided to get tested to see if he was a match for Raymond. The test revealed that he was a match and he told Raymond he'd donate if Raymond wanted it. Raymond told Sam about how he'd watched Sam grow up and how he'd thought a lot about what would be different if they were a family. But he made the choice to stay with Jillian. He told Sam he wouldn't let Sam take a part of himself to save him. He was ready to go.\n\nJillian thanked Sam for what he'd done and apologized for telling Sam Raymond was his father.

She said that it changed something in David. She'd come to LA to get away, but David followed and was apologetic about what he'd said and done. Violet asked what he'd done and Joanna confessed that David had hit her.\n\nShe said that his hours had been cut at work while hers were getting worse, so he was always home and stewing. She also said it was partially her fault. She cancelled a run with him last minute. She texted her assistant about missing the conference call she was supposed to be on and he hit her. She hadn't told anyone what happened, even her mother, whom she was visiting.\n\nWhen David returned, Violet sent Joanna to the bathroom, saying she'd meet her there. In the bathroom, they talked more about the abuse, but Joanna insisted that she was just making a reasonable sacrifice and Violet didn't know anything about her marriage.\n\nAs they prepared to board their flight, Violet implored Joanna not to get on the plane. She said that if she couldn't talk to her mother or friends, she could talk to Violet. She slipped Joanna her card as David tried to rush her onto the plane.\n\nViolet later got a call from Joanna, who hadn't gotten on the plane.

He'd done therapy and anger management and they were doing so much better. He insisted that he wasn't the one who had beaten her.\n\nAfter her exam, Addison told David Joanna was bleeding into her abdomen and she wasn't able to detect a fetal heartbeat. She'd lost the pregnancy because of the trauma. Addison also said there was a tear in Joanna's uterus and she might have to do a hysterectomy to stabilize her. David told her to do it. Addison said she might be able to do it without the hysterectomy, but it was riskier. David said just to do the hysterectomy, despite Violet's insistence that he shouldn't be making the decision.\n\nAfter surgery, Joanna was stable and Addison told David she was able to control the bleeding without doing the hysterectomy. David was angry and decided that he wanted her transferred to another hospital as soon as possible.\n\nJoanna woke up from her surgery and said that David didn't want a baby, but she thought it would be a new start for them. She thought David would be excited like she was, but he wasn't. She got up to get him more food, but he punched her. Joanna said she didn't want to talk to the police. She wanted David dead.\n\nDavid was shocked to find that Joanna had left the hospital without him.\n\nJoanna went home with Violet to her house, where Violet took care of her while she started to heal. Joanna said that Violet's book made her feel like a failure because she'd gone back to David. She didn't want to go to the police because she didn't want to be treated like a victim. She believed it was her fault because she'd gone back to David. Violet expressed concern about Joanna saying she wanted David dead, but Joanna said she wasn't serious.\n\nThe next day, David showed up at Violet's house, angry and insisting that Joanna come with him. David blamed Violet for Joanna leaving him and hit her, knocking her out. When she woke up, she found Joanna stabbing a deceased David repeatedly.

Cooper was shocked to see that he had gained a large amount of weight. It had gotten a lot harder for him to move around, especially recently. Cooper weighed him and found that he had gained  pounds in three years.\n\nCooper consulted with Naomi and called in Justin's parents to talk about the situation. He had diabetes and high blood pressure. His father, Bruce, believed he was just lazy. They'd hired him a trainer and nutritionist and sent him to fat camp. They ruled out hormonal causes for his weight gain. Justin said he didn't want to get any bigger and he didn't feel good. While they were talking, Justin passed out. They took him to the hospital.\n\nHis blood sugar spiked, which caused dehydration. His parents argued over his case. His mother, Pam, said that he was stressed and used the food as comfort while his father said his mother coddled him.\n\nWhen Justin woke up, he told Cooper that he was being molested and that's why he kept eating, because he thought it would stop if he gained enough weight. Cooper angrily went out to the waiting room and punched Bruce, believing he was the abuser. Bruce quickly called a lawyer to sue Cooper and the hospital.\n\nCooper went back to Justin's hospital room and told Bruce he was telling the police what he'd been doing to Justin. Justin then said it wasn't Bruce. It was Pam. Pam tried to comfort him and both Bruce and Cooper told her to back away. Bruce was very angry and asked how she could hurt their son like that. Pam said that Justin loves him. Bruce then tried to attack Pam, but Cooper restrained him and had security called.\n\nNaomi brought in Sheldon to talk to Justin, who said he didn't want to talk about it. He blamed himself for his mom getting arrested. Sheldon said that being fat was his protection. He didn't know how to stop. Bruce came in and apologized for not seeing what Pam was doing to him. Justin said it was okay, but Sheldon told him not to bury his feelings, to tell his father how he really feels. Justin asked how he didn't see it, why he didn't protect him.

He told them they'd crashed and his wife was out there as well. Addison went down to the car while Sam tended to Jake. Addison found Kara and saw that she was pregnant and stuck in the car door. She had lost feeling in her fingers and told Addison they'd been out there since the previous day. Her pregnancy was at term. She said she could feel the baby moving, but Addison couldn't get the right angle to get a fetal heartbeat.\n\nSam said Jake had a broken rib and internal bleeding. Sam said if he ran, he could get back by dark. Addison said she'd go back and forth between them while they waited for him to get back. Before Sam could leave, Jake's lung collapsed and he had to improvise a chest tube to relieve the pressure.\n\nAddison climbed in the car to examine Kara and she said that she was at fault for the accident, because she grabbed her husband's arm when a bee flew in the car. Addison found that Kara had a broken rib.\n\nSam brought Jake back down to the car, saying that his chest tube needed to be opened every  minutes or his heart would arrest. Same decided to try to find the road instead of going back the way he and Addison came. However, when Addison climbed back into the car, she and Kara rolled farther down the hill. Addison was injured in the second crash, which trapped her in the car with Kara. Because she was trapped, Sam said he couldn't leave because since Addison couldn't take care of the chest tube, Jake would die if she left.\n\nAfter nightfall, Kara's water broke. Addison examined her again and determined that the baby was a footling breech because of the second crash. She attempted to change the baby's position to make the delivery easier.\n\nSam sewed the tube in Jake's chest into place so that he could leave and get help. Addison told Sam Kara's labor was progressing quickly and advised him to stay safe because they needed him to be able to come back and bring help.\n\nWhen the baby's foot came through the cervix, Addison said she was going to try to push his foot back up the birth canal and change his position from the inside. Addison started to do it, but Kara said it was too painful. Jake gave her a pep talk and said she could do it. Addison was able to change the baby's position successfully. She then coached Kara through difficult delivery.\n\nThe baby didn't breathe right away, but Addison was able to stimulate and she started crying. After the birth, Jake stopped responding to them. Addison attempted again to get out of the car, but wasn't able to. However, they heard helicopters coming to find them. They put Jake in a sling and took him to the hospital. They gave the baby oxygen and got her out of there. Then they worked on prying the door open to get Kara and Addison out. However, as soon as they did, Kara started bleeding severely from her arm and she crashed. They tried everything they could, but Kara was dead in the car.\n\nAt the hospital, Addison brought the baby to Jake and Sam told him that Kara had died.\n\n\n\nShe was married to [[Jake (The Hard Part)|Jake]] until her death.\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Kara}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Kathleen said his brother was kind of a jerk and she didn't want to have anyone's baby but his. Jeffrey begged them to find another solution so they could have a baby. They looked into the options and found a way, which involved extracting sperm directly from Jeffrey's testicles. They said it could work with only one viable sperm. They did the procedure and were able to find a single viable sperm. They extracted Kathleen's egg, inseminated it, and then implanted it back in her uterus.

Violet then ordered him to have sex with his wife, whether or not he was in the mood.\n\nThey reported back that he had erectile dysfunction, so Sam agreed to run tests to look for a physical problem. Kathy went out that night and was out all night. However, she showed up to Paul's appointment and told him she hadn't cheated, even though she'd had the chance to. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nPaul's test results showed a tumor on his adrenal gland that was causing his problems. Because of the type of tumor it was, treatment was difficult and risky, but Paul was told there was hope.\n\nAfter hearing her husband's diagnosis, Kathy spoke to Violet. She confessed that she had lied to Paul and she had slept with another man the night she didn't come home. She wanted to know what to do. Violet told her just to keep loving her husband.

When she became pregnant, she had to go off her medication, so they used alternative treatments to keep her delusions in check. She was doing well and was almost through her first trimester when she came in for treatment for morning sickness. She also had an ultrasound. When the ultrasound showed fetal demise, they tried to tell Katie, but Katie refused to believe it was true and left the practice saying she could feel the baby moving. Violet went to Katie's apartment to talk to her. Katie was still convinced that she was still pregnant, but Violet got her to agree to come to the practice by saying that Addison wanted to apologize to her. She and Violet talked, but Violet couldn't convince her that she'd had a miscarriage. While they were talking, she started to show signs of sepsis. Dell finally spoke to her and got her to believe that her baby was gone. She then consented to a D&C. ''(\"[[What Women Want]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her miscarriage, Katie continued to receive therapeutic massage. During her massage, Pete became concerned because Katie seemed euphoric. She said she was doing great despite her miscarriage, which she said wasn't causing her grief anymore. Pete reminded her that she needed to keep taking her medications. He told Violet about his concerns, so she said she'd talk to Katie about it during their session that afternoon. In the session, Violet emphasized the importance of Katie taking her medications, but Katie asked several questions about Violet's baby and touched her belly to feel the baby move. Violet agreed with Pete that Katie was off her meds and lying about it.\n\nKatie later showed up at Violet's house, saying she knew that Violet had her baby and she wanted it back. She injected Violet with a drug to paralyze her from the neck down. She then used a medical textbook and medical supplies purchased off the internet to start to cut Violet's baby out of her uterus. While she prepared, Violet tried to talk her down, to get her to remember what happened. When Violet agitated her, Katie broke her nose. She then started to cut into Violet. Violet advised her of where to cut so she wouldn't cut the baby. She talked her through how to deliver the baby step by step. ''(\"[[Yours, Mine & Ours]]\")''\n\nAfter delivering the baby, she took him and left Violet to die. She later showed up at the hospital with the baby, saying she heard about Violet on the news. She told Cooper she'd had her baby and showed him Violet's baby. He had a nurse call security and used the guise of a newborn exam to get Katie to hand the baby to Cooper. Once he had the baby, security took Katie. ''(\"[[A Death in the Family]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Katie's trial began, Pete, Naomi, and Violet were called to testify. Pete and Naomi did so, but Violet was unable to face Katie in court. Katie's father then came to Violet, asking her to go see Katie. She did and Katie said that if she went to prison, she'd slip and be crazy again and she didn't want that. Violet said that Katie had made her crazy and left.\n\nViolet said the Dr. Turner in her wanted Katie to get help, but the Violet in her wanted Katie dead. While on the stand, Violet said that she believed that Katie was delusional when she attacked Violet and stole her baby, meaning she'd get treatment instead of prison. ''(\"[[Strange Bedfellows]]\")''\n\nShe sued Violet over mentioning her in her book. After she dropped the lawsuit, it was known that it was her lawyer that complained to the medical board about Violet's license. ''(\"[[What We Have Here...]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Violet's book came out, Katie filed a lawsuit against Violet, saying publishing the book was a breach of confidentiality and was hindering her recovery. She wanted them to cease publishing and pull all copies from the shelves.\n\nViolet went to the restaurant where Katie was working to try to talk her into dropping the lawsuit.\n\nKatie then showed up at the practice and scared Violet, saying she agonized over what she'd done to Violet. She couldn't escape it. She later chose to drop the lawsuit. ''(\"[[What We Have Here...]]\")''\n\n\n\nAfter she got out of psychiatric care, she dated a man named Justin. However, his sister read Violet's book and figured out who Katie was and he broke things off with her. ''(\"[[What We Have Here...]]\")''\n\n\nShe says her mother dying was very difficult for her. It's what started her downward spiral and was the first signs of her schizophrenia. She thought the doctors had killed her mother and that people were plotting to steal her casket, so she went to the cemetery to guard it.\ua''(\"[[What Women Want]]\")''\n\n\nShe is a waitress.

She'd been in LA for six months. James called for a neuro consult because of the seizure.

At  weeks, she was on bed rest because of a blood clot. Even with heparin, she was forming more clots. Addison recommended reducing the pregnancy to one, but Angie and Simon opposed the idea.\n\nThe McConnells called in [[Vanessa Hoyt]] as a consult and she believed that it was safe for Kayla to continue the pregnancy as triplets.\n\nSam agreed to do the surgery on Kayla. It was successful.\n\nKayla was stable for a while after the surgery, but then she started forming clots above the umbrella. Addison rushed her into surgery to reduce the pregnancy load. Before she could do that, Kayla started throwing more clots and they needed to close and move her to ICU. Her heart stopped when a clot moved to her lung. There was no evidence of higher brain function and she was put on life support. The McConnells asked about the baby that was left and were told that the reduction hadn't been performed. As long as Kayla was on the ventilator, the babies would continue to grow. ''(\"[[Triangles]]\")''\n\nAs Kayla was in a coma, Eddie decided he wanted to turn the machines off, believing Kayla wouldn't want to live like that. Vanessa, opposing the decision, went to Simon and Angie and told them about it. They believed Kayla would want them to continue life support until the babies were born. Eddie still insisted he just wanted Kayla to have peace. The McConnells got a lawyer to prevent him from turning off the machines. Only essential medical personnel were allowed in Kayla's room while they waited for a judge to rule on what would happen.\n\nEddie waited outside Kayla's room in the hallway. He called some lawyers, but couldn't afford any of them. [[Charlotte King]] gave him the name of a lawyer at a non-profit aid group and encouraged him to call.\n\nThe judge came in and ruled that Kayla's life would have to continue until viability had been reached. She also ordered that her room continued to be closed to all but essential medical personnel.\n\nCharlotte later saw Eddie waiting outside Kayla's room, so she left the door unlocked and told him the nurse was on break. He went into her room and locked the door. He then disconnected her ventilator. They broke a window to get into the room, but before they could reconnect the ventilator, they saw that Kayla was breathing on her own. ''(\"[[Pulling the Plug]]\")''\n\nAfter six weeks in a coma, Eddie called in [[Geraldine Ginsberg]] to try to wake Kayla up. After she ran tests and examined Kayla, Ginsberg believed nothing could be done. However, [[Amelia Shepherd]], who was on Ginsberg's team, had an idea. Ginsberg believed it wouldn't work, so she refused to do it. When Ginsberg fired Amelia, she stayed to help Kayla. After speaking with Eddie, Amelia agreed to do the surgery.\n\nAfter hearing about what Amelia had planned, the McConnells asked her not to operate, to give them a little more time so the babies could mature more. Despite this, she operated. During the surgery, the three babies had to be delivered, but Amelia was then able to finish the procedure.\n\nAfter surgery, Kayla's reflexes started to re-emerge and she woke up.

It had started when they got married the previous year and had gotten worse.\n\nCooper removed the mask and started to examine Oliver. Cooper said eating things like he does is usually pica. He asked Oliver why he did it and he said he didn't know, but he couldn't stop.\n\nCooper consulted with Sheldon, who said it could also be OCD or nutritional deficiency. He agreed to see Oliver to try to figure out the problem.\n\nSheldon asked Oliver about Scott. He said that he likes Scott. He never had a dad before, so he gets to do cool things with him. His mom is the one who got him the mask. He said it's uncomfortable, but it helps him stop with the eating. He says he doesn't even think and he does it. While they were talking, Oliver started eating the potpourri on his coffee stable.\n\nSheldon gave him vitamins and sent him home. He ate dirt, so his mother came back in the next day. She was worried about it scaring off Scott, who had been patient through the whole thing. Cooper convinced her that she needed to let them work on figuring out what was wrong with her son so they could fix it.\n\nOliver and his parents came into the ER. They'd had an argument about Oliver and he overheard and ate something. They had to pump his stomach. He had eaten some moldy lawn furniture cushions. While getting him settled into his hospital bed, Cooper discovered Oliver's mother eating toilet paper. She also had pica.\n\nShe talked to Cooper about it. She said she'd had it since she was a child, but only when she was nervous or sad. She got it under control, but with Oliver being sick, it was too much. He said that Oliver was feeling alone and knowing that his mom had struggled with it too would have helped him. His mother had difficulty, but told him that she also had pica.\n\nOliver was upset that his mother had lied. Cooper explained that she was scared and had made a mistake. Oliver said he wouldn't forgive her. He told Oliver about a time his parents had made a mistake and he refused to forgive them. He said that even as an adult, he hadn't forgiven them for it.

Sheldon suggested talking to each of them separately, but Kelly said he wouldn't talk and Rick said it was because he talking about what happened there would bring it back. She objected that it was already there, between them.\n\nSam went to visit Rick at his house and found him unconscious after taking and overdose of pills. He called an ambulance and they took him to the ER and gave him charcoal. He woke up confused about why he was still alive. He tried to refuse their help and had to be given haloperidol to calm him down when he started getting aggressive with them.\n\nWhen Rick woke up again, he was cuffed to the bed. Sheldon said they needed to talk about his attempted suicide. Rick said military service wasn't what he expected. He started believing being sent home in a body bag would be good because it would be a release. Sheldon asked what he was thinking when he decided to take the pills. When Sheldon questioned him about his experiences, Rick admitted he'd been raped by his sergeant, Sergeant Hamill.\n\nSheldon started to get Rick to talk about being raped. He believed Hamill was going to snap his spine and froze, unable to move. Nothing felt real until he actually started raping Rick. Rick said he wished he died right there. Sheldon told him what he'd done was brave, but Rick felt that he'd been weak by letting Hamill rape him.\n\nRick didn't want to tell Kelly, saying he'd rather work it out on his own. Sheldon encouraged him, saying it could help him.\n\nRick decided to tell Kelly, but she was confused, asking how Rick could have possibly been raped by a single man, why he didn't fight Hamill off. She later told Sam she believed Rick had let it happen, but Sam corrected that he didn't let it happen. She told the story of how they met and how she believed with him around, nothing bad would happen and knowing he'd been raped shattered that illusion. She didn't feel the same looking at him after knowing he'd been raped. Sam said that Rick had been injured in Afghanistan, like her father, and she needed to look at it that way.\n\nRick told Sheldon Kelly wasn't returning his calls and he believed she'd left him. Kelly came into Rick's room at that point and took his hand.\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Rick Andrews]]. The first time they met, Rick was on leave and visiting high school buddies.

She and Rose said they'd been together for six years and they were ready to have a baby. Evan was there to be the sperm donor. They wanted to use Rose's egg, but have Kendra carry so they could both be part of the experience. Jake consulted with them and then insisted that they sit down with Violet before proceeding because they were using a known donor, so that everyone would know what the expectations and limitations were.\n\nThey sat down with Violet, who asked Evan what he saw his role as. He said he'd donate the sperm, put together the crib, and then be the cool uncle. Violet questioned what would happen when the baby got a little older and he disagreed with a parenting decision. Her insistence on the truth pressed the three of them to admit that they were a polyamorous triad and planned to raise the baby together. Violet reminded them that they'd have to raise the child in the real world, which wouldn't be as accepting of their family as they were. They believed that they had enough love that they could it through.\n\nRose and Kendra went in to be examined before starting the process. Kendra's exam was unremarkable, but Rose was informed that she had uterine scarring and ovarian failure secondary to pelvic tuberculosis, making her completely infertile. However, Jake said that Kendra and Evan would not likely have trouble conceiving without assistance if they want. Rose quickly backed out of the pursuit for a baby, saying that they couldn't do it if they couldn't all be part of it.\n\nKendra and Evan saw Violet without Rose, saying they didn't understand the problem. Violet explained Rose's point of view on them sharing something she wasn't part of. They wanted to fix it, so Violet suggested a compromise.\n\nRose went to Jake asking if there was anything he could do to make her able to participate. He said that many women come to him unable to conceive and he still finds a way to make them mothers. She was worried a baby would change everything. He said that if the love were real, it could withstand anything, but admitted he didn't actually believe that. Love's powerful, but sometimes life wins.\n\nRose went to Kendra and Evan and said she wanted a baby, but not that way. Despite that, she said she loved them and agreed to trust them and have them conceive together. Evan agreed, but Kendra said she couldn't do it. She said the reason they worked was because of the rules. They needed unanimous to avoid someone getting hurt. She said they could have a baby another way, but given the choice, she chose the three of them. Evan said it wasn't trivial. He wanted a biological child and wasn't sure he could choose the relationship above that.\n\n\n\nShe's been seeing Rose and Evan for six years. They said the first night was amazing and so was the next morning and the morning after that. To make the relationship work, they had very strict rules to follow, including one that stated all decisions had to be unanimous so no one felt ganged up on.

While he was sitting at work, his screen saver popped up, his son's face, and he remembered. He ran out to the car, but it was too late. Sheldon asked Kendra about her feelings. She said she didn't hate her husband, but she did feel numb. She needed to try to start over.

She declined to let him in the labor and delivery room because she wanted it to be about the baby and felt Kevin would make it about Jason. However, he and several other cops decided to wait out in the lobby to support her. After the baby was born, Addison brought him out to introduce him to his father's co-workers. At the end of the day, Kevin asked Addison out on a date, but she declined, saying she already had plans. ''(\"[[In Which Sam Gets Taken for a Ride]]\")''\n\n\nKevin came back to the practice to have a physical done. He came back to get the results of his physical to turn into his work. He also interacted with Addison while he was there. After that meeting, Addison went to the police department to find him. ''(\"[[In Which Dell Finds His Fight]]\")''\n\n\nKevin agreed to go on a date with Addison, but he didn't call her, so she believed he was blowing her off. However, he showed up at the practice two weeks later and showed her that he wasn't blowing her off. He had training. He had been selected to join the SWAT team. Addison brushed him off, but he later showed up at her house to ask her out on a date. ''(\"[[A Family Thing]]\")''\n\n\nWorried that Kevin might be cheating on her, Addison followed Kevin in her car. She followed him right into a tenuous work situation and she was arrested because of her proximity. This prompted a discussion about trust between the two. ''(\"[[Serving Two Masters]]\")''\n\n\nKevin and Addison returned from a date to find that someone was in her house. Kevin pulled his gun, but it turned out to be Addison's brother, [[Archer Montgomery]]. Kevin and Archer butted heads because Archer didn't believe that Kevin was rich or cultured enough for his sister. Kevin was shocked to learn that Addison has a $ million trust fund at a party. He then asked to leave early and didn't call Addison afterward. ''(\"[[Tempting Faith]]\")''\n\n\nAddison later got a call that Kevin had been shot on the job. She observed his surgery as another doctor removed the bullet. After his surgery, Addison visited him. He talked about how he didn't fit into her life and didn't feel comfortable there. Addison said that she hadn't once said he wasn't good enough and told him not to give up on them. ''(\"[[Tempting Faith]]\")''\n\nAfter he was released from the hospital, he stayed at Addison's place and she took care of him. He objected that he didn't want to feel like an invalid, but Addison said that he wasn't a burden. ''(\"[[Crime and Punishment]]\")''\n\nHe grew bored of bed rest and decided to get up and go around doing things. Addison admonished him for that. Addison later came home to find him sitting at the bottom of the steps, unable to get up. She helped him up the stairs. ''(\"[[Know When to Fold]]\")''\n\nOnce he had recovered, Kevin talked about going back to his place because he had dishes in the sink. Addison hired a cleaning lady to take care of the mess. When Kevin found out, he was upset. He also disagreed with Addison treated college call girls, saying that once you get into that life, it's hard to get out and believing Addison was enabling them by not counseling them to stop. He later gave Addison money to repay her for the cleaning lady and gardener and left her house to go home. ''(\"[[Worlds Apart]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Violet was looking for someone to talk to about whether or not [[Doug Adams]] killed his wife in cold blood, Addison sent her to Kevin. He said he'd never seen a women who killed herself or asked to be killed with a gun. ''(\"[[Crime and Punishment]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nAddison met Kevin as part of the police force that came to visit one of Addison's pregnant patient who had just given birth (and whose husband was killed in the line of duty). Kevin asked Addison out on a date. She declined, saying she had plans. ''(\"[[In Which Sam Gets Taken for a Ride]]\")''\n\nThey met again when Kevin came to the practice for a physical. After a few interactions, Addison went to the police department to find him. ''(\"[[In Which Dell Finds His Fight]]\")''\n\nKevin did not call Addison back after their date for a while and she grew agitated, but she later discovered he was training to be a SWAT officer. He showed up to her house to ask her out again. ''(\"[[A Family Thing]]\")''\n\nAddison was worried about Kevin not calling her after a date. She eventually called him and left a rambling message. ''(\"[[Equal and Opposite]]\")''\n\nAddison later saw Kevin outside the hospital. He apologized for being inconsistent and said he was there to woo her. He brought her donuts and said he shouldn't write her off. They also had burgers in between Addison's surgeries. He later took her to the shooting range to fire a gun. ''(\"[[Nothing to Talk About]]\")''\n\nThey continued seeing each other, but didn't have sex. Addison didn't want to rush into anything. Kevin invited her for a weekend in Cabo San Lucas. Addison said she had rules now and didn't want to break them. She told him about her rules and said she wanted to wait until it felt right. He said he was okay with waiting. Despite the rules, Addison later called Kevin to her house and they had sex. ''(\"[[Past Tense]]\")''\n\nTwo weeks later, Kevin and Addison were still together and Kevin spent many nights with her as she struggled to figure out how to save the practice. He helped her talk through ideas. ''(\"[[Let It Go]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship went well until Kevin told Addison that he loved her, which startled her. Because of her trust issues from cheating on Derek and being cheated on, Addison looked through Kevin's phone after he mentioned that many guys on the force were cheating on their significant others. She saw many calls from a \"Leslie,\" which raised her suspicion. She followed him around and got herself arrested when she came upon a serious work situation. He sat in the back of the car with him and explained that Leslie was a man and one of his co-workers, though he was upset that Addison didn't trust him. Kevin later came to her house asking for an explanation. She explained her history with Derek and said she wasn't ready to say she loved him, but if he stuck around, she'd get there because he's honestly and loyal and worthy of trust. ''(\"[[Serving Two Masters]]\")''\n\n[[Archer Montgomery|Addison's brother]] immediately took a dislike to Kevin, his first words to him being \"[A] Forbes-Montgomery dating a cop.\" And he later told Kevin that Addison was just enjoying him, though Addison assured him that wasn't true. ''(\"[[Tempting Faith]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship hit another snag when Addison paid for a cleaning lady and gardner to clean up Kevin's home while he was nearing the end of his recovery from a gunshot. It made him realize how different their worlds were. He later repaid her for those services and left her house. ''(\"[[Worlds Apart]]\")''\n\nAddison found that she missed Kevin after he left and decided to call him after work to tell him that she missed him. ''(\"[[Contamination]]\")''\n\nHe returned to her place, but she said that things felt different. As they ate dinner together, he was upset because she said she had to do cystic fibrosis research for a patient instead of spending more time with him. ''(\"[[Homeward Bound]]\")''\n\nKevin got suspicious about Addison returning home late after work. He kept insisting, telling Addison he's a cop and he's learned when people are lying. Eventually he let it go and apologizes, only for Addison to admit to kissing [[Wyatt Lockhart|another man]] and Kevin left. ''(\"[[Nothing to Fear]]\")''\n\n\nAddison initially met Kevin as a police officer, but after he didn't call her back after a great date, she began to wonder why. Kevin eventually returned, telling her he was training to become a SWAT officer.\n\n\n*He gets his news from \"Yahoo!\".<ref>[[Tempting Faith]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He goes go-cart racing.<ref>[[Tempting Faith]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He has a couple thousand dollars in credit card debt.<ref>[[Tempting Faith]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He lives in the valley.<ref>[[Worlds Apart]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[In Which Sam Gets Taken for a Ride]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[In Which Dell Finds His Fight]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[A Family Thing]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Nothing to Talk About]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Past Tense]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Let It Go]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Serving Two Masters]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Tempting Faith]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Crime and Punishment]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Know When to Fold]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Worlds Apart]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Homeward Bound]]\nPPKevinNelson.png|[[Nothing to Fear]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Kevin Nelson Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nelson, Kevin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Police Officers]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She tested positive for the gene associated with fibrillin disease, which caused the aneurysm.

Sheldon was able to get him to start talking once he got some food in him. Lee told him his last name and said he wasn't ready to start talking about what had happened. Sheldon retrieved Lee's file and read that he had no criminal record and had been dishonorably discharged from the Navy. He told Sheldon about having a fight with his girlfriend after catching her cheating in their bed. He said he wasn't angry and that his girlfriend was his whole world. Sheldon asked where the blood came from. He said he didn't want to discuss it. Sheldon asked about his girlfriend and he said the blood didn't belong to his girlfriend. After Sheldon talked to him some more, he admitted that he'd attacked a woman who wasn't nice, who told him he had to wait. He pushed Sheldon into a wall and was restrained. ''(\"[[Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?]]\")''\n\nLee was brought back in for a line-up, but Charlotte froze and said he wasn't in the line-up, despite recognizing him. As he was leaving, Sheldon told him he'd rape again. Lee said he didn't have proof that he did it. Sheldon said the feelings wouldn't go away and when they surfaced, he'd rape another woman. Lee said that Sheldon doesn't know him and left. Sheldon followed Lee and discovered that he had a girlfriend and a son.\n\nLee was brought back in for a second line-up and Charlotte identified him as her rapist. ''(\"[[Can't Find My Way Back Home]]\")''\n\nBecause of Charlotte's conflicting statements, the ADA decided not to charge him with her rape. ''(\"[[Just Lose It]]\")''\n\n\nLee came into the ER with a stab wound to the chest. He'd been hitting [[Nancy]], so she stabbed him. In the ER, Sam figured out that he was the man who had raped Charlotte. Because his blood wasn't clotting, they had to wait to operate until he was able to clot better in order to avoid him bleeding to death. Lee's condition worsened as they waited to operate. Lee's condition finally stabilized enough that he was taken into surgery.\n\nBefore his surgery, Charlotte came in to see him, saying she wanted to make sure that if he died, the last image he had was of her.\n\nAfter surgery, Lee woke up handcuffed to the bed. Nancy had called the police, said that he'd confessed to her about raping Charlotte. Charlotte was by his bedside and said that she'd built him up as a monster in her mind, but she realized he was nothing. She pitied him for having to beat and rape women to feel big. She then said she forgave him and left. ''(\"[[Blind Love]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe has a girlfriend, whom he found cheating on him with someone in their bed. He claimed he wasn't angry at her, as she meant everything to him. Together, they have a son.

Her sister, [[Claudine]], was even acting as a surrogate so that Lorraine and her husband, [[Elliott]], could have a baby. After Lorraine's exam, Claudine had abdominal pain, so Pete called in Addison to check her out.\n\nWhen Addison came to examine her, Pete was shocked to see Claudine and Elliott kissing. Elliott said it wasn't a tawdry affair. Before the cancer, things weren't great between him and Lorraine. Then the cancer happened and he and Claudine teamed up to take care of her. They spent a lot of time together and bonded over their shared experience. The feelings got stronger until they gave into them. Elliott planned to tell Lorraine after the baby was born. They were planning for him to leave Lorraine so they could be together.\n\nAddison said Claudine was in the very early stages of labor. Because her OB was out of town, she asked Addison to deliver the baby. She also refused to tell Lorraine about the affair. Lorraine had always wanted to be a mom, but Claudine didn't want kids. She only wanted to fall in love. It had never happened for her until Elliott.\n\nWhen the baby went into distress, Elliott comforted Claudine before she was taken for an emergency c-section, leading Lorraine to figure out they'd been having an affair. After the baby was delivered, Claudine had a lot of bleeding.\n\nAfter her surgery was completed, Addison told Claudine she'd had to perform a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding, meaning Claudine wouldn't be able to carry more children.

The patient, [[Katie Kent|Katie]], who was mentally ill, stole Lucas. She lost a baby and convinced herself that Lucas was hers. ''(\"[[Yours, Mine & Ours]]\")''\n\n\nShe left Violet to die, but she was found in time to be taken to the hospital. The baby was missing, so they put out an Amber alert. Katie later brought him to the hospital, saying she'd heard about Violet on the news. She told Cooper she'd had her baby and showed him Violet's baby. He had a nurse call security and used the guise of a newborn exam to get Katie to hand the baby to Cooper. Once he had the baby, security took Katie and Cooper gave the baby to Pete. He had bruising on his belly and was anemic. He had blood in his belly, so Addison took him into surgery. When Violet stopped clotting, Addison was forced to return to her and leave a pediatric surgeon to finish the baby's surgery. She later returned to the baby and was able to save his life. When Violet woke up, she said he was beautiful. ''(\"[[A Death in the Family]]\")''\n\nA month after Lucas was born, Pete decided to return to work. Violet, still dealing with the aftermath of the attack, had trouble holding Lucas and bonding with him. Pete told her that while everyone else could wait, Lucas didn't understand and needed her now. He said she needed to do it herself and he needed to let her, so he decided to go back to his house and leave Lucas with her. Violet later admitted to Charlotte that she didn't feel anything for Lucas. She took Lucas to Pete's house and said she wanted to be a good mother. She didn't know how to do that when she looked at Lucas and didn't feel anything. She said that being a good mother meant doing what was best for your child. She then handed Lucas over to Pete and left. ''(\"[[The Way We Were]]\")''\n\n\nAfter learning that Lucas was living with Pete, Sheldon asked Violet for a paternity test. She consented and Addison did the test, which showed that Pete was his father. ''(\"[[Right Here, Right Now]]\")''\n\n\nPete took care of Lucas, bringing him to the practice when the nanny got sick. He tried to get Violet to acknowledge him, but even after being left with him while Pete pretended to have a consult, she didn't pick him up even after he woke up. Pete then made the decision to move to [[Pacific Wellcare Center]] so that Violet wouldn't have to see Lucas constantly. ''(\"[[Pushing the Limits]]\")''\n\nWhen Pete started to date Addison, she began to spend more time with Lucas and take care of him. ''(\"[[Triangles]]\")''\n\nPete raised him with help from [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] until Violet was ready to be his mother. ''(\"[[Eyes Wide Open]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Violet returned, Pete introduced her to Lucas. She said she was ready to be Lucas's mom again. Violet then told Pete that she wanted to share custody of Lucas. Pete said that he wouldn't agree to that because of what had happened with Lucas so far. ''(\"[[Second Choices]]\")''\n\nViolet then pursued custody through the courts. Pete and Violet both hired lawyers and their friends were divided, forced to choose sides as they presented their arguments to the court. At the end of the hearing, the judge ruled that Pete would retain full custody of Lucas, with Violet getting supervised visitation. ''(\"[[War]]\")''\n\n\nDespite the ruling, Pete soon after agreed to start letting Lucas have overnight visits with Violet. ''(\"[[In the Name of Love]]\")''\n\nPete and Violet later wed, with Lucas in attendance. ''(\"[[Take Two]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Monica Bratton]] dropped Betsey back off at the practice, Violet took her home for the night. In the morning, Violet was worried because Lucas wasn't in his crib, but she found him on the couch with Betsey, watching cartoons. ''(\"[[A Better Place to Be]]\")''\n\n\nWanting Lucas to have the same childhood experience she had, Violet tried to make him a Halloween costume. However, Pete bought him a costume and said he could still have those experiences. They then took him trick or treating together. ''(\"[[All in the Family]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Pete's mother, Frances, was hospitalized after a digoxin overdose, Pete brought Lucas to visit her. Shortly after this visit, Frances died. ''(\"[[The Hardest Part]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Violet's medical license was suspended, she decided to go on a three-week book tour. However, shortly after she left, Pete had a heart attack. ''(\"[[...To Change the Things I Can]]\")''\n\nPete wasn't discovered for several more hours, when Cooper arrived to cheer him up about Violet leaving. Lucas had gotten scared and hidden under the table. Pete and Lucas were taken to the hospital, where Lucas stayed with Addison while Pete got treatment. ''(\"[[God Laughs]]\")''\n\n\nLucas went with Violet to one meeting with a mommy group. ''(\"[[Deal With It]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Violet and Pete decided to separate, Violet moved out, staying at hotel for the night, but saying she'd come back in time for breakfast in order to keep things steady for Lucas.

However, he was later found dead of a heart attack. ''(\"[[Aftershock]]\")''\n\nDuring Pete's party funeral, Amelia took Lucas, Henry, and Mason next door to Sam's house when they got bored. Lucas watched \"The Muppets\" movie. ''(\"[[Mourning Sickness]]\")''\n\nAfter Pete died, Lucas kept asking Violet where daddy was, not understanding that Pete was gone. Violet repeatedly told him that daddy isn't coming back several different ways, but nothing seemed to work, as Lucas kept asking. One night, Violet tucked Lucas in and said that she loved him. He replied, \"I love you too, Mommy.\" Then he looked toward the sky and said, \"I love you too, Daddy.\" He had finally that his father was gone.

However, Zoe said she and her husband wanted to terminate and start over with the other embryos they had stored. When Amelia heard that, she said if they terminated, she'd have the baby she was carrying and keep it.\n\nZoe later returned to the practice to talk to Amelia. Amelia told Zoe she wanted the baby she was carrying, but understood she couldn't make Zoe carry him. She believed that maybe it happened because the baby she was carrying, Zoe and Martin's, was her new chance. Naomi said sometimes, you have to let go of one dream so you can move forward with another one. Zoe said she couldn't let Amelia keep the baby, apologized, and left.\n\nZoe returned to the practice against Marty's advice and suggested that she could continue to carry Amelia's baby while Amelia carried hers and they could switch them after they were born. ''(\"[[Yours, Mine & Ours]]\")''\n\n\nZoe and Amelia began seeing another OB for their pre-natal care. However, when he found something that might be wrong with the baby Zoe was carrying, he said they needed a surgical consult and recommended Addison. Addison did an ultrasound and diagnosed a fetal teratoma that was taking over the baby's blood supply. Addison recommended surgery, but advised Zoe that she'd have to perforate the uterus, which can sometimes cause problems for future pregnancies. Martin had left her because he didn't understand the bond between Zoe and Amelia and the decision they'd made. Zoe said she couldn't do it, so Addison recommended termination. Zoe decided she wanted to wait and left the fetus die in utero naturally, to get Amelia further along in her pregnancy. She didn't want Zoe to think she'd just given up. Addison wanted her to tell Amelia, but Zoe said that she couldn't.\n\nAmelia went to see Naomi, saying she thought something was wrong with the baby and Addison and Zoe were lying to her about it.\n\nThey called Zoe in and Naomi told her about what Amelia had said to her. She reminded her about the decision she'd made. Zoe said that she felt like both babies were both of theirs. If she told Amelia what she was going to do, it would be bad for Amelia's already-high blood pressure. She was already at risk for eclampsia and they could lose both babies. Addison again recommended the surgery. Naomi told her she either needed to let Addison operate or let her end the pregnancy because that was the safest choice if she wanted to get pregnant again. Zoe said she'd do it, but they needed to tell Amelia why the surgery couldn't be done because she couldn't do it.\n\nThey called Amelia in and told her about the teratoma. Amelia said she understood. She said she was worried at first that Zoe wouldn't try to make it work. When she heard they wanted to terminate, she told Zoe she wanted to be there for her. Her blood pressure was high, so they gave her oxygen, which helped. After seeing what Amelia was going through for the baby she was carrying, Zoe decided to take the risk and have the surgery.\n\nAddison operated. Zoe was fine afterward, but Addison was unable to save the baby. Amelia said it was okay because the baby she was carrying was still okay and they were a family. When Marty showed up and made up with Zoe, Amelia left. Naomi told her she couldn't leave and keep the baby, but Amelia said he was all she had left.\n\nMartin was enraged about Amelia leaving, but Zoe said she believed that Amelia was a good person and would come back. She explained to Martin her view of it, from the time she'd spent with Amelia while Martin was gone. ''(\"[[Strange Bedfellows]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Zoe Salter]].

The parents were told that physically, Bex would be fine as the tumor was benign, but the doctors encouraged the whole family to get therapy.\n\nBex's parents came to Addison and said they didn't want to tell Bex and asked Addison to remove the male sex organs when she went in to remove the tumor.

His mother Erica raised him from the time he was born until she died. He is currently being raised by [[Cooper Freedman]] and [[Charlotte King]] following the death of his mother.\n\n\n\nMason was conceived in the back of Erica's car.\n\n\nMason met Cooper when he had his check-up. He was unaware that Cooper was his dad and thought he was just his doctor. They bonded nicely doing different activities together.\n\nMason decided he didn't want to keep seeing Cooper. When Cooper talked to him later, Mason asked if Cooper was his dad. Mason said they couldn't be friends if he was not going to be around, like the other guys. Erica and Cooper told Mason he was his dad and Cooper said he wasn't going anywhere.\ua\n\n\nEven though Erica explicitly said she didn't want Mason to meet Charlotte, Charlotte came home early and Mason and Cooper were there. Cooper introduced Charlotte to Mason. They started to bond when they were playing a video game together. Erica walked in and was unhappy to see Mason talking to Charlotte. They both left without Mason saying goodbye to Charlotte. At the end of the day, Erica returned with Mason, and said that he could have a sleepover and Mason bonded with Cooper and Charlotte.\n\n\nMason had to see his mother suffer through her brain tumor, yet he has no idea about it and just thought she was tired. One day while he was at Charlotte and Cooper's house, he wanted to see his mom, but he wasn't allowed. Charlotte turned her back for one minute and he ran out the door to see his mom. He was found only a few minutes later sitting outside on a bench.\n\nErica told him that she was sick when they were in Seattle, where Derek and Amelia would attempt to remove the tumor. He was upset, but forgave her after she came out of surgery safely. However, she was later admitted with severe abdominal pain and she threw up blood. Cooper quickly took Mason away from his mother, who was found to have metastases. She only had one more week to live in severe pain, so she refused to let Mason see her become weak and pathetic. Charlotte understood and explained this to Mason, so they arranged one last visit to say goodbye. They told each other they loved one another and Mason promised he'd be a good boy.\n\nAs Charlotte continued to care for Erica, she showed her some pictures of Mason Cooper took. Erica still decidedly refused to let him see her, resulting in a weird situation where Mason would hang out at the hospital with Cooper and Charlotte, knowing his mother was still alive. It was very tough on Mason, so when Charlotte went to deliver a final drawing of Mason's in Erica's final moments, she urged Erica to let Mason see her. Erica consented, so Charlotte quickly ran off to get Mason. They returned just in time for Mason to tell his mother that he loved her, after which she passed away. This final moment was what Mason needed to accept that his mother was truly dying, finally bursting into tears.\n\nDuring his grief process, Mason began to sleep in Cooper and Charlotte's bed, which he'd wet. He also refrained from talking. Charlotte eventually confronted him about this. He said he started to forget things about his mother, which made him sad. He knew she had asked them to talk about her and keep his life as normal as possible, but his life didn't feel normal to him at all, so he didn't want to talk about it. When Cooper later tried to get him to talk while tucking him in, Mason just turned his back towards him and remained silent.\n\n\nMason is hardworking and intelligent. His grades in school matter a lot to him, and sometimes, according to Erica, he pushes himself too hard.\ua He has a good heart and very polite.\ua He is similar to his father.\ua\ua\n\n\n\n[[Erica Warner]]\nErica was Mason's mom. He had a very loving relationship with her. After her death, he started to pee his bed and didn't talk to his dad or to [[Charlotte King|Charlotte]].\n\n[[Cooper Freedman]]\nCooper is Mason's dad. When Erica found out about her tumor, she brought Mason to LA to find Cooper. Mason was not very close with Cooper or Charlotte at first, and immediately following Erica's death, he didn't talk to either of them.

She delivered the baby and noted that the baby had a diaphragmatic hernia. They asked her what she wanted to do, but she insisted that the Sinclairs make the decision because he was their baby. Addison explained the condition to the Sinclairs and gave them two options. They decided they couldn't make the decision and left. Violet came in to counsel Judy on the decision, who was worried she couldn't make the choice and then let go of him. The surgery was successful and afterward, Judy worried about him being all alone. Dell then took her to see him. The Sinclairs returned, saying that they wanted him still, but Judy said no, because they left when things were hard. She looked at the baby and said she was going to keep him.\n\nThe Sinclairs stopped by the practice to bring the things they'd bought for the baby, wanting him to have them even though they didn't have him.

After dodging her questions, Naomi eventually told her that they weren't getting back together. ''(\"[[Let It Go]]\")''\n\n\nMaya was at the practice late with Sam, who had forgotten his wallet. He told her to wait for a minute. During that time, [[Hal Jarvis]], a pedophile who was seeing Violet after hours, sat down to talk to her. When the other adults saw, Violet pushed Hal out the door and they asked Maya what he had said to her. She said he hadn't done or said anything. ''(\"[[Tempting Faith]]\")''\n\n\nWhen her father started dating [[Sonya Nichols]], Maya met her and liked her. She even said that Naomi would like her if she got to know her. ''(\"[[Homeward Bound]]\")''\n\n\nNaomi caught Maya wearing makeup and less modest clothes to go to school and sent her back upstairs to change. That day, she came home, shocked to find that Maya had her boyfriend, [[Fillmore Davis|Dink]], over. Sam took her to live at his house and started picking Maya up from school and said that he'd start treating her like she knew right from wrong so long as she told him where she was going and with whom. When he came home to find her throwing a party, he sent everyone home. He then dropped Maya back off at Naomi's and told her to go apologize to her mother and mean it. ''(\"[[The Parent Trap]]\")''\n\n\nAfter ignoring her mother for weeks, Naomi talked to Maya, saying that she should talk to someone about what was going on, even if she couldn't talk to her own mother. Maya then went to Addison and confessed that she was pregnant. ''(\"[[Another Second Chance]]\")''\n\nWhen Maya was unable to tell them, Addison told Sam and Naomi that Maya was pregnant. Sam wondered how it could have happened while Naomi just left the room, unable to deal with it. Naomi later returned and dragged Maya into Addison's office to ask for an abortion. When Maya said she didn't want one, Naomi slapped her. Addison said that she couldn't force Maya to have an abortion. After seeing [[Lynn McDonald]] in labor, Maya agreed to have an abortion. However, when Addison took Maya in for the procedure, she said she didn't understand. Addison said she could ask whatever she wanted. Maya said she didn't understand why Naomi would do this when she believes abortion is murder. Maya then decided she didn't want the abortion. When she told Naomi about it, Naomi dragged her to see Lynn give birth and asked if she wanted that. Lynn's baby was then born and Maya was awed by seeing that. ''(\"[[Best Laid Plans]]\")''\n\nMaya had her first ultrasound with Dink there. They both thought it was pretty cool. ''(\"[[Shotgun]]\")''\n\n\nShortly before her wedding, Maya went to her mother and asked her personally to come to the wedding, saying she needed her. Naomi refused, saying her wedding was a public reminder of how Naomi had failed her. Sam came to the wedding and said that while he was a little worried, he loved her and supported her. Naomi then showed up, giving her her old, new, borrowed, and blue items. ''(\"[['Til Death Do Us Part]]\")''\n\n\nMaya came into the practice three weeks before her due date for an ultrasound. Later that day, Maya went into labor and when Dell arrived, she told him she wanted to go to the hospital. He put her in his car and started to drive her there, but on the way, they were in a head-on collision with a drunk driver. They had to be airlifted to the hospital. ''(\"[[In the Name of Love]]\")''\n\nIn the ER, Maya was examined. She said that her contractions had been bad, but she wasn't able to feel them anymore, alerting them that she had some spinal damage. They took her into surgery to deliver the baby, but as soon as Addison moved her uterus, she started to bleed out because her uterus was holding pressure on a bleeder. They packed the wound and waited for Amelia to arrive to check out her spinal damage. Amelia looked at Maya's scans and saw a fracture at L- and a bone fragment at L-. The baby had stabilized the area, but trying to deliver had de-stabilized it. Amelia said that if they delivered the baby, she'd be paralyzed. If she repaired the spine, the baby could die. Gabriel suggested hypothermia to give them more time to fix the damage, possibly buying them enough time to save both of them. They cooled her down and Amelia started working on her spine. The procedure was successful and despite having to be resuscitated after birth, Maya and the baby were both stable afterward. ''(\"[[The End of a Beautiful Friendship]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Maya was preparing to go to college, the dean of admissions at Columbia called her to say she was perfect Columbia material. ''(\"[[Two Steps Back]]\")''\n\n\nShe got into Columbia and decided she wanted to go there. When Naomi and Gabriel got engaged, they decided to move to New York so that Naomi would help Maya with Olivia while she was going to school. ''(\"[[...To Change the Things I Can]]\")''\n\n\n\nMaya once had Addison test her for STDs, which came back negative, but Maya was trying to cover for a friend of hers. Instead, Maya's friend was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy in which the fallopian tube ruptured and Addison had to take her into surgery. Maya admitted this and tells Naomi that she is still a virgin, to Naomi's relief. ''(\"[[In Which Addison Finds a Showerhead]]\")''\n\n[[Fillmore Davis]]\nMaya turned to Addison once again, revealing she was pregnant. The baby belongs to her boyfriend \"Dink\". ''(\"[[Another Second Chance]]\")''\n\nMuch to Naomi's chagrin, Maya and Dink decided to keep the baby and get married. Naomi shunned her daughter, leaving Sam to care for her. Maya and Dink decided they wanted to get married, and went to Sam for help. Sam and Dink's mother started talking, and finally gave their consent. However, Naomi was infuriated. She stated that she would take no part in planning their underage child's wedding. ''(\"[[Shotgun]]\")''\n\nThe wedding was quickly planned and the two of them married. ''(\"[['Til Death Do Us Part]]\")''\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nMaya and Addison have a close bond. Maya went to Addison when she found out she was pregnant.

Pete shared with her how [[Anna Wilder|his wife]] didn't quit smoking before she died. Pete encouraged Meg to go to Ghana, but told her to come back because he was happier when she was there. ''(\"[[Let It Go]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her trip, Meg came back to Los Angeles. She revealed that she was wearing a nicotine patch to try to quit smoking. Pete suggested more natural approaches. He attempted acupuncture on her. However, he later came home to find her smoking. He confronted her about why she was there, saying he knew she hated it there. She said she liked being around him. He said that was too much pressure on him. She later told him she wanted to be with him and admitted that she thought he'd fill a hole for her. ''(\"[[Tempting Faith]]\")''\n\n\nMeg took up running due to boredom. Pete suggested that she find a job to give her something else to do during the day. That day, Meg came into the practice to talk to Naomi. She'd offered her services to the Venice Family Clinic and they had many patients, but not enough exam rooms, so Naomi offered to let them use their space as part of their community outreach. However, she came under fire when the first patient she saw at the practice was there for an abortion.

He had been crying for  hours and wasn't able to eat or sleep. Pete and Cooper examined him and said he was small for ten days and he was malnourished and dehydrated. They questioned why she was bottle feeding instead of breastfeeding, if there was trouble latching or what. Cooper then noticed she didn't look like she'd given birth ten days prior. They figured out Eli wasn't her son.\n\nDenise explained that Eli was her brother. Her mother's a drug addict who gave birth and then left him two days later to score. Her mom had been doing it to her since she was eight. She was in foster care for a while and went back and forth. She wanted better for Eli, so she was taking care of him.\n\nEli had neonatal abstinence syndrome because of his mother's drug use and a cystic adenomatoid malformation. It needed to be removed, but operating with him being so small was risky. Pete brought in Melissa, whom he had found. She said she'd left to score drugs, but she changed her mind and got clean instead by locking herself in a motel room for eight days. She said she'd called during those eight days, but Denise didn't answer or call or her back.\n\nMelissa went in to see Eli and Denise yelled at her, saying she wouldn't let her hurt Eli. Eli started crashing and they had to rush him into surgery.\n\nAfter his surgery, Melissa said she was trying to do the wrong thing and really wanted to have the chance to be a mother to Eli.\n\nBecause of the complicated situation, they called social services, who sent [[Gladys]]. Gladys spoke to Melissa and Denise and said that if the doctors believed Melissa having Eli was to his detriment, they could explore other options.\n\nCooper spoke to Denise, telling her that Melissa would need a lot of help taking care of Eli and said that even if it didn't seem like it, they were a family and they needed to look out for one another.\n\nDenise came to see Eli in the NICU and talked to Melissa. Melissa told Denise she was sorry and Denise told her to do better with Eli.\n\n\n\nShe had two children. Her daughter, Denise, has a rough relationship with her because she used drugs for Denise's entire childhood, leading to an unstable life for her. When Eli was born, Melissa decided to get clean and Denise agreed to work on their relationship.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Melissa}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Tammy's arm was broken when her father threw her across the room and Michelle was beaten. However, Darren's injuries were the most severe. Michelle had stabbed him nine times. Cooper splinted Tammy's arm and said they'd cast it later. He also asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said she couldn't. He said that people wanted to help her and she could talk about it later. She was worried about her dad.\n\nSam examined Darren and ordered a head CT. Darren asked if he'd be okay and asked about Michelle and Tammy. Sam told him it was a little late to be worried about them.\n\nSince Michelle was pregnant, Addison did an ultrasound and said that the baby looked fine for ten weeks. She then asked Michelle if Darren hitting her and Tammy happened often. Michelle said it was an accident and asked to see Tammy. Addison asked again about the attack. Michelle said it wasn't like that. She said she was cooking. She and Darren started arguing and Tammy got in the way, so Darren pushed her. She got mad, overreacted, and stabbed him. As Addison took her to see Tammy, police officers showed up at the hospital to arrest Michelle. Addison said she needed medical care, so they told Addison to admit her to the jail ward and handcuffed her.\n\nMichelle and Darren had conceived with assistance from Naomi because they wanted a sibling for Tammy.\n\nDarren continued to insist to Sam that it was an accident. Darren had a seizure due to a brain contusion, which caused swelling in his brain. Sam put him in a drug-induced coma. They gave him mannitol to try to reduce the swelling in his brain.\n\nMichelle maintained that Darren wasn't abusive, even when Addison advised her that she could go to jail if Darren died.\n\nCooper talked to Tammy about her dad being in a coma. He asked her to talk about what happened because her mom wasn't talking. He wanted her to tell the truth about what happened. She admitted that she was supposed to say it was an accident, but it wasn't. She was cutting a cantaloupe. Her dad came in and was being silly, singing along with the radio, but she got mad. She just gets so mad sometimes. Her dad could see that was happening. He held her to try to calm her down, but she bit him. He called for her mom, but Tammy still had the knife in her hand and stabbed him. And she was upset because he was going to die.\n\nWhen Michelle was released from custody, she realized that meant that Tammy told the truth about what had happened. She believed it was her fault because she'd used drugs during her pregnancy with Tammy. Tammy had ADHD and then the rages started. Her school counselor said it was just adolescence, but Michelle was convinced it was her fault, because the test hadn't showed any other cause. She said Darren was the strong one and she needed him, but he was in a coma and she was worried Tammy would be taken away.\n\nWhen juvenile officers came to take Tammy, Cooper asked to keep Tammy in the hospital for longer. He went to Tammy's room and found her in a rage, attacking a nurse. He restrained her an ordered lorazepam to calm her down.\n\nThe next day, Cooper consulted with Addison. Everything Cooper ran was negative, but Addison ordered an abdominal MRI, which showed an ectopic pheochromocytoma on her ovary. It released the excess adrenaline, which caused the rages. Addison told Michelle and Tammy about it and assured Michelle that nothing she did caused it. It was a simple surgery to remove it and then she wouldn't have the rage anymore. Tammy said she still felt guilty about her father.\n\nDarren was still in his coma when Addison took Tammy into surgery. He wasn't a surgical candidate, but wasn't waking up.\n\nCooper talked to Tammy about her guilt, saying it wasn't her fault and he knew that people saying that wasn't making her feel better. She asked what would happen if he died and she didn't get to say she was sorry.\n\nDarren woke up and Tammy visited to tell him she was sorry.\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Darren Larsen]].\n\n\nShe worried that her daughter, Tammy, had problems because she used drugs before she knew she was pregnant with Tammy.

She told him she had breast cancer as they waited. They didn't initially recognize each other, but at their second session together, she put together that he was the same man. She apologized for being rude when they first met in radiation, saying she'd gotten close to other cancer patients before and it hurt when they died. Because of this, she told Sheldon they could chitchat in the office, but it couldn't go beyond that. They talked during their treatment each morning. During one session, Miranda told Sheldon her cancer had metastasized to her brain and the radiation was just to buy her enough time to go to her niece's college graduation. One morning, she told him she was thinking of trying a new place down the street for lunch. Instead of accepting the unspoken offer, he told her to let him know how it was.\n\nOne morning when Sheldon went in, Miranda wasn't there. He believed it was because she had died. However, at his next session, he sat in the chair she normally occupied and she came out of the treatment room, saying somethings about car trouble. He was happy to see her and kissed her. He then said he wanted to see her outside the office. She reminded him that she was dying, but he said she wasn't dying today and they kissed again. ''(\"[[I'm Fine]]\")''\n\n\nThe first of Sheldon's friends Miranda met was Violet when they went to lunch together. Rather than saying that they met at radiation, Sheldon shared only the vending machine story. Miranda said she felt bad for lying to Violet about the cancer, saying Sheldon needed to talk to someone about the cancer and Miranda. He said he wasn't ready to think about her being gone. She told him to let his friends in. ''(\"[[Full Release]]\")''\n\n\nMiranda attended Jake and Addison's wedding at Sheldon's date. At the wedding, she met more of Sheldon's friends. ''(\"[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Miranda visited Sheldon at the practice, she fell to the ground and started seizing. They rushed her to the ER, where Sheldon was faced with the reality that Miranda was really dying. When she woke up after her seizure, she'd been admitted to the hospital and Amelia wanted to keep her for observation. She agreed to stay for only one night. After that night, she decided to leave against medical advice. Sheldon tried to get her to stay, saying he'd be there with her every day, but she said no matter what the doctors did, she was going to die. She had a long, painful decline ahead of her. He offered to take her home and take care of her, but she said she didn't want that. She didn't want him with her during the bad part. She told him to walk away. He later came back and said that he wouldn't and he wanted to spend her last days with her. He quit his job and they sat on a beach together.

After several weeks of polite chitchat, Sheldon told Miranda he wanted to see her outside the office because she lit up the room and he wanted that light in every room. ''(\"[[I'm Fine]]\")''\n\nWhen she started to decline rapidly and knew the end was near, she tried to break up with Sheldon, saying she didn't want him to watch her lose her faculties and then die. Sheldon later decided to quit his job and went to Miranda, saying she didn't get to push him away. He said he wasn't leaving and he was happy to take care of her however he could. He'd cherish her last days and surround her with love. She said she was wrong and they decided to go be on a beach together.

When Violet went to lead the family out of the room while they cracked her chest, she noticed that Missy was looking at what they were doing intently.\n\nDrea's parents were upset about her injuries and Violet saw that Missy didn't seem upset, so she asked their father, Gary, if he wanted her to speak to Missy to see how she was feeling about the situation.

About % of them identify as male and % as female as adults. Naomi said they could have the parents choose and alter the genitalia to reflect that and support it with hormone therapy, but Addison said they should raise the baby how they want now, but leave the genitalia as is until the child is an adolescent. Naomi said the ambiguity would create problems for the child's whole life.\n\nThe doctors went to the Thompsons with the options and they said they figured it was best to figure out a solution and put it behind them. They decided on surgery, but instead of giving the baby female genitalia, they said they wanted male genitalia, despite only a % chance the baby would orient to male.\n\nAddison agreed to do the surgery, but as she prepared to operate, she changed her mind and told the parents that the baby was fine and had no problems, but she couldn't do the surgery.

Addison finally met Morgan's husband and was shocked to see that it was [[Noah Barnes]], the doctor she'd been flirting with at work. ''(\"[[Finishing]]\")''\n\nMorgan ended up in the hospital with serious pain. Addison came to the hospital and examined her and diagnosed a kidney infection. She started antibiotics. Addison suggested that Morgan's care be transferred to a hospital-based doctor. Morgan wondered about it, saying she thought she and Addison were friends. Addison said she'd send over a list of names and apologized. Noah came to Addison, pleading with her to be Morgan's doctor again, saying he could control himself. She agreed and continued caring for Morgan. Morgan's infection cleared and she was released from the hospital. ''(\"[[What Women Want]]\")''\n\nAddison did a house call to check on Morgan and found that her cervix had opened and her amniotic as was protruding. She wanted to sew Morgan's cervix shut, so the called an ambulance to take her to the hospital for surgery. Before her surgery, she threw a pulmonary embolism and coded, but they were able to defibrillate. Her surgery was postponed until the next day while she rested. Before her surgery the next day, Morgan insisted that Addison find Noah first because he was missing. Addison found Noah and he said that he couldn't look at Morgan because in his soul, he was cheating on her. She convinced him to come and he showed up while she was doing the cerclage. ''(\"[[Do the Right Thing]]\")''\n\nWhen Morgan was at term, Addison removed the cerclage and told Morgan she could give birth anytime. Before long, Morgan went into labor. Addison attended to her for a while, but then turned her care over to Dell. ''(\"[[Yours, Mine & Ours]]\")''\n\n\nMorgan later returned to the practice with the baby, asking Addison again if she'd slept with Noah. Addison assured her that she hadn't. The next day, she returned and apologized to Addison. Addison wished her and Noah well. Morgan came back again and said she could have forgiven sex, but she'd figured out that what happened between them was emotional, not sexual. Addison admitted that they had fallen in love, which Morgan believed was worse. ''(\"[[Right Here, Right Now]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Noah Barnes]]. Their relationship was strained by her miscarriages and before she got pregnant for the third time, they were going to try being apart for a while. She believed the baby would be their second chance. ''(\"[[Do the Right Thing]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Addison was tending to Morgan's pregnancy, they got along quite well, at least until Morgan began to suspect that Addison was sleeping with her husband. She asked Addison directly if they were sleeping together, which she said they were not.

She married [[Sam Bennett]] twice, with whom she has a daughter, [[Maya Bennett|Maya]], and is expecting another child. She is the best friend to Addison Montgomery and a founding partner of the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]].\n\n\n\nIn High School, Naomi was extremely overweight and had to endure many jokes and nicknames about her weight.\n\nWhile attending Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Naomi met [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], [[Mark Sloan]], and [[Sam Bennett]]. Eventually, Naomi married Sam and had a daughter, [[Maya Bennett|Maya]].\n\n\nWilliam White and Naomi were at dinner when he explained that he wanted to create a leading medical practice, and wanted Naomi to run it. She initially declined the offer, but William told her that he had been researching and found that she was one of the best fertility specialists, and she built one of the first whole wellness medical practices. She said she wasn't interested.\n\nLater, William met her at the practice and invited her to lunch, where Naomi discussed how the practice was her \"baby\" and that the people working there were her family. William admired that, but he said that he would be back in two weeks to make an official offer to her.<ref>[[What You Do for Love]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nNaomi later confided in Addison that she was offered Charlotte King's job to run Pacific Wellcare Center. Addison was surprised and said that Oceanside was Naomi's practice, but she said that it wasn't hers anymore because of the recent events that happened and that she was considering the offer.<ref>[[Yours, Mine & Ours]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile travelling around the world doing work for the William White Foundation, Naomi felt a new purpose in her life. Each time, it became harder for her to take a break from that work and return to the practice and its debates and the sometimes morally questionable decisions that were made there. When [[Gabriel Fife]] returned from D.C. in an attempt to pursue her to move back there with him, she began to contemplate starting over. Though she initially turned him down, citing her obligations to the practice and her family, now also including [[Betsey Parker]], Sam pointed out that she was merely making up excuses not to be loved. Letting go of all her obligations, Naomi then rushed to the airport to chase Fife. She came too late to board the plane but was surprised when Fife showed up. He had gotten off the plane as he had strongly suspected she would show up. He then pulled out a ring and proposed. She happily accepted and told him they were moving to New York City rather than D.C. so that she could help out Maya, who had been accepted into Columbia University.\n\n\nNaomi returned to Los Angeles for Addison and Jake's wedding and was Addison's maid of honor.\n\nAfter speaking with Sam at the reception, they ended up having sex, which resulted in Naomi becoming pregnant. When she visited Addison again, Addison did an ultrasound and Naomi admitted that she and Fife weren't together anymore. Addison did the math and figured out that Naomi had gotten pregnant at her wedding and Naomi confessed that she had slept with Sam, though she refused to tell Sam about the pregnancy.\n\nAfter Naomi went back to work, Sam interrupted Naomi's meeting and professed his love for her. Naomi then tells him that she was going to have a baby, and they kissed.<ref>[[In Which We Say Goodbye]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nNaomi has a very sunny personality and is often the person people go to, to confide in. She is very smart and confident in her field. She believes in faith and is a great person to hang out with. She also eats chocolate when she is stressed, sad, or even mad.\n\n\n\n[[Sam Bennett]]\nSam and Naomi dated in college and after college, they married almost immediately. They had a daughter and after many years of happiness, Sam woke up one morning and decided he wanted a divorce. Naomi worked alongside her ex-husband, [[Sam Bennett|Sam]], with whom she had a relatively friendly, but often strained, relationship, for many years before she left [[Los Angeles]] to be with [[Gabriel Fife]].\n\nShe later returned to [[Los Angeles]] for [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison's]] wedding, at which she had a one-night stand with Sam, which resulted in a pregnancy.\n\nThree months later, Naomi returned to L.A. where Sam, oblivious to the fact that Naomi was pregnant, declared his love for her again. Naomi revealed her pregnancy to him and the two reunited and re-married.<ref>[[In Which We Say Goodbye]], x (PP)</ref>\ua\n\n[[Dell Parker]]\nDell Parker, the office receptionist, had a crush on Naomi, and often showed it by getting her coffee, bringing her home-baked chocolate cake, and generally complimenting and adoring her. Naomi didn't take this crush seriously, calling him a \"kid,\" but Dell decided to fight for her and kissed her. He admitted he didn't have it all together, but he told her he was a man, not a kid. Only seconds later, Sam also kissed Naomi, encouraging Dell to fight for her even harder.\n\n[[Archer Montgomery]]\nFollowing the separation, and the brief fling with Sam, she began seeing other people, until she inadvertently slept with [[Archer Montgomery]], to Addison's dismay. Addison told her that Archer would only hurt her. Unfortunately for Naomi, Addison was right, catching Archer ending a date with another woman and walking in on Archer after he had sex with [[Charlotte King]]. Afterward, he left, leaving Naomi devastated.<ref>[[Wait and See]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAfter a long time apart, they had another one night stand when his mother died.<ref>[[Home Again]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n[[William White]]\nNaomi initially met William when he was convincing her to run a practice that he owned. She declined multiple times, but he met her at the practice and invited her to lunch, where she still declined his offer.<ref>[[What You Do for Love]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nNaomi began dating him, but he later died. It began as a flirtation before she had to write a speech about him.\n\n[[Gabriel Fife]]\nThey first met when he was hired at her new job. They were antagonistic at first. She became engaged to Gabriel Fife and was raising Dell's daughter Betsey with him until they separated at some point after they left [[Los Angeles]].\n\nOthers\nNaomi had her first date since college, which didn't go too well because all she could talk about was her job.<ref>[[In Which Charlotte Goes Down the Rabbit Hole]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n[[Maya Bennett]]\nMaya is Naomi and Sam's daughter. Naomi wanted her to get an abortion after learning that Maya was pregnant. However, when Maya chose not to, Naomi was upset at her and retreated into her work. She ignored Maya's decision to get married to her boyfriend. She later followed Maya to New York to help her adjust to college.\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nNaomi and Addison have been friends since medical school. They consider each other best friends, but they hadn't spoken after Addison's divorce with Derek until Addison's trip to LA. After Addison joined the practice, their friendship grew stronger again. The friendship hit a rough patch during Addison's and Sam's relationship, but they were able to overcome this over time and got back to being great friends.\n\n\nDr. Naomi Bennett is a [[Board Certification|board-certified]] [[Board Certification#American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology|reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist]], as well as a founding partner of the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. Although Dr. Bennett's primary area of expertise is in fertility, she is also board certified in obstetrics and gynecology. She is a member of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, and the [[Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]].\n\nThe owner of [[Pacific Wellcare Center]], [[William White]] visited Naomi and asked her to lunch, with the intention of offering her a job as the new director of Pacific Wellcare. Naomi refused initially, but William started making points about what he could offer, such as leadership of the practice, which Naomi feels she no longer has at [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. She eventually takes the job, and in the process, Charlotte King is fired.\n\nWilliam's reasons for hiring her were because she has a heart, where he can obtain the best people in their field for his practice, Naomi is the reason they will stay.\n\n\n*She is Catholic.\n*She loves cake, particularly cheesecake.\n*Naomi hates pilates.\n*She does the crossword puzzle in the newspaper in pen because she rarely makes mistakes in them.<ref>[[In Which Sam Receives an Unexpected Visitor]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Despite having two [[Board Certification|board certifications]] in [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] and [[Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility|REI]], she has never been referred to as \"double-board certified\".

He reminded her that she wanted to be able to fly again. He talked her through what had happened on her aborted flight the day before. She said she didn't know what had triggered her anxiety.

She had unbuckled her seat belt, but the woman next to her couldn't get hers undone. She asked Natasha for help, but Natasha left her and exited the plane, saving her own life.\n\nTo get Natasha to come back to therapy, Sheldon went to her house and told her a story of when he led to someone's death and gave up.

They found Wendell and Nate fighting with the other residents watching and placing bets. They tried to break up the fight, but Wendell and Nate fought through. Wendell knocked Nate to the ground and Sam stepped in and said that Nate needed an ambulance.\n\nAt the hospital, they determined that Nate had had a heart attack and they were trying to relieve the blockage. Wendell said they needed something to make the days more exciting. In response, the nursing home put a look on the basement to keep them from going down there to fight. Dell visited Wendell and Wendell admitted that he should have known better.

Nick said he'd deny it if Sheldon said anything. Nick said that he could handle it.\n\nRachel came in and Addison examined her for possible causes for her rages. Her tests showed excess testosterone in her blood, which was caused by metastatic breast cancer.

He doubted that, because he's had the urges since he was a teenager. He thought he'd outgrow it, but he didn't.\n\n\nNick became depressed over his urges and went to see a therapist,\ua[[Sheldon Wallace|Dr. Sheldon Wallace]]. During their first session, he said it would be the last session. He came to say goodbye because he was going to kill himself. He thought that would be best, as he was unable to find happiness.\n\nHe confessed he took pills, but refused to go to the hospital. Sheldon wanted to know why he did this. Nick then confessed he thought about his -year-old goddaughter Stella when he had sex. He assured Sheldon he never acted on his desires, but he couldn't stop fantasizing every time he drove by an elementary school on his way to work. He masturbated at home to relieve himself, but like Sheldon, Nick feared that would make it start to seem normal after some time. Refusing to give in to his urges, killing himself seemed like the only option.\n\nSheldon didn't want to give up on his patient and said that there were ways to handle the urges, including avoiding mood swings, keeping himself busy and maintaining structure in his life. There would be no problem as long as he didn't act on his urges. Nick was touched that Sheldon wanted to help him, but he then collapsed. Sheldon called  and Nick confessed he came to his office as he didn't want to die alone.\n\nThey were still in time to prevent death. Sheldon asked Nick if he was going to do it again, but Nick didn't know. Sheldon said he studied buddhism, which taught him that suffering can change a person to their core, which is why he believes every life is worth saving. Sheldon once again offered to really help Nick, as long as Nick didn't keep any more secrets. Nick said he didn't have any more to keep, marking the start of regular therapy sessions.\ua''(\"[[Mourning Sickness]]\")''\n\n\nNick was admitted to the ER some time later because of an adverse reaction to his meds, which Sheldon assured him was normal when the dose is adjusted. Nick was relieved as he thought they would have to stop the treatment, which he really felt was working. His urges happened less frequently and he managed to control them. Sheldon acknowledged they were making progress.\n\nUnknown to Sheldon, Nick saw how upset [[Sarah Nelson]], a little girl, became when her parents started fighting in front of her. When she ran outside to flee from their fighting, Nick went after her and found her hiding from the rain because he wanted to give her a better life, away from her horrible fighting parents. He took her home, which was less than a mile from the hospital, and locked her up in his basement. He then returned to his bed in the ER, right before Sheldon came to check up on him. Nick pretended to be innocent and hurt that Sheldon didn't trust him, ignoring Sheldon's calls after that night.\ua\n\nImmediately after a Sarah's disappearance was noticed, Charlotte called a code pink, but Nick and Sarah were already outside at that point. When Sarah's rain coat was found outside the hospital, everyone assumed she was kidnapped and not to be found at the hospital anymore.''\ua(\"[[You Don't Know What You've Got Till It's Gone]]\")''\n\n\n[[Ron Nelson|Ron]] and [[Dana Nelson]]\uaorganized search parties with volunteers and raised awareness around the hospital with gatherings and posters. Violet and Cooper helped them out, and Violet even got them an interview with the national press. Nick obviously ignored their requests to let their girl come home, all the while continuing to hide Sarah in his basement and trying to build a relationship with her.\ua''(\"[[The Next Episode]]\")''\n\n\nEventually, Nick returned to Sheldon's office. Sheldon stated he was worried after what happened. Nick assured him he didn't take the girl and their therapy sessions continued. Nick stated he was doing well, keeping his urges under control by avoiding triggers and keeping himself busy. He claimed he met someone named Alyssa, a nice woman he met with whom he shared a lot of interests. Alyssa was in fact Sarah, but Nick pretended that she was . He told Sheldon they weren't in a romantic relationship yet, but that he wanted it to be.\n\nUnbeknownst to Nick, Sheldon remained suspicious. At one point, Nick thought about cancelling therapy, but he came anyway because he wanted to share his happiness with Sheldon, who understood what it took for Nick to get there. The therapy sessions continued and Nick expressed concern, wondering if he deserved his happiness. Hearing that Nick was happy in his relationship with \"Alyssa\" alarmed Sheldon more.\ua\n\nIn one of the following sessions, Nick stated he'd like to take his relationship with Alyssa to the next level, but he was afraid sex would change their relationship. Sheldon informed him that sex shouldn't always be seen as the ultimate expression of love and that taking it slow was healthy. During the next session, Nick told Sheldon that his relationship with Alyssa wasn't growing anymore and that she didn't seem happy, making him think love wasn't in the cards for him. Sheldon tried to tell him that he should give it time, but Nick already decided that he was going to end with Alyssa. He looked sad and said he didn't want to hurt her.\n\n\nNick was called in on the day that Sarah was missing for  days. Sheldon pretended he had to leave town and thereby had to reschedule, but Sheldon wanted Nick to see Sarah's parents, who had a session with Violet at that exact time. Nick barely reacted to that and they went into his office. Nick said he hadn't broken up with Alyssa yet. Sheldon then steered the conversation towards Sarah. Sheldon voiced concern over her wellbeing and wondered if she was alive. Nick said he thought Sarah was okay and that maybe Sarah was having a better life, away from her awful fighting parents. Sheldon then said he suspected Nick was holding something back, despite their deal to be honest. Sheldon then asked him some questions about Alyssa, but it took Nick some time before he could answer, indicating he was making up the answers. Sheldon then accused him of taking Sarah and making up Alyssa.\n\nNick tried to deny this and asked why he'd come back to therapy if he had taken her. Sheldon suspected he did that because his urges were getting too much and he actually wanted to confess. Nick said he was crazy. Sheldon bounced back that Sarah didn't love him and guessed that maybe Nick couldn't perform, couldn't be a man with her. Nick yelled that Sheldon was just guessing and didn't know anything. Sheldon asked where Sarah was, but Nick claimed he couldn't help him with that. Nick walked out, only to bump into police officers standing outside the office. Sheldon told them Nick was acutely suicidal, paranoid and externalizing, so he put him in a  psychiatric hold.\n\nAfter Nick's arrest, Sheldon went to\ua[[Joe Price|Detective Price]]\uaand told him Nick had confessed. Along with some police officers, they went to search Nick's house, where they found Sarah in a hidden room in the basement.\ua''(\"[[I'm Fine]]\")''\n\n\nNick ended up in solitary confinement. He became depressed again and reached out to Sheldon, but it's unknown if Sheldon ever went to see him. Sheldon discussed the problem with Violet and Charlotte, unsure what his obligation was to Nick after all that happened. While Violet thought it could help him to go see Nick, Charlotte said Sheldon's only obligation was to himself, adding that Nick deserved to rot alone.\ua''(\"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\")''\n\n\n\nNick claimed to have fallen in love with Sarah Nelson.\n\n\nNick grew up in a Catholic family, where he was taught that God makes no mistakes.\n\n\nIt's unknown what Nick does as a job, but he is employed as he mentioned to Sheldon that he got a promotion.\n\n\n*Nick is the last patient to be treated on screen by\ua[[Sheldon Wallace|Dr. Sheldon Wallace]].\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPxNickCalhoun.png|[[Mourning Sickness]]\nPPxNickCalhoun.png|[[You Don't Know What You've Got Till It's Gone]]\nPPxNickCalhoun.png|[[I'm Fine]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\nPPx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Nick Calhoun Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Calhoun, Nick}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He got her to open it again by saying that Braden might not be autistic. He suggested instead that he had Landau-Kleffner syndrome.

During the pregnancy, she was told she couldn't have sex because she was at risk for miscarriage if she did. She was later placed on full bed rest.

While treating Morgan for the infection, Addison felt uncomfortable by Noah's presence, so she decided she couldn't be Morgan's doctor anymore. However, Noah talked to her and convinced her to continue working with Morgan, saying he could control himself. ''(\"[[What Women Want]]\")''\n\nWhen Morgan's cervix started to open, Addison decided to do a cervical cerclage. Noah stayed away from her hospital room because he couldn't look at her knowing that in his soul, he was cheating on her by wanting Addison.

He initially didn't recognize her, but when he did, he apologized and talked to her about a case he was working on. She suggested that he talk to [[Charlotte King]] about his case.\n\nAnother month later, they met again in the scrub room as both were starting. Noah admitted that he'd missed Addison, though he said he shouldn't say that.\n\nThey talked in a lounge, holding hands and Addison pointed out that they didn't know each other's names. She told him her name and he pulled his hand back abruptly and said he needed to leave. Addison learned that he was married to one of her patients. He talked to her later and said she'd been where he was, one step away from doing something stupid and advised him not to take the step. He said he wanted to take the step and leaned in to kiss her, but she got up and left. ''(\"[[Finishing]]\")''\n\nAddison removed herself from Morgan's case, as she was not comfortable with her feelings for Noah while she treated his wife, feelings which Noah reciprocated. Noah, however, asked her not to leave the case, as she was the best in her field and Morgan could not lose another child, and he would keep his feelings for Addison in check. ''(\"[[What Women Want]]\")''\n\nHowever, Noah could not help the way he felt, and Morgan realized her marriage was in jeopardy. She asked Addison to save her child, as that was all that was keeping her and Noah together. She said she saw it in Noah's eyes: he was there, but he wasn't quite there. When Addison had to perform surgery on Morgan, Noah was not there for her and Morgan was willing to put off the surgery to have Addison find Noah and he eventually went into the OR to be there for Morgan, with a push from Addison. That night, he showed up at Addison's house and they shared a kiss. Addison broke the kiss and pushed Noah back out the door.

''(\"[[What You Do for Love]]\")''\n\nWhen Morgan grew suspicious, Addison and Noah talked and Noah said he wanted to confess to Morgan what had happened, despite Addison saying it would destroy her life. He said it would be honest and then they could be together. When the time to confess came, Addison stopped him from telling Morgan. Noah later found Addison and told her he loved her.

Ollie mentioned to Cooper that the medicine made him not hungry anymore. Cooper discovered that his parents had been giving him the amphetamines on their own, leftover from their older son. His mother confessed that they wanted him diagnosed with ADHD so he'd get extra time on his tests. They had invested a lot in his education and didn't want that to be wasted.\n\nCooper later went to his house and said what they were doing was child abuse, both giving him the pills and the pressure they're putting on him.

Cooper decided to order an MRI and have Amelia consult. He was being raised by his grandfather, Dennis, after his parents died in a car accident when he was five.\n\nThe MRI showed a large brain tumor in the area of Patrick's brain that controls hand function. Amelia recommended surgery, but said the safest option meant that Patrick might lose all function in his right hand, meaning he wouldn't be able to play piano. The alternative was an awake craniotomy, in order to allow her to track progress and monitor his hand function as she worked. But because it would take longer, there was a risk he'd end up with paralysis in his right leg. Patrick said he needed piano and asked Dennis to let him have the surgery because he needed piano, but didn't need his legs.\n\nHowever, Dennis said they were going to go with the safer option, though Patrick said it wasn't what he wanted. Amelia and Cooper informed them that they couldn't do what Patrick wanted without Dennis's consent and they also couldn't do what Dennis wanted without Patrick's consent. It would become a matter for the courts. They'd probably rule with Dennis, but they didn't have time to wait for that. Patrick said Dennis could either let him do the awake craniotomy or let him die.\n\nCooper went to talk to Patrick, who said that being a musician was the most important thing in the world to him. He also said that music was his entire relationship with his grandfather. After his parents' funeral, Dennis never looked at him until he started to teach him to play piano. He believed Dennis couldn't learn another way to bond with him.\n\nAmelia brought Dennis in and said that they needed to talk to each other and choose a surgery because his tumor would keep growing. Dennis said he loves Patrick, even though he doesn't say it. Amelia told him what Patrick had said about his relationship and said Dennis needed to tell Patrick he loves him. He became angry, saying she didn't understand, but after she told him about her father's death, he said to do the surgery if that's what Patrick wanted.\n\nPatrick was taken in for surgery and believed his grandfather wouldn't show up to see him before the surgery because he only loved him for his music. During the surgery, Patrick played piano in order to give Amelia an idea of which areas she could cut into and which she couldn't. He said he wished Cooper had been right about his grandfather loving him no matter what.\n\nDennis arrived at the hospital after Patrick was already in surgery. He regretted agreeing to the surgery, saying he thought if he gave Patrick what he wanted, Patrick would know how he felt. Not wanting to risk Patrick dying before he had a chance to tell him, Cooper brought Dennis into the OR to tell Patrick he loved him. At that moment, Patrick started bleeding and said he couldn't feel his hand. Cooper took Dennis back out of the OR while Amelia worked to stop the bleeding.\n\nAmelia later came out and told Dennis she'd gotten the whole tumor. They wouldn't know until he woke up if he'd have any paralysis, but she was hopeful.\n\n\n\nHis parents died in a car accident when he was five and his grandfather has been raising him ever since.\n\n\n*He was  at the time of his surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hoffman, Patrick}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He called Naomi to deliver the baby, but by the time she arrived, the baby was born. Naomi had to tell Ashley that the baby was a boy. She was upset and demanded a girl.

Her husband didn't really help with the parenting. He preferred just to be their friend.\n\nThe doctors called Patrick in and confronted Patrick along with Ashley. They said he needed to grow up and become a parent. Naomi then also said that Ashley needed to grow up. She needed to take the boy she got and not get upset.

He was married to\ua[[Violet Turner]], with whom he has a son named\ua[[Lucas Wilder|Lucas]].\n\n\n\nDuring his childhood, Pete had to clean up after his mother while his brother, Adam, made excuses. She was an alcoholic 'A party all by herself', and liked a lot of men. She met a serious partner, Henry, but later stabbed him to death when he tried to leave in front of Pete, who was especially close to Henry and the age of fifteen. He is now estranged from his brother and does not know who his father is.\n\n\nBefore her pregnancy, Violet was sleeping with both Pete and Sheldon. During her whole pregnancy, no one knew who was the biological father. Cooper came to live with her to help her with her pregnancy. She was treating [[Katie Kent]], who was pregnant, but lost the pregnancy. Kate refused to accept this and wouldn't allow them to do a D&C to remove the dead tissue. With Violet's help, Katie came to terms with it and she continued treatment with Violet.<ref>[[What Women Want]], x (PP)</ref> During this time, Violet chose to be with Pete and Sheldon had to just sit back and did not really say anything but hoped the baby would be his. She was overdue and was tired of being pregnant and wanted it out but still went to work every day. One day, Katie came to her door while she was home alone. Katie stabbed her with a syringe that caused Violet to be conscious but unable to move from her head down. Katie believed Violet's baby was her own.

Violet came home as soon as she found out and later became the object of Pete's post-heart attack frustration.<ref>[[God Laughs]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAfter Pete's heart attack, their relationship was strained and uncomfortable. Once Pete was cleared for all physical activity, they slept together, however they both confided in others saying it was awkward and not as good as it used to be. While Pete was grieving his attack, he said passive aggressive comments to Violet, and treated her poorly, however Violet dismissed it because the psychiatrist in her said it was just the grief talking. During Amelia's intervention, she verbally attacked both of them saying to Violet that Pete didn't want her anymore and she was just an aging old woman, and told Pete that saving his life after the brain bleed following the heart attack, may not have been worth it, and \"God's angels should have just taken him then\". Both Pete and Violet escaped into the kitchen where they laughed hysterically at the things Amelia said to them, and it felt like the old them. However time past and things were still strained and not normal. Violet and Addison had grown closer as Addison was trying to get pregnant and Violet was helping her, and while they were talking one day, Violet realized something. She found Pete in his office and started talking. She said that she didn't want to be like Anna, Pete's previous wife until her death. She didn't want Pete to feel obligated to stay with her even though he was miserable. But she also knew that Pete didn't have it in him to leave. So she said that if Pete didn't want their marriage to continue, ''she would leave him'', so he wouldn't have to feel guilty, and they would figure out a way to share Lucas. She told Pete to think about that, and left his office. Later, while they were sitting at their table, Violet asked if Pete had thought about what she said. He responded saying, \"I'm sorry Violet.\" Meaning he wanted to end their marriage. Violet's reaction was unclear but she said that they should keep things as normal as possible for Lucas, and they should still go to Addison's thanksgiving dinner together, for Lucas. She then picked up her bag, and walked out of the house.\n\n\nPete had had a heart attack previously. He also got in trouble with the law because he illegally took a man who wanted to die off of life support. He was resistant to agree with the court so he was held until he cooperated. Violet talked Pete into cooperating with the court and he got out and had to go to a preliminary court hearing. On the day of the hearing, Pete went for a run and texted Violet, \"I went for a run. No matter what happens, I will always love you.\" Violet showed up for the hearing, but no one could find Pete. Violet got a call later from his phone. It was a police officer telling her something had happened to the owner of the phone and asking if she could come and identify him. It turned out that Pete had had a second heart attack and died on the side of the path and was lying there all day until someone found him.<ref>[[Aftershock]], x (PP)</ref>\ua\n\n\nPete could\uabe cold at times but had a loving heart. He was loyal to his wives even though he hated them at some point.\n\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|His first kiss with Addison.]]\nDuring Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery's first visit to Oceanside Wellness, Pete and Addison established a teasing and often flirtatious relationship. Addison initially labelled Pete a \ucquack,\ud but she allowed the \uccute hippy boy\ud to treat her with acupuncture. Although Pete was immediately attracted to her, he promised their mutual friend, Dr. Sam Bennett, that he would stay away from Addison. However, after finding Addison crying over her newly discovered infertility, Pete kissed her to prove that she wasn\ut \ucdried up.\ud Addison seemed open to pursuing a relationship with Pete, but was warned off by Sam. According to Sam, Pete is a serial monogamist, unable to emotionally connect with any woman since the death of his wife. Pete's last foray into office romance was apparently disastrous, and resulted in the unnamed OB/GYN's sudden departure from the practice. In response, Oceanside Wellness instituted a strict \"no consorting\" rule. Later, they got together again, after [[Violet Turner|Violet]] left Pete and [[Lucas Wilder|Lucas]] behind. They raised Lucas together for a while. They split up after Violet's return.\n\n[[Anna Wilder]]\nPete's relationship with his wife is somewhat mysterious and he appears reluctant to discuss their marriage. During a visit to her grave on the anniversary of her death, we discover Anna Wilder died in , at the age of . In a discussion regarding a patient, Pete hints to the other doctors that he stayed in an unhappy marriage because his wife was sick and that they were unable to make the marriage work. Pete eventually tells Addison that he went to bed with his wife on a Tuesday night and when he awoke the following Wednesday morning she was dead and that he thought she was ignoring him and argued with her dead body for  minutes before ripping the blankets of the bed and realizing that she had been dead. He further states that no night was perfect during their marriage, not even their wedding night. This information was the most that Pete has ever divulged to any of his co-workers about his wife. During a second visit to his wife's grave, Pete unleashes his pent-up anger to his wife's headstone. After stating that Anna was \"a mean, cold bitch\" and that he hated her, Pete softens and apologizes for not being able to save her. Pete later reveals to Violet that at the time of Anna's death they had been trying to conceive a child.\n\n[[Meg Porter]]\nPete and Meg met when they were both residents and later worked together as Doctors Without Borders. Meg reveals to Pete's surprised co-workers that once during the war in Bosnia, Pete refused to evacuate and, despite the mortar fire, stayed with sick children for the whole night, saving the lives of most of them. Later Pete told Meg, who has a smoking habit, that his wife was a smoker and she didn't quit the habit before she died. Despite their renewed relationship, Meg decides to come back to Ghana, where she works in malaria fighting program, but Pete asks her to come back to him, because she makes him happy. Despite that, Meg returned later to LA and even tried to give up smoking for Pete, the relationship didn't work. Meg wasn't sure if she wants to live in LA and Pete admitted that ever since his unhappy marriage he doesn't trust women anymore. When Pete and his Oceanside Wellness Group colleague [[Violet Turner|Violet]] hooked-up, the relationship with Meg was definitely over.\n\n[[Violet Turner]]\nThe relationship with Violet started with just sex, but later Pete realized that he wanted more. When he asked Violet if they could move to the next level and begin a real relationship, she turned him down, saying that she didn't trust him because of his past. But it was Violet's behavior that really caused the end of their relationship, when she started secretly dating Sheldon, the therapist from the rival practice, Pacific Wellcare. Pete ended their relationship because of Violet's infidelity. Afterward, Violet revealed to both Pete and Sheldon she was pregnant, and willing to raise the child, but ignored who the father was. Pete confronted Violet and said that he loved her and they could be a real family. Violet turned him down, but later she kissed him and told about her feelings towards him. In the end, Violet was kidnapped by her patient, [[Katie Kent|Katie]], who believed that Violet's baby was her own.\n\nPete found Violet lying unconscious on the floor of her house, bleeding to death. Katie cut the baby out of Violet and ran away with him. Pete saved Violet and together with Naomi rushed her to the hospital where Addison and Naomi operated on her. In the meantime, Katie appeared at the hospital with Violet's baby and was apprehended by Pete, Cooper, and security. While waiting in the hospital for Violet's surgery to be finished, Pete thought about their first meeting. They met just four days after Pete's wife's death, when Sam and Naomi, Pete's friends who just opened their private practice, recommended Violet to him as his therapist. Pete at first was reluctant to talk with Violet, but finally he opened to her and admitted that he hated his wife and argued with her all the time, even the night she died. The next morning, he was still yelling at her and only a few minutes later, he noticed that she wasn't answering because she was dead. Pete admitted that he was relieved after his wife's death and felt free. After that, Pete, who was the owner of an Infectious Diseases practice in Beverly Hills, decided to change his job, and started working in Oceanside Wellness Group as an Alternative Medicine specialist, where he still worked eight years later.\n\nA month after Lucas's traumatic birth, Violet was still trying to recover and get over her trauma. Pete lived with her and took care of her and Lucas. Violet was not leaving her house and had panic attacks every time the doorbell rang. After getting advice from Sheldon, Pete decided to move out, to help Violet recover and push her to go outside. Violet realized that after traumatic events in her life, she couldn't bond with her baby and gave Lucas to Pete, asking him to take care of the baby.\n\nA couple of weeks later, Sheldon requested a paternity test and it was revealed that Pete is the biological father.\n\nA few months later, Violet returned and wanted joint custody of Lucas. Pete didn't want to let this happen and battled her in court. Their relationship was strained for a while until Pete discovered that Violet had changed and that she was a good influence on Lucas and him.\uaAfter Dell's death, Pete and Violet decided to get married.\n\nAfter Pete had his first heart attack, he started to resent Violet, believing she was coddling him, and that resulted in their separation.\n\nWhen Violet started seeing Scott, Pete realized he was still in love with Violet.\n\nEventually, after Scott and Violet broke up, Violet also decided that she was still in love with Pete. Pete and Violet attempted to go to couples therapy, but Pete decided that they were in love and that was enough for him. Violet still wanted him to work, for them to work and sort out their problems.\n\nWhen Pete went out for his run, he texted Violet, telling her that he loved her. Concerned when Pete didn't show up for the hearing that he was meant to go to, she thought he had left. When she realized that Pete was dead, she told Cooper that Pete didn't look like Pete at all. According to her, Pete had always looked warm, even when he was angry, but now he just looked cold.\n\n[[Lisa King]]\nPete briefly dated Lisa after her son, [[Ben King]], one of Pete's patients, set them up. After realizing that he needed to be there for Violet and the baby, he showed up at Lisa's doorstep and broke things off with her.\n\n\nPete worked at the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]] as a [[Alternative Medicine|naturopathic doctor and licensed herbalist]]. He graduated from medical school and practiced traditional western medicine for a number of years before spending five years in China studying alternative medicine. Pete\us medical practice combines eastern and western medicine in an integrative approach, and he is often asked to provide expectant mothers with holistic birthing plans. Pete has also lectured locally and internationally on the subject of Oriental and Eastern Medicine. He used acupuncture on Addison during her first visit to the Oceanside Wellness Group and made her release negative energy.\n\nBefore Oceanside, Pete owned a practice in Beverly Hills which worked in [[Infectious Disease|infectious disease]]. Pete also had training in [[Critical Care Medicine|critical care]].\n\nPete was offered a job at Oceanside Wellness Group when the doctor they originally hired, a [[Dermatology|dermatologist]], was sued for inappropriately touching his patient's feet. However, [[Violet Turner|Violet]] had doubts as he was seeing her for therapy following the death of [[Anna Wilder|his wife]]. Eventually, Violet saw progress and allowed him to work at the practice.\n\nAfter some time at Oceanside, Pete accepted Naomi's offer and left the Oceanside Wellness Center to start working in [[Pacific Wellcare Center|Pacific Wellcare]]; additionally, he has picked up shifts at [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose Hospital's ER]], becoming employed as an [[Attending|attending]] critical care physician.\n\n\n*Before settling on the name Pete Wilder, the creators of the show considered and rejected \"Pete Finch\" and \"Pete Fisher.\"\n*Pete rode a Triumph motorcycle.<ref>[[Know When to Fold]], x (PP)</ref>\n*According to [[Sam Bennett|Sam]], Pete couldn't parallel park to save his life.<ref>[[Mourning Sickness]], x (PP)</ref>\n*Pete wanted a Balinese party instead of a normal funeral.<ref>[[Mourning Sickness]] x (PP)</ref>\n*Pete never ate the crust off his pizza.<ref>[[Mourning Sickness]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He loved mint chocolate chip ice cream.<ref>[[Mourning Sickness]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He liked meatloaf.<ref>[[Do the Right Thing]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He spoke Spanish.<ref>[[Playing God]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nPPPeteWilder.png\nPPxPeteWilder.png\nPPPeteWilder.png\nPPxPeteWilder.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Pete-centric or otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[In Which Addison Finds the Magic]]\n*[[A Death in the Family]]\n*[[War]]\n*[[Take Two]]\n*[[All in the Family]]\n*[[Can't Find My Way Back Home]]\n*[[The Hardest Part]]\n*[[God Laughs]]\n*[[And Then There Was One]]\n*[[True Colors (Private Practice)|True Colors]]\n*[[Gone, Baby, Gone]]\n*[[Mourning Sickness]]\n\n\n:'''Pete:''' My wife went to sleep beside me in bed on a Tuesday night, on Wednesday morning when I woke up, she was dead.

She wondered if she had gestational diabetes because Phillip was diabetic. Her brother-in-law, [[Malcolm]], who is a nurse, came to her appointment because Phillip had to work. Addison said that her blood sugar was fine. Addison listened to her lungs and had Dell call an ambulance because she heard fluid in Janine's lungs. She had diffuse myocardial dysfunction. The added pressure of the pregnancy caused the condition to worsen quickly. She needed a heart transplant. Because the pregnancy was putting extra stress on her, Addison recommended termination. Her husband said she should, but Janine said she couldn't do it.\n\nJanine was put at the top of the donor list, but her husband and brother-in-law were told she had only  hours to find a heart.\n\nPhillip later came into the ER with no brain activity. He'd had an insulin overdose that caused brain death. His license revealed that he was an organ donor. They talked to Janine, asking her to take Phillip's heart to save her life. Malcolm encouraged her to take it. They took her in for the surgery, but were stopped by [[Charlotte King]]. She believed it was either suicide or homicide and insisted that evidence be collected before the transplant could take place. They waited and Phillip started to become unstable, so they had to rush once they were cleared to retrieve the heart.\n\nAfter the transplant, Janine's condition improved, though she worried because she suspected that Malcolm might have killed his brother to get Janine a heart. She knew he was in love with her. Addison confronted Malcolm about it, but he denied it, saying he loved his brother. The ME ruled Phillip's death an accidental overdose.

Cooper examined her and said that she was fine, but noticed that Rachel was exhausted. He held Cynthia and told Rachel to rest for a minute. He asked Violet to come talk to her, but when they got back, Rachel was gone. They searched the practice and found her in a maternity suite. She talked about Cynthia's birth and said her husband named her, but she loves her. Cooper kept Cynthia and Violet talked to Rachel.\n\nAfter their talk, Violet suggested medication, but Rachel declined because she was breastfeeding, so Violet suggested acupuncture as an alternative. Pete talked about what he was going to do. Rachel talked rapidly to Pete about how Cynthia wasn't sleeping, which led to Pete going to Violet, telling her Rachel was manic. She already knew that. She believed Rachel had postpartum psychosis, so she talked to Rachel's husband and he agreed to pre-admit her to the hospital and come get the baby. While they were talking, Rachel came out of Pete's office with the acupuncture needles still in her face, believing that Cynthia was crying somewhere and trying to get to her. She found Cynthia with Cooper, getting ready to eat. Rachel panicked when they wouldn't let her have Cynthia. Rachel then confessed that she had held Cynthia under the water. She knew her husband wouldn't be home until dinner and no one would know and she could finally get some sleep. Violet sedated Rachel with benzos and started her on an antipsychotic.\n\nAndrew, her husband, came in and was shocked at what Rachel had done. He'd wondered what he'd missed or what he could have done. Pete and Violet reassured him that it wasn't his fault and there wasn't anything he could have done. Rachel woke up after a few hours of sleep and wanted to see Cynthia, leading Andrew to wonder what he should do.\n\nThe doctors discussed it. Violet believed Rachel was still a danger to Cynthia, but Cooper and Pete insisted that it'd be okay because she'd be monitored the whole time.\n\nThey brought Cynthia in to see Rachel. They handed her off to Andrew and told him to stay right there with her. Rachel held Cynthia and said she was sorry for what she had done.

Sheldon then witnessed Rachel slapping and then hitting Nick, who quickly subdued her and said she didn't mean to.\n\nSheldon went to Addison about it, who said she wasn't concerned about the abuse, which Sheldon said was resonant of rages that addicts have.\n\nSheldon visited Nick at home and said he had to report the abuse. Nick said he'd deny it if Sheldon said anything. Nick said that he could handle it.\n\nRachel came in and Addison examined her for possible causes for her rages. Her tests showed excess testosterone in her blood, which was caused by metastatic breast cancer. She'd had a mastectomy ten years prior, but leftover cells had caused the cancer to grow somewhere else. Addison said the only way to confirm was with surgery, which was risky for someone in her condition. Rachel said she wanted to do it for Nick.\n\nSheldon talked to Nick about what would happen going forward with Rachel and her treatment. Nick insisted that no matter what, he wouldn't leave Rachel because he loved her.\n\nIn surgery, Addison said the tumor was more invasive than she thought. She wasn't able to remove it all. Addison had to break the news to her that she was dying. Addison suggested testosterone-blocked agents, but said they aren't very effective.

Rachel said she was fine, but when pressed, she said that her husband, Shimmon, wasn't interested in having sex with her since Ruthie was born. She then said she didn't think Cooper could help and that it wasn't proper to talk to him about it.\n\nCooper went to Violet and Charlotte to talk about it. They brought in Rachel, who said that it had happened after previous births, but this one was persisting longer. When she talked about his other symptoms, Charlotte diagnosed couvade, his body mimicking her pregnancy symptoms. They suggested several options to get him back in the mood. However, she said that she didn't want that because while she loved her six kids, she couldn't raise or ask Shimmon to provide for any more than that. They also couldn't use birth control, so the couvade was a good way to keep them from having more kids. Violet and Charlotte suggested having Shimmon come in to talk about other options.\n\nBelieving he wouldn't talk to a woman, Cooper sat down with Shimmon and asked if he ever thought there'd be a point where he'd want to stop having kids. Shimmon replied that the Torah tells them to be fruitful and multiply to fill the earth. They interpreted it as doing nothing to stop a pregnancy from happening. He said he loves his wife and didn't want to stop being intimate with her. Cooper suggested other options that aren't birth control, but Shimmon said they'd chosen to be faithful and wouldn't fool God anyway.\n\nThey brought in a rabbi to get a religious perspective. He said that there were options, but the Golds sounded like they wanted to live by the letter of the law. The doctors then discussed other options. When they talked about what the pill has in it, Violet figured out a solution. They brought the Golds back in to tell them they had lots of options if they decided to use them. As they were leaving, Violet said that she believed Rachel might be anemic, common among young mothers. She gave her oral contraceptives to help, saying they contain iron. She said if she felt like she needed it, it would be up to her. Rachel took the pills and left with her husband and kids.\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Shimmon Gold]].

She later told Sam she believed Rick had let it happen, but Sam corrected that he didn't let it happen. She told the story of how they met and how she believed with him around, nothing bad would happen and knowing he'd been raped shattered that illusion. She didn't feel the same looking at him after knowing he'd been raped. Sam said that Rick had been injured in Afghanistan, like her father, and she needed to look at it that way.\n\nRick told Sheldon Kelly wasn't returning his calls and he believed she'd left him.

Violet said that them fighting was damaging Sarah and they needed to stop. Dana went to give Sarah the ice cream she'd gotten, but Sarah wasn't in her bed. Dana looked frantically around the ER for Sarah while Charlotte called a Code Pink.\n\nThey searched the hospital for Sarah while Ron and Dana waited. Violet gave Dana a sedative to calm her down, but Ron refused one, saying he wanted to stay clear. They found Sarah's raincoat on a bench outside the hospital and told her parents she wasn't anywhere in the hospital. She was officially missing. When morning came and Sarah was still gone, Violet came to the Nelsons and told them it was time to go home because there was nothing more they could do there. ''(\"[[You Don't Know What You've Got Till It's Gone]]\")''\n\n\nPeople gathered outside the hospital, including Ron and Dana, every day after Sarah disappeared. Search parties were launched twice every day. The film crew for Sam's pilot filmed their plea for their daughter's return. They were determined to find Sarah and be reunited as a family. ''(\"[[The Next Episode]]\")''\n\n\nRon and Dana continued to search for Sarah. Six weeks after her disappearance, they were seeing Violet about their grief. Dana was using sedatives to cope with the feelings. Violet suggested they start weaning her off the drugs, but Ron said it was the only way she could get through the day. Ron later called Violet when Dana crawled into Sarah's bed and wouldn't move. Violet said she didn't know where Sarah was or what would happen, but they needed to move forward instead of staying still. ''(\"[[The World According to Jake]]\")''\n\nIn a later session, Dana was upset because Ron had returned to work to pay the bills. She felt he was trying to move on and pretend they never had a daughter, but he said that the time he was at work was time he got to escape what was happening to them. He told Dana that Sarah was dead. He couldn't pretend to hope anymore. Dana said she knew that Sarah was still alive. Ron said he needed to believe she was dead because if she was alive, he couldn't cope with the things that must have happened to her. ''(\"[[I'm Fine]]\")''\n\n\nNinety-Five days after she went missing, Sarah was found in the basement of [[Nick Calhoun|Nick Calhoun's]] house. Sheldon carried her out of the house, where she was reunited with her parents. ''(\"[[I'm Fine]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Dana Nelson]]. They separated when Ron slept with his secretary and had a highly contentious relationship.\n\n\nHis daughter, Sarah, disappeared from the ER at [[St. Ambrose Hospital]]. After  days, she was found.

She and Kendra said they'd been together for six years and they were ready to have a baby. Evan was there to be the sperm donor. They wanted to use Rose's egg, but have Kendra carry so they could both be part of the experience. Jake consulted with them and then insisted that they sit down with Violet before proceeding because they were using a known donor, so that everyone would know what the expectations and limitations were.\n\nThey sat down with Violet, who asked Evan what he saw his role as. He said he'd donate the sperm, put together the crib, and then be the cool uncle. Violet questioned what would happen when the baby got a little older and he disagreed with a parenting decision. Her insistence on the truth pressed the three of them to admit that they were a polyamorous triad and planned to raise the baby together. Violet reminded them that they'd have to raise the child in the real world, which wouldn't be as accepting of their family as they were. They believed that they had enough love that they could it through.\n\nRose and Kendra went in to be examined before starting the process. Kendra's exam was unremarkable, but Rose was informed that she had uterine scarring and ovarian failure secondary to pelvic tuberculosis, making her completely infertile. However, Jake said that Kendra and Evan would not likely have trouble conceiving without assistance if they want. Rose quickly backed out of the pursuit for a baby, saying that they couldn't do it if they couldn't all be part of it.\n\nKendra and Evan saw Violet without Rose, saying they didn't understand the problem. Violet explained Rose's point of view on them sharing something she wasn't part of. They wanted to fix it, so Violet suggested a compromise.\n\nRose went to Jake asking if there was anything he could do to make her able to participate. He said that many women come to him unable to conceive and he still finds a way to make them mothers. She was worried a baby would change everything. He said that if the love were real, it could withstand anything, but admitted he didn't actually believe that. Love's powerful, but sometimes life wins.\n\nRose went to Kendra and Evan and said she wanted a baby, but not that way. Despite that, she said she loved them and agreed to trust them and have them conceive together. Evan agreed, but Kendra said she couldn't do it. She said the reason they worked was because of the rules. They needed unanimous to avoid someone getting hurt. She said they could have a baby another way, but given the choice, she chose the three of them. Evan said it wasn't trivial. He wanted a biological child and wasn't sure he could choose the relationship above that.\n\n\n\nShe's been seeing Kendra and Evan for six years.

He has written [[Body Language|a book]] and lives next door to [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. He has married\ua[[Naomi Bennett]]\uatwice, and they have a child together,\ua[[Maya Bennett]].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam is smart, funny, and can be very sexy at times. He has strong feelings, which helps with his bedside manner. He often gives inspirational speeches and talks about the meaning of life.\ua\n\n\n\n[[Naomi Bennett]]\nSam met Naomi in medical school at the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]]. The two married and had a daughter, [[Maya Bennett|Maya]]. Although the couple attempted to present the image of an amicably divorced couple, the post-marital relationship was, at times, strained. The reasons for their divorce were unclear. Sam professed to Addison that he had \"no good reason\" for requesting the divorce and then later stated that he was \"unhappy\" and wanted Naomi to fight for their relationship.\n\nSam and Naomi rekindled their sexual relationship after Sam survived a hostage situation. Although Sam and Naomi called the conference-room sex a \"slip up,\" they slept together again. For a brief time they were together again, but in the end they decided they should see other people.\ua\n\nSam and Naomi shared joint custody of Maya, although her primary residence was with Naomi.\n\nSam and Naomi began to repair their relationship after Naomi was asked to leave her post as director at the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]] and Sam began dating [[Sonya Nichols]], a doctor working for the County Health Department whom he met after a measles outbreak at the practice. Their relationship developed, and Maya also liked her. The first time they spent the night, Sam's asthma flared up and Sonya had to call an ambulance. Later on, they finally had sex, but not long into the relationship, Sam called Sonya \"Naomi\" while having sex, signalling he was not over her, which Addison hinted to while they were at Seattle Grace.\n\nThe two also shared a kiss while Naomi stayed over at Sam's house.\ua\n\nAt the wedding of mutual friend\ua[[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] to [[Jake Reilly]], the two had a one-night stand, resulting in Naomi's getting pregnant. Three months later, Naomi returned to L.A. where Sam, oblivious to the fact that Naomi was pregnant, declared his love for her and that he had always loved her. Naomi revealed her pregnancy to him and the two reunited and re-married.\ua\n\n[[Sonya Nichols]]\nSam began dating Sonya, a doctor working for the County Health Department whom he met after a measles outbreak at the practice. After Sonya finished evaluating the practice after a measles case came through, she admitted to Sam that she'd spent the whole day thinking about how his lips might taste like chocolate and she couldn't look at them. They then shared a kiss and later went out dancing together. Their relationship developed, and Maya also liked her. The first time they spent the night, Sam's asthma flared up and Sonya had to call an ambulance. Later on, they finally had sex, but not long into the relationship. After Sam went to Seattle to be with Archer and Naomi, Sonya questioned him about why he went and he said he went to support Naomi because she doesn't always have it all together. They continued to see each other happily until Sam called Sonya by the name of [[Naomi Bennett|Naomi]], signaling he was not over her.\n\nThey fought over it and Sam insisted that he wasn't thinking about Naomi while they were having sex. Despite this, she refused him sex. Sam tried to mend fences by getting Naomi's help to plan a vacation. Their vacation went well, but Naomi said afterward that she was done helping him with Sonya. Sonya came to him about a date and he admitted that you don't call out your ex's name if your new relationship is working. He ended things with her.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nSam and Addison were friends since Med school. In med school, he had asked her out, but she turned him down due to Naomi liking him.\n\nWhen Addison moved to L.A., she learned that they lived next door to each other.\n\nThey embarked on a relationship after Addison had lived in L.A. for some time. Their on-off relationship was marred by trouble and eventually ended due to Sam's unwillingness to have any more children.\ua\n\nShortly after Addison got [[Henry Montgomery|Henry]], Sam proposed to Addison, despite her being involved with [[Jake Reilly|Jake]]. However, the two managed to remain close friends and colleagues. Sam later attended her wedding to Jake, wishing only for her happiness, and reunited with Addison's best friend and his ex-wife, Naomi.\n\n[[Stephanie Kemp]]\nSam began dating Stephanie shortly after he broke up with Addison for the final time when she turned down his proposal. At first, he didn't tell Stephanie about his past with Addison or Naomi, creating a rift in their relationship. They got past it when he said he chose to care about her.\n\nStephanie met Naomi at Addison and Jake's wedding. Sam left her shortly thereafter for Naomi, breaking Stephanie's heart. She said that she really thought that he was \"the one\".\n\n\n[[Maya Bennett]]\nMaya Bennett\uais the daughter of Sam\uaand\ua[[Naomi Bennett]]. Her god-mother is Addison Montgomery.\ua\n\nMaya enjoys a close relationship with both of her parents. Although her parents divorced, the divorce didn't upset Maya much with Naomi once commenting that she probably enjoyed having 'extra everything'.\ua\n\nAt age fifteen, Maya found out she is pregnant by her boyfriend [[Fillmore Davis|Dink]], which angered both Sam and Naomi. While Naomi pushed for her daughter to have an abortion, Sam maintained the more rational stance, putting his daughter's wellbeing above all.\n\nMuch to Naomi's chagrin, Maya and Dink decided to keep the baby. Maya and Dink wanted to raise their baby together. At this, Naomi shunned her daughter, leaving Sam to care for a pregnant Maya. Maya and Dink decided they wanted to get married and went to Sam for help. Sam and Dink's mother started talking and finally gave their consent.\ua\n\nSam walked his daughter down the aisle and was eventually present for the birth of his granddaughter, [[Olivia Davis|Olivia]].\ua\n\n\n[[Cooper Freedman]]\n[[Charlotte King]]\n[[Violet Turner]]\n[[Pete Wilder]]\nSam and Pete were friends for a long time. Sam is one of a few people who knew Pete's first wife. They occasionally walked along the pier and consulted on each other's problems.\n\n\nDr. Sam Bennett, or \"Doctor Feelgood\" as he's known to patients across the globe, is another founding partner of the Oceanside Wellness Group and the practice's internist. He is the author of the best-selling non-fiction book, ''[[Body Language|Body Language: The Mind-Body Connection]]''. Oceanside Wellness Group, with its co-operative and whole-body approach to medicine, is illustrative of the views advocated in the book.\n\nWith Addison, Sam relieved Naomi of her administrative duties at Oceanside Wellness upon learning that the practice was going bankrupt. He took over, and introduced a \"Board of Shame\" (as Violet called it).\n\nEventually, all of the staff members had had enough of Sam's methods of increasing business at the practice, prompting a vote between Sam and Naomi, which, to the surprise of both Sam and Naomi, Addison won.\n\nIt is revealed when [[Miranda Bailey]] visits LA that Sam has completed a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Resident|residency]]. Reasons as to why Sam became an [[Internal Medicine|internist]] instead of a cardiothoracic surgeon remained unknown until he was confronted with [[Dell Parker|Dell's]] murderer and the man who hit [[Maya Bennett|Maya]] with his car. He let a pedophile die on the table by doing nothing to resuscitate him, causing him to feel guilty. He often practices his cardiothoracic specialty at [[St. Ambrose Hospital|the hospital]]\uaand refers to himself as one of the best cardiothoracic surgeons in the country.\ua\n\n\n*Sam can't ride a bike.<ref>[[Know When to Fold]], x (PP)</ref>\n*He used to have a dog named [[Thurgood Marshall]].\n*He doesn't like to wear condoms.\n*He is Catholic.\n*Sam and [[Cooper Freedman|Cooper]] are the only characters that appeared in every episode of\ua''[[Private Practice]]''.

A kidney finally became available for her after three years of dialysis. While she was having dialysis before her transplant, [[Izzie Stevens]], distracted by a fight with [[Charles Percy]] ordered the wrong solution and sucked all the potassium out of her body. She survived, but wasn't able to get her kidney. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nDesperate to save Sarah's life, Bailey flew Sarah down to Los Angeles to receive a kidney from her sister, [[Emily]]. Emily couldn't travel to Seattle because she had three small children and her ex-husband is abusive. Emily had been tested as a partial match three years prior. At the time, that wasn't good enough, but since Sarah's condition had declined, they decided to use it. Emily tried to get them to skip the pre-operative tests, but Bailey said they needed to let her rest and get assurances that Sarah was strong enough for the transplant. During the testing, they discovered that Emily was infected with HIV. She was aware of that and hoped they'd still be able to do the transplant because Sarah had no other option. She said she'd rather get AIDS than die. Because of the anti-rejection drugs she'd have to take for the kidney, the doctors believed she had the potential to develop full-blown AIDS quickly.\n\nWhen Sarah's organs started shutting down, Bailey appealed to Charlotte to do the transplant with Emily's kidney. Charlotte agreed to try to get a team together. Once the team was put together, Bailey asked them all again if they were sure they were willing to participate. [[Tommy (Right Here, Right Now)|One member]] of the team backed out. Without him, Charlotte said the surgery couldn't go on. However, Sam stepped in, saying he'd done a surgical residency, and he'd take the open place.\n\nThe surgery went on and Sarah went into pericardial tamponade. Sam did a pericardiocentesis to relieve the pressure, which was successful, allowing them to complete the transplant. ''(\"[[Right Here, Right Now]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe is very close to her sister, Emily. When Emily ended up in an abusive marriage, Sarah flew out to her home and stayed for six months, making sure Emily and her daughters were safe.

When the parents came back to ER, Cooper was waiting for them and he asked where their daughter was.

Shabbat said they had talked and asked Addison again for the surgery. She said she loves her parents and just wanted to take them home.

Naomi said she looked good for implantation, but had concerns about it. Sharon insisted that it wasn't about grief. It was her just honoring her daughter's wishes. When Naomi talked to Violet about the idea, Violet strongly opposed it, saying that Terri, who had been her patient, hated her mother.\n\nSharon had an evaluation with Violet and admitted that she knew that Terri hated her. She loved her work and when she got pregnant, people told her she'd love that, too, but it was hard and she didn't enjoy it as much because she felt overwhelmed and inadequate.

Cooper examined her and said she was perfectly healthy. He asked Rachel how she was doing, because Ruthie had six kids under the age of eight. Rachel said she was fine, but when pressed, she said that Shimmon wasn't interested in having sex with her since Ruthie was born. She then said she didn't think Cooper could help and that it wasn't proper to talk to him about it.\n\nCooper went to Violet and Charlotte to talk about it. They brought in Rachel, who said that it had happened after previous births, but this one was persisting longer. When she talked about his other symptoms, Charlotte diagnosed couvade, his body mimicking her pregnancy symptoms. They suggested several options to get him back in the mood. However, she said that she didn't want that because while she loved her six kids, she couldn't raise or ask Shimmon to provide for any more than that. They also couldn't use birth control, so the couvade was a good way to keep them from having more kids. Violet and Charlotte suggested having Shimmon come in to talk about other options.\n\nBelieving he wouldn't talk to a woman, Cooper sat down with Shimmon and asked if he ever thought there'd be a point where he'd want to stop having kids. Shimmon replied that the Torah tells them to be fruitful and multiply to fill the earth. They interpreted it as doing nothing to stop a pregnancy from happening. He said he loves his wife and didn't want to stop being intimate with her. Cooper suggested other options that aren't birth control, but Shimmon said they'd chosen to be faithful and wouldn't fool God anyway.\n\nThey brought in a rabbi to get a religious perspective. He said that there were options, but the Golds sounded like they wanted to live by the letter of the law. The doctors then discussed other options. When they talked about what the pill has in it, Violet figured out a solution. They brought the Golds back in to tell them they had lots of options if they decided to use them. As they were leaving, Violet said that she believed Rachel might be anemic, common among young mothers. She gave her oral contraceptives to help, saying they contain iron.

Shira begged her not to let the baby be born, but Addison was forced to deliver him in the ambulance because they couldn't stop her contractions.

Addison recommended reducing the pregnancy to one, but Angie and Simon opposed the idea.\n\nThe McConnells called in [[Vanessa Hoyt]] as a consult and she believed that it was safe for Kayla to continue the pregnancy as triplets.\n\nSam agreed to do the surgery on Kayla. It was successful.\n\nKayla was stable for a while after the surgery, but then she started forming clots above the umbrella. Addison rushed her into surgery to reduce the pregnancy load. Before she could do that, Kayla started throwing more clots and they needed to close and move her to ICU. Her heart stopped when a clot moved to her lung. There was no evidence of higher brain function and she was put on life support. The McConnells asked about the baby that was left and were told that the reduction hadn't been performed. As long as Kayla was on the ventilator, the babies would continue to grow. ''(\"[[Triangles]]\")''\n\nAs Kayla was in a coma, Eddie decided he wanted to turn the machines off, believing Kayla wouldn't want to live like that. Vanessa, opposing the decision, went to Simon and Angie and told them about it. They believed Kayla would want them to continue life support until the babies were born. Eddie still insisted he just wanted Kayla to have peace. The McConnells got a lawyer to prevent him from turning off the machines. Only essential medical personnel were allowed in Kayla's room while they waited for a judge to rule on what would happen.\n\nEddie waited outside Kayla's room in the hallway. He called some lawyers, but couldn't afford any of them. [[Charlotte King]] gave him the name of a lawyer at a non-profit aid group and encouraged him to call.\n\nThe judge came in and ruled that Kayla's life would have to continue until viability had been reached. She also ordered that her room continued to be closed to all but essential medical personnel.\n\nCharlotte later saw Eddie waiting outside Kayla's room, so she left the door unlocked and told him the nurse was on break. He went into her room and locked the door. He then disconnected her ventilator. They broke a window to get into the room, but before they could reconnect the ventilator, they saw that Kayla was breathing on her own. ''(\"[[Pulling the Plug]]\")''\n\nAfter six weeks in a coma, Eddie called in [[Geraldine Ginsberg]] to try to wake Kayla up. After she ran tests and examined Kayla, Ginsberg believed nothing could be done. However, [[Amelia Shepherd]], who was on Ginsberg's team, had an idea. Ginsberg believed it wouldn't work, so she refused to do it. When Ginsberg fired Amelia, she stayed to help Kayla. After speaking with Eddie, Amelia agreed to do the surgery.\n\nAfter hearing about what Amelia had planned, the McConnells asked her not to operate, to give them a little more time so the babies could mature more. Despite this, she operated. During the surgery, the three babies had to be delivered, but Amelia was then able to finish the procedure.\n\nAfter surgery, Kayla's reflexes started to re-emerge and she woke up.

She knew he was leaving her for Naomi, whom she said she actually liked when she met her. ''(\"[[In Which We Say Goodbye]]\")''\n\nJosh\nShe had a past boyfriend named Josh whom she lived with.

Pete called in Addison, who did an ultrasound. She'd had chronic pain for the last five years, but no one had been able to find any cause. The baby was fine, but Addison believed the pregnancy was exasperating her condition. Pete believed she had fibromyalgia. They couldn't use meds because it was dangerous for the baby and they didn't have time for alternative methods to work.\n\nHer pain worsened and she asked for something to help with the pain. She was told she couldn't have anything because anything strong enough to help would hurt the baby. She asked about delivering the baby, but she hadn't yet reached viability. She said that if they couldn't help, she couldn't continue the pregnancy.\n\nSteven begged them not to let her terminate. She didn't want a kid in the first place, but he pushed her and now he can't touch her because of the pain, so he'd never felt the baby kick, but he was excited about the baby.\n\nWhen Amelia overheard Pete and Addison discussing her case, she told them to run an MRI. The MRI showed a chiari malformation. It put pressure on her brain, causing her pain. Amelia said she could operate. Pete opposed surgery, suggesting alternative methods.\n\nThey went to the Stones with their plans and Elena decided she wanted the surgery after Addison said she recommended it.\n\nThey operated and Elena and the baby were both stable afterward. When she woke up, she had a headache, but was otherwise pain-free. Steven was able to feel the baby kick for the first time.\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Elena Stone]].

Sam called an ambulance and had the paramedics take Stevie and Gloria along with Dave to the hospital, worried about leaving Gloria in charge of Stevie. In the ER, Dave was quickly discharged at his own request. Later, Stevie came to the practice with the same symptoms of his father. Suspicious, Sam ran tests and found coprine in Stevie's blood, a natural antabuse from ink cap mushrooms. He deduced that Gloria had been feeding them to Dave to get him to stop drinking, because drinking made him violently ill after consuming the mushrooms. Sam spoke to Gloria privately, trying to convince her to stop, but she was unwilling to do so because she knew she didn't have much time left to live and didn't want her son to keep drinking, as she knew he would end up dead.

Bizzy slapped Addison and commanded Addison to save Susan's life. Addison called in [[Eric Rodriguez]] and asked for his professional advice. He agreed that there was nothing there could do, but agreed to do some research and consult with colleagues. He suggested that Addison scope her. When Addison did the scope, she saw that the tumor had spread to her liver. She suggested not doing anything, but Bizzy kept pushing, so Addison suggested using the [[Da Vinci Surgical System]] to get angles she couldn't get with her own hands. Susan agreed to try it for Bizzy. Addison brought Eric in on the surgery to use hot chemo to kill the cancer cells left behind. They were able to remove the cancer and place her port for chemo.

When Addison went to check to see if Susan was dressed for the wedding, she discovered that Susan wasn't better.

Addison asked if she had anyone else helping, because she was so young herself.

Danielle said she had given him cold medicine, but it hadn't helped. Addison said he had a fever and called Cooper over to look at him. Cooper found a large rash on his belly and said that they needed to go back to the practice for an EKG. The EKG revealed aneurysms in the blood vessels leading to his heart, indicating Kawasaki syndrome. Cooper said they could treat with immunoglobulin, but because Elliot and Danielle were homeless, Sam suggested a bypass procedure as a more permanent solution. To help, Addison suggested that they try to find Danielle's mom.\n\nElliot was admitted to the hospital for treatment. Danielle was worried about getting back to the shelter by eight, but Sam said she could stay in the room with Elliot. Addison located Danielle's mom and said she was on her way to the hospital. Susanna came and said that she'd looked for Danielle, but couldn't find her. She said that Danielle could come home, but Danielle said that her mother had driven her to an abortion clinic and when she wouldn't do it, told her she had to give the baby up for adoption. When Susanna wouldn't leave, Danielle said she would and took Elliot and left.\n\nCooper and Addison went out to look for them and found Danielle trying to stop Elliot from crying.

Tammy's arm was broken when her father threw her across the room and Michelle was beaten. However, Darren's injuries were the most severe. Michelle had stabbed him nine times.

He said that people wanted to help her and she could talk about it later. She was worried about her dad.\n\nSam examined Darren and ordered a head CT. Darren asked if he'd be okay and asked about Michelle and Tammy. Sam told him it was a little late to be worried about them.\n\nSince Michelle was pregnant, Addison did an ultrasound and said that the baby looked fine for ten weeks. She then asked Michelle if Darren hitting her and Tammy happened often. Michelle said it was an accident and asked to see Tammy. Addison asked again about the attack. Michelle said it wasn't like that. She said she was cooking. She and Darren started arguing and Tammy got in the way, so Darren pushed her. She got mad, overreacted, and stabbed him. As Addison took her to see Tammy, police officers showed up at the hospital to arrest Michelle. Addison said she needed medical care, so they told Addison to admit her to the jail ward and handcuffed her.\n\nMichelle and Darren had conceived with assistance from Naomi because they wanted a sibling for Tammy.\n\nDarren continued to insist to Sam that it was an accident. Darren had a seizure due to a brain contusion, which caused swelling in his brain. Sam put him in a drug-induced coma. They gave him mannitol to try to reduce the swelling in his brain.\n\nMichelle maintained that Darren wasn't abusive, even when Addison advised her that she could go to jail if Darren died.\n\nCooper talked to Tammy about her dad being in a coma. He asked her to talk about what happened because her mom wasn't talking. He wanted her to tell the truth about what happened. She admitted that she was supposed to say it was an accident, but it wasn't. She was cutting a cantaloupe. Her dad came in and was being silly, singing along with the radio, but she got mad. She just gets so mad sometimes. Her dad could see that was happening. He held her to try to calm her down, but she bit him. He called for her mom, but Tammy still had the knife in her hand and stabbed him. And she was upset because he was going to die.\n\nWhen Michelle was released from custody, she realized that meant that Tammy told the truth about what had happened. She believed it was her fault because she'd used drugs during her pregnancy with Tammy. Tammy had ADHD and then the rages started. Her school counselor said it was just adolescence, but Michelle was convinced it was her fault, because the test hadn't showed any other cause. She said Darren was the strong one and she needed him, but he was in a coma and she was worried Tammy would be taken away.\n\nWhen juvenile officers came to take Tammy, Cooper asked to keep Tammy in the hospital for longer. He went to Tammy's room and found her in a rage, attacking a nurse. He restrained her an ordered lorazepam to calm her down.\n\nThe next day, Cooper consulted with Addison.

She said she loved Ty, but she was having a baby. She told Violet she believed she was up for it, but Violet asked if she knew what it would be like to see that baby every day, to remember being raped every day.

Cooper examined him and heard a heart murmur, so he told Tyler and his parents he wanted him to get checked out by Sam. They wanted to get it done today and needed Cooper to sign a medical release saying that Tyler could wrestle again.\n\nSam diagnosed Tyler with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but said he could still wrestle. There were risks, but there was a chance he could do it without any problems. Despite his recommendation, Cooper said he couldn't allow Tyler to wrestle.\n\nTyler came to Cooper and said his mom had gotten laid of and his dad was working double shifts to pay the rent. He worked a part-time job on the weekends to help out. Wrestling was his way to get to college. Cooper just said he couldn't risk it and had scheduled a cardiac MRI for Tyler.\n\nTyler's dad, Randy, came into the hospital, saying he understood how important getting the MRI was. He was surprised that Tyler hadn't arrived because his mother had said she'd bring him.

He said that the medical release had been signed, but Stacy had forged it. Tyler won his match, but shortly after, went into cardiac arrest. They rushed him to the hospital, where they were able to restart his heart, but he was deprived of oxygen long enough that there was the potential for brain damage.

During a routine exam, Sam saw that her glands were swollen, so he did a biopsy. The biopsy revealed Burkitt's lymphoma. Because it was so aggressive, they suggested getting her to the hospital immediately for more testing. The type of cancer she had made chemotherapy her only option, but she couldn't start treatment while she was pregnant. She didn't have time to wait until she reached full term in her pregnancy, so Addison suggested delivering the baby immediately. Gary wanted to deliver and start treatment, but Val said with all the past miscarriages, she wanted to carry the baby to term, even if it killed her.\n\nVal was admitted to the hospital for testing. She told Addison that Gary said he could deal with being with a career woman, but no kids would be a deal breaker for him. When Addison pushed a little more, Val admitted she'd had an abortion early in their marriage without telling Gary. While talking to Addison, Val started to have trouble breathing, so Addison gave her oxygen.\n\nEven though her condition was deteriorating and she had a problem with her heart, Val continued to insist that she didn't want to start treatment yet. Gary said he wanted to be a parent, but not without her. Val admitted that she'd had an abortion. He was upset and left the room.\n\nDespite his anger, Gary stayed in the waiting room because he couldn't leave. Addison spoke to him and convinced him to tell Val to have the c-section.

She proposed a procedure that would allow Kayla to continue the pregnancy. The procedure was done, but it didn't help and Kayla was left in a coma when she started throwing clots during a second surgery. ''(\"[[Triangles]]\")''\n\nKayla remained on life support. Her husband decided he wanted to remove life support and let Kayla have peace, but Vanessa and the McConnells opposed the decision because she was still pregnant with the McConnells' triplets. A judge ruled that Kayla had to remain on life support and her room was restricted to medical personnel. However, Eddie, with help from Charlotte King, ended up in her room alone and disconnected her ventilator. To the doctors' shock, Kayla started breathing on her own. ''(\"[[Pulling the Plug]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Geraldine Ginsberg]] was brought in to look on Kayla's case, her fellow, [[Amelia Shepherd]] believed she could help Kayla even when Ginsberg felt it was hopeless. Vanessa asked Amelia not to do the surgery she planned because the fetuses were near viability. She did the surgery despite this request and during the surgery, the three babies had to be delivered and taken to the NICU.

She was married to [[Pete Wilder]] until his death and together they have a son, [[Lucas Wilder|Lucas]].\n\n\n\nDuring her freshman year of college, Violet was raped when a man broke into her dorm and helped through it by her best friend [[Kara Wei]], Violet helped Kara through her problem of accidentally killing her abusive mother.<ref>[[Let It Go]], x (PP)</ref> Violet takes offense to women who lie about being raped,<ref>[[Past Tense]], x (PP)</ref> and when confronted about an almost conversation between her and Addison; Violet says that it's something that she wasn't going to talk about it, that \"it is what it is.\"\n\nThe rest of her college years were a dark time for her. She slept with three of her college professors, one of whom may have been a woman, as exploring her sexual boundaries was a way for her to take back her sexuality.<ref>[[The World According to Jake]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nOne of Violet's schizophrenic patients, [[Katie Kent|Katie]], who was pregnant but miscarried. She refused to let anyone perform a D&C to remove the dead tissue. After talking to Violet and Dell, she finally realized that her baby was dead. She allowed the doctors to perform a D&C.<ref>[[What Women Want]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nLater, Katie came to visit Violet at her house. She told her that Violet had her baby and that she wanted it back. Katie proceeded to inject her with a drug that left Violet paralyzed from the neck\uadown and began to lay out surgical instruments and a medical textbook to perform a c-section, all the while talking about how Violet's baby died so Violet took Katie's. Violet tried to coach Katie out of it, saying that Violet's baby was a boy, while Katie's a girl. She said that she believed Katie and that they both love the baby, and if Katie would begin to cut, the baby might get hurt. Then, the baby kicked, which Katie thought was a calling and became even more convinced to start. Violet asked her if they could wait, and Katie knocked her out as a result. Cooper came to the house, but was interrupted by a call and left, despite Violet's gagged attempts to call his name. Katie began to place the scalpel on Violet's abdomen, but Violet said that she was placing the scalpel too high, and began to instruct her through the c-section.<ref>[[Yours, Mine & Ours]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nShe was later found by Pete and Naomi, who called . She was brought to St. Ambrose, where Addison operated on her. In the operating room, Dell began to talk to her, despite knowing that she was unable to hear him. They contemplated removing her uterus, but Cooper said that wouldn't be what Violet wanted, though he later contradicted that when they found Violet's baby. Soon after, Violet began to crash, though Naomi was able to save her. After she got out of surgery, she chose the baby's name, Lucas.<ref>[[A Death in the Family]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nShe was later released from the hospital and went home with Pete and Lucas. She had trouble connecting to Lucas, leaving most of the primary care and parenting to Pete. She also had a new-found fear of answering the door, usually hiding in the closet whenever someone knocked or rang the doorbell. She assured Pete that she was fine and that he could go back to work, but he was skeptical.<ref>[[The Way We Were]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\nAfter she had recovered from the attack, Violet tried for a while to take care of [[Lucas Wilder|Lucas]]. However, she came to the conclusion that she couldn't take care of him and that she had to take care of herself before she could do that for her son. Violet left Lucas with\ua[[Pete Wilder|Pete]], his father. Sometime after that, she left the practice while on a trip with [[Cooper Freedman|Cooper]]. She stayed for a while in Costa Rica and New York. In New York, she sought professional help from a colleague to handle her trauma. Later she returned to LA where she told Pete that she wanted to be a part of Lucas' life. Pete was hesitant at first, but ultimately Violet got to know Lucas.\n\n\nWhile healing from the attack, Violet found consolation in writing. She wrote an -page memoir about the specifics of her life, including working at the practice and her attack. One of her friends pushed her to publish it, and after gaining the support of her friends at the practice, she ended up publishing the book and titling it \"Beautiful Scars.\" \n\nHer attacker, [[Katie Kent]], filed a lawsuit against her claiming that it breached doctor-patient confidentiality and affected her healing process. Despite the restraining order against Katie, Violet visited Katie at the restaurant she worked at and tried to convince her to drop the charges. Katie then visited Violet's office that night trying to apologize for all the pain and trauma she caused and dropped the charges.\n\nFollowing the lawsuit, the medical board opened an investigation regarding Violet's medical license. After a few interviews, they chose to suspend her license. They also started coming after [[Oceanside Wellness Group]] for the same concerns - breaching doctor-patient confidentiality. While this was all happening, Violet decided to go on a book tour for a couple of weeks, causing a strain in her marriage with Pete.\n\n\n\n\nViolet is very patient and optimistic. She is shown as a great person to talk to and will help when someone is in a bind.\n\nViolet tells her patients that happiness can be attained with focus, but she has trouble finding happiness in her own life, even going so far as to question the usefulness of her profession.\n\n\n\n[[Allan]]\nSix months prior to when Addison first arrived at their Oceanside Wellness Group, Violet's boyfriend, Allan, had split up with her and she was torn by the break-up. As she started to heal, she ran into Allan in a supermarket to discover that he'd gotten married to a younger woman only a few months after their break-up. Violet was shaken badly and even went as far as \"stalking\" Allan with constant calls as she tried to deal with him moving on while she kept trying to. She and Allan tried to be friends but Violet realized she was only hurting herself and cut off all contact.<ref>[[In Which Addison Finds a Showerhead]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n[[Sheldon Wallace]]\nViolet decided she wanted to sleep with both Pete and Sheldon. When she got pregnant, she didn't know who the father was and freaked out. The men agreed to a paternity test, but she didn't do so for the remainder of the pregnancy nobody knew who the father was. Sheldon was also in love with Violet at this point, as was Pete, and Violet didn't know who to choose.\n\n[[Pete Wilder]]\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Pete kisses Violet.]]\nWhile she was pregnant with her son Lucas she was unaware who the father was. It could have been either [[Pete Wilder]] or [[Sheldon Wallace]], although she had expressed an intention of keeping the baby and having [[Cooper Freedman|Cooper]] move in with her.\n\nAs Pete's relationship grew more serious with Lisa, he told her about Violet's baby. She asked him to figure out what he wanted and eventually, he decided to leave her and tell Violet but before he informed Violet, Sheldon proposed to her. Violet didn't answer straight away, Pete instead tells Violet he should have fought for her and loves her, and she chooses Pete over Sheldon.\n\nAfter Lucas was ripped from her womb by Katie<ref>[[Yours, Mine & Ours]], x (PP)</ref>, she didn't feel anything toward him and even though Pete (the father) tried and tried to get her to bond with him, she eventually gave him up to Pete. After she slept with Addison's father, Pete gave up on her.\n\nAfter a few months, Violet returned from her trip from Costa Rica healthy<ref>[[Second Choices]], x (PP)</ref> and she sued for partial custody of Lucas.<ref>[[War]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nShe and Pete got back together and quickly got married.<ref>[[Take Two]], x (PP)</ref> They fought when she wanted to adopt [[Betsey Parker|Betsey]].<ref>[[A Better Place to Be]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAfter her license was suspended, she ran to do a book tour, missing him having a heart attack. She got back from the airport as he was in surgery. It was after months of arguing and remaining together that they decided to separate.\n\nAfter they had both dated other people and took a small break from their marriage they soon realized that they still had feelings for one another. Violet decided that they needed to go to counseling to find out what the problem was but Pete just wanted to \"have fun\" and enjoy the fact that they were okay. They went to a few counseling sessions but Pete stormed out of one and refused to go to another one. He began working a lot and he became very reckless even landing himself in jail for taking a patient off of life support to respect his undocumented wishes. After Violet begged him to cooperate with the court for bail Pete was set free but was on trial for what he had done. After being together one night Violet asked him what would happen if he was taken back to jail. The next day Violet receives a text message from Pete saying that he went on a run and that whatever happened he loved her. Pete ends up being absent from his court hearing that morning and Violet had many doubts about his whereabouts assuming that he ran away from it all. Eventually, they found Pete's body in the ditch of a canyon dead from a heart attack.<ref>[[Aftershock]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n[[\"The Captain\" Montgomery]]\nViolet slept with The Captain while he was visiting Addison. While they had sex, she became embarassed about her scar, though The Captain said that it was a reminder that she survived something and she should do whatever she wanted to do for a while.<ref>[[The Parent Trap]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n[[Scott Becker]]\nWhen Violet calmed down an angry patient in the emergency room, Scott Becker, a paramedic, asked her out. She turned him down at first but after she saw that Pete was moving on, she agreed to go on a date with him, and it went well.<ref>[[The Standing Eight Count]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nHe spent the night, but Violet said she wasn't able to have sex with him. After Violet was punched by a patient's husband, she found Scott and he said that he was there for her after he treated her.<ref>[[Losing Battles]], x (PP)</ref> Later, after being confronted by Pete about their relationship, Violet decieded to have sex with Scott.<ref>[[The Time Has Come]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nScott later wanted for the relationship to progress, which meant to him meeting Lucas and Violet's friends. She told him that her life was complicated and that Scott made her feel good, helping her forget everything else in her life. All she wanted was detached, mind-numbing sex, which Scott agreed to.<ref>[[You Break My Heart]], x (PP)</ref>\n\nAfter Scott got injured following an attack, he asked for Violet, who came to the hospital and attempted, at first, to reduce his shoulder with Pete. She wasn't able to apply enough pressure until Pete encouraged her to trust him. Scott later told her that he saw how they talked with each other and they deserved to be a family, effectively breaking up with her.<ref>[[The Letting Go]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n\n[[Cooper Freedman]]\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Cooper and Violet, best friends.]]\nWhen she joined the [[Oceanside Wellness Group]], Cooper became her best friend.\n\nIt became a tradition that every year when they received their bonuses, they would take a holiday together. Violet became concerned when Cooper didn't want to go on their annual trip, and their relationship was strained when she figured out that Cooper was sleeping with Charlotte King.\n\nDuring her pregnancy, she had Cooper to run errands for her, including tying her shoes because she couldn't see her feet. Unexpectedly, Charlotte and Violet began to bond over Cooper and Charlotte did the girly things that Cooper could not, as well as helping Violet with her pregnancy symptoms.\n\n[[Kara Wei]]\n[[File:PPx-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Kara and Violet hug.]]\nViolet met Kara in college and the two became best friends. When Violet was raped, Kara helped her through it, but Kara never told her of the abuse she went through as a child.\n\nKara and Violet met again when Kara was running for congress. She explained to Violet how she was depressed after the abuse she went through as a child, so she went through shock theraphy. She wanted that file destroyed since she was concerned that it would ruin her career if a reporter got a hold of it.\n\nThey later had lunch together. and Violet told Kara that she shouldn't hide from her past. She had an opportunity to be good, to embrace what happened to her and go public with the shock therapy. Kara was enraged and said Violet that she didn't go public with her rape and that she was with Violet every step of the way as she buried it. Violet said that it was different and mental illness was nothing to be ashamed of, and that it could help lots of people if they knew that there was no shame in talking about that.\n\nTheir friendship ended when Violet gave her an ultimatum: to choose her friendship or her career, and choose the person she was or the person she wanted to be.

One day Violet asked Addison if she wanted to come to lunch with her and Lucas. She and Addison started talking and complaining to each other and started to help each other get through their unrealistic amount of drama. Then Addison asked if they should be friends and Violet said yes. From then on Addison and Violet would go out for coffee (or tea in Violet's case) and walk into each other's offices unannounced to tell each other about their issues. Addison figured out what she needed to do about her relationship with Sam and Violet figured out what to do about her relationship with Pete with help from one another. Eventually they grew to be really good friends who helped each other through a lot.\n\n[[Naomi Bennett]]\nShe was a very good friend to Naomi, but when [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] joined the practice, Naomi forgot about her and started talking to Addison like she did with Violet, instead, casting Violet aside.\n\n\nViolet attended the University of Oregon, and pursued medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]].\n\nDr. Violet Turner is a [[Board Certification|board certified]] [[Board Certification#American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology|psychiatrist]] specializing in general adult and adolescent psychotherapy, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of pharmacological medication.

Although she wanted to keep her baby, her mother did not allow it, and her baby was given up to a Catholic family.\n\nAfter a long career and having devoted her life to medicine, she eventually retired and moved to California some time after she was diagnosed with gastric cancer. She eventually was hired by UCLA as part of their guest lecturer series.\n\nIn , when she began to experience abdominal discomfort, she was admitted to [[St. Ambrose Hospital|St. Ambrose Hospital's]] [[Emergency Medicine|emergency medicine department]] by [[James Peterson|Dr. James Peterson]]. When Dr. Carlsmith was discovered by [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] in the [[Emergency Room|ER]], she reconnected with her former student.\n\nDuring Dr. Carlsmith stay, she also bonded with Dr. James Peterson. She reminded him of his grandmother, who had also passed from cancer. They played gin as they discussed her test results and Dr. Peterson updated her diagnosis as end-stage cancer since it had metastasized to her liver. Although the news of dying soon didn't dismay Dr. Carlsmith, she refused hospice care and placed her trust in greater forces, to the surprise of Dr. Peterson.\n\nDr. Carlsmith also met [[Henry Montgomery|Addison's son]] and revealed her past regarding her own baby. She counseled Addison through troubles with a former patient and requested for Addison to write a letter and deliver it to her daughter.\n\nShe later succumbed to her illness at the age of  and died at St. Ambrose Hospital not knowing that her daughter had lived a wonderful and full life.\n\n\n\nShe gave birth to a baby at age . She wanted to keep the baby, but her mother sent her away to give birth and give her baby to a catholic family. After the baby was born, she was supposed to have time to hold her before she was taken away, but Vivian's mother wouldn't allow it and took her home right after she gave birth.\n\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nShe served as a mentor for Addison when Addison was becoming a doctor. When Vivian was diagnosed with gastric cancer, Addison visited her frequently and brought her son to visit as well. Vivian asked Addison to write a letter for her and dictated a letter to the daughter she'd been forced to give up. Addison then delivered the letter.\n\n[[James Peterson]]\nWhen Vivian was hospitalized at the end of her life, James regularly visited her. He told Addison she reminded him of his grandmother, who had also died of cancer.\n\n\nDr. Carlsmith was an [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|obstetrician-gynecologist]] and a [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|perinatologist]]. She made advances in maternal-fetal medicine during a time when there was no treatment for high-risk pregnancies, inventing a technique to place a temporary plug in the fetal trachea.\n\nDuring her OB/GYN [[Resident|residency]], she was the only female surgeon of her class. Despite being tortured by the other male residents, Dr. Carlsmith forged ahead, accrediting her strength to her mother.\n\nLater in her career, Dr. Carlsmith served as a mentor for [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Dr. Addison Montgomery]] and worked with [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]].\n\nAdditionally, she published a paper regarding patients presenting with labor in Frank Breech, and how to treat using the external cephalic version technique.

They talked about his history working for an HMO and she wondered why he'd wanted to have dinner with her. He said he'd spent most of his life being a rich jerk, but he watched his best friend die of ALS and it changed him. He wanted to start a state-of-the-art medical practice and asked Naomi to run it. He'd done his research on her and knew she was the best. Naomi declined, saying she'd never leave [[Oceanside Wellness Group]]. William came to the practice, but Naomi continued to insist that she wasn't going to take his offer. He told her she was the only person on his list and he'd be back in two weeks to make an official offer.\n\nHe went to visit Charlotte, to asked her how [[Pacific Wellcare Center|his practice]] was running. She said they'd hit a few bumps, but she was confident things would work out. He said he'd be back in a few weeks and she could bring him up to speed then. ''(\"[[What You Do for Love]]\")''\n\nWilliam returned and met with all the doctors in Pacific Wellcare except [[Charlotte King]], drawing her suspicion. He also took Naomi out to dinner again. She believed that she was no longer a good candidate because of the embryo switch between [[Zoe Salter]] and [[Amelia Sawyer]]. He believed her worth was beyond one mistake.\n\nCharlotte confronted William, showing him letters from intent for three top doctors just waiting for his signature to bring them on. He went to her and reminded her that she used her doctors and that's why they didn't like her. He needed someone with a heart to run the practice. Naomi accepted the job. ''(\"[[Yours, Mine & Ours]]\")''\n\n\nWilliam hired [[Gabriel Fife]] without consulting with Naomi. He came to the practice, saying he saw a lot of potential in Gabriel's work. ''(\"[[Slip Slidin' Away]]\")''\n\n\nWilliam was being awarded with Man of the Year at a ball. Naomi was called upon to present the award to him. After she presented the award to him, they sat at a table together and she confessed that her life was all work lately and she was mad and believed he was flirting with her. He confirmed that he was flirting and asked her to dance with him. That night, they left the practice together and shared a kiss in the elevator. ''(\"[[Love Bites]]\")''\n\n\nAfter seeing William drop a glass, Pete became suspicious about William's health. Him struggling to open a jar later, they talked about ALS. William asked Pete if he wanted to study ALS as a complement to Gabriel's research. Pete confronted him and asked when he'd been diagnosed. He admitted he'd been diagnosed eight years prior and was in remission until the previous spring. He asked Pete not to tell Naomi. ''(\"[[Triangles]]\")''\n\nWilliam then went to Switzerland for treatment without telling Naomi. However, while he was gone, Gabriel told Naomi about the ALS, prompting her to fly to Switzerland to join him. ''(\"[[Pulling the Plug]]\")''\n\nHe returned to Los Angeles from Switzerland having declined significantly. Naomi admitted to Pete that she believed he'd come back to die. She asked Gabriel to give him the treatment. He initially refused, but ultimately agreed to have the treatment sent over.

She asked if he was just trying to get her into bed, but he said he was wooing her.

When she found out he was there to be treated for ALS, she flew to Switzerland to join him.

Naomi admitted to Pete that she believed he'd come back to die, which prompted her to ask Gabriel for his ALS treatment. He initially refused, but ultimately agreed to give him the treatment.

One of the first patients he treated was [[Leah Hudley]]. He offered her a clinical trial which would fight her cancer while preserving her fertility. After she suffered a colon perforation, the labs showed that her tumor was shrinking, but she decided to stop his protocol. ''(\"[[Know When to Fold]]\")''\n\n\nWyatt came up to [[Oceanside Wellness Group]] to talk to Naomi. He wanted her to consult on the case of [[Claudia Jenkins]], a cancer survivor who wanted a baby. No one had successfully conceived after surviving the type of cancer she had, so he knew that if she wanted a chance, she needed the best. When Naomi initially refused, Wyatt brought Claudia to see her so that she could meet her. ''(\"[[Worlds Apart]]\")''\n\nWhen the first attempt to implant ovarian tissue into Claudia's abdomen failed, Naomi suggested putting it in deeper, but in order to do that, they needed to call in Addison. Addison agreed to do the surgery on the condition that she would do all the follow up care, including following the pregnancy if it worked. Wyatt observed the surgery and became upset when Addison said the tissue was too friable to implant the ovarian tissue. He said that she needed to keep looking for a solution, but she said it was over. ''(\"[[Contamination]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Wyatt found out that [[Gracie Rousakis]] had burkholderia cepacia, he suggested that he might be able to treat her. However, his treatment was unsuccessful. ''(\"[[Homeward Bound]]\")''\n\n\nAfter sharing a kiss with Addison, Wyatt left Los Angeles. ''(\"[[Nothing to Fear]]\")''\n\nArcher later told her he'd left to seek pharmaceutical fortune.

''(\"[[Homeward Bound]]\")''\n\nEventually they kissed, and after her breakup with [[Kevin Nelson|Kevin]], she went to his office presumably to try to start a relationship, but walked into his office to discover [[Archer Montgomery|her brother]] and [[Naomi Bennett]] having sex instead. ''(\"[[Nothing to Fear]]\")''\n\n\nWyatt was Charlotte's big name for Pacific Wellcare and is a skilled [[Oncology|oncologist]].\n\nHis first encounter with Addison was over a patient with cancer who disagreed with Addison's decision on a radical hysterectomy as she wanted children, where Wyatt tried his drug regime and enlisted Naomi's assistance to help. Unfortunately, the patient began bleeding into her abdomen and required surgery to correct it, leading her to follow Addison's initial course of treatment.\n\nWhen a young cystic fibrosis patient at [[Oceanside Wellness Group|Oceanside Wellness]] was diagnosed with Burkholderia cepacia, which would be fatal for her, Wyatt proved resourceful, claiming he had had success in treating his patients who developed the same infection.

However, when she came in for a checkup, Naomi had to inform her that a mistake had been made and the fetus she was carrying came from an embryo supplied by [[Amelia Sawyer]] while Amelia was pregnant with Zoe and Marty's baby.\n\nNaomi shared the news with Amelia and the Salters separately, but they figured out what had happened as they left. Zoe and Amelia had met each other in the waiting room and bonded over their similar stories. Amelia wanted to continue the pregnancy and have Zoe do the same, saying she'd respect the Salters' wishes. However, Zoe said she and her husband wanted to terminate and start over with the other embryos they had stored. When Amelia heard that, she said if they terminated, she'd have the baby she was carrying and keep it.\n\nZoe later returned to the practice to talk to Amelia. Amelia told Zoe she wanted the baby she was carrying, but understood she couldn't make Zoe carry him. She believed that maybe it happened because the baby she was carrying, Zoe and Martin's, was her new chance. Naomi said sometimes, you have to let go of one dream so you can move forward with another one. Zoe said she couldn't let Amelia keep the baby, apologized, and left.\n\nZoe returned to the practice and suggested that she could continue to carry Amelia's baby while Amelia carried hers and they could switch them after they were born. ''(\"[[Yours, Mine & Ours]]\")''\n\n\nZoe and Amelia began seeing another OB for their pre-natal care. However, when he found something that might be wrong with the baby Zoe was carrying, he said they needed a surgical consult and recommended Addison. Addison did an ultrasound and diagnosed a fetal teratoma that was taking over the baby's blood supply. Addison recommended surgery, but advised Zoe that she'd have to perforate the uterus, which can sometimes cause problems for future pregnancies. Martin had left her because he didn't understand the bond between Zoe and Amelia and the decision they'd made. Zoe said she couldn't do it, so Addison recommended termination. Zoe decided she wanted to wait and left the fetus die in utero naturally, to get Amelia further along in her pregnancy. She didn't want Zoe to think she'd just given up. Addison wanted her to tell Amelia, but Zoe said that she couldn't.\n\nAmelia went to see Naomi, saying she thought something was wrong with the baby and Addison and Zoe were lying to her about it.\n\nThey called Zoe in and Naomi told her about what Amelia had said to her. She reminded her about the decision she'd made. Zoe said that she felt like both babies were both of theirs. If she told Amelia what she was going to do, it would be bad for Amelia's already-high blood pressure. She was already at risk for eclampsia and they could lose both babies. Addison again recommended the surgery. Naomi told her she either needed to let Addison operate or let her end the pregnancy because that was the safest choice if she wanted to get pregnant again. Zoe said she'd do it, but they needed to tell Amelia why the surgery couldn't be done because she couldn't do it.\n\nThey called Amelia in and told her about the teratoma. Amelia said she understood. She said she was worried at first that Zoe wouldn't try to make it work. When she heard they wanted to terminate, she told Zoe she wanted to be there for her. Her blood pressure was high, so they gave her oxygen, which helped. After seeing what Amelia was going through for the baby she was carrying, Zoe decided to take the risk and have the surgery.\n\nAddison operated. Zoe was fine afterward, but Addison was unable to save the baby. Amelia said it was okay because the baby she was carrying was still okay and they were a family. When Marty showed up and made up with Zoe, Amelia left. Naomi told her she couldn't leave and keep the baby, but Amelia said he was all she had left.\n\nMartin was enraged about Amelia leaving, but Zoe said she believed that Amelia was a good person and would come back.
