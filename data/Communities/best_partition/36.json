She had a few too many drinks and when leaving the bar, she was attacked and raped.\n\nJo was walking through the lobby at the hospital when she ran into Abby, who had a cut on her cheek. She got lost looking for the ER. In the ER, when pressed, she revealed a bruised abdomen. An ultrasound showed that her diaphragm had been ruptured and her organs were pushed up into her chest. Before she could have surgery, Jo said she believed that Abby had been sexually assaulted and she wanted her to have the option to get justice if she felt differently. She agreed to let them collect a sexual assault evidence kit. Jo then told her that the kit would stay at the hospital if she decided she wanted to talk to the cops.\n\nWhen Abby was ready for her surgery, she started to panic because she said every man has his face. Jo had all the female employees of the hospital paged to line the hallway between her room and the elevator, to lend their support and make sure she didn't see any men's faces as she was wheeled to surgery.\n\nAbby's surgery went well and after she woke up, she was told she'd need a drain for a few days, but she'd be okay. They also suggested that she talk to someone, saying it didn't have to be her husband, but they felt it would help her. After talking with Jo about her own experience, Abby called her husband and the police to file a report.\n\n\n\nShe is married to a man named Jack.

In a desperate attempt to restore function, Webber suggested just paying the ransom. He was shocked when he learned that the amount the hackers were asking for was close to $ million. When Bailey asked Jackson to loan them the money, Heyward said it was a bad idea, as it would open the door for other hospitals to be hacked in the same way, putting thousands of others in danger.

He then left them tape and a marker to make name tags for themselves before leaving them.\n\nAlma was supposed to be in the ER, but when one intern, Jenson, quit after two hours, she ended up on discharges. She refused to discharge a patient to a nursing home that was overrun with Covid cases, saying she wanted to speak to the patient's doctor, Meredith, before doing anything further.\n\nAt the end of the day, Richard Webber took Alma, along with her daughter, Sara, and [[Reza Khan]], into an OR, where he gave them a modified version of his traditional intern speech.

Alma comforted Veronica when she expressed regret at having passed COVID- to her mother, assuring her that her mother would never regret hugging her. Later, when both mother and daughter declined and needed ventilators, and only one was available, Alma said the protocol was to use it on the person with a better chance of survival, meaning Veronica. With that decided, they put Veronica on the ventilator. However, Maggie then had an idea to use a y-shaped tube to split the ventilator power so both of them could use a single machine. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nWhen the Catherine Fox Foundation sponsored a free COVID testing day at the hospital, Alma helped swab patients as they came through. She became irritated when she learned that Jackson was renting hotel rooms for patients who tested positive but had difficulty isolating from family members who weren't infected. She told him that him booking hotel rooms at full rate ousted charities who were renting them at a discounted rate to help unhoused people. He ended up having her make a list of things she would do if she had the capital, as she had the knowledge of how to help people most effectively.

He developed a romantic relationship with [[Meredith Grey]]. He was the younger brother of [[Carina DeLuca]].\n\n\n\nAndrew was born and raised in Italy. His father, also a surgeon, used to take him and his sister Carina out fishing. While in a manic episode, his father operated on seven people in a row without food or sleep and lost four of his patients. Because of his connections, he got away with it, but Andrew's mother left him over it. She then took a young Andrew with her and moved to the United States, while his father and Carina stayed in Italy.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref> At some point, his mother went back to visit his sister in Italy. While she was there, he received a call from Carina that their mother had gotten sick and that he needed to get there as soon as possible. When he arrived, he learned his mother had died even before the call, but Carina couldn't handle telling him that over the phone as she wanted to be able to hug him after delivering the bad news.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nRight after high school, Andrew worked as an EMT. He said he loved it and it's what made him decide to go to medical school. His second call out was an MVC. He arrived to find a woman in the front seat bleeding from her neck. He was trying to stop the bleeding, but she was wailing, holding her dead toddler in her arms. That's when he decided not to go into peds.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\nWhile living on the East Coast, he met [[Sam Bello]] and they had a tumultuous, on-and-off-again relationship. When they broke up, she wouldn't return his calls. In an attempt to get her attention, he kidnapped her dog, so she broke into his apartment to get it back. He then moved across the country to the West Coast without telling her goodbye, so she blocked him on all social media and they didn't hear from each other for years.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn his way to his first day as an intern, Andrew came across the tunnel collapse. When [[Joan Paulson]] was extracted, he rode in with her in the ambulance. When they ran out of splints, he used his tie to stabilize her wrist. After Joan was taken into the hospital, he asked if he needed to fill out paperwork, but Owen, not knowing Andrew is an intern, said that he could do it later if he was okay jumping in and continuing to help.\n\nAndrew was forced to admit that he was only an intern when Joan's neck dislocated and he didn't know how to help Stephanie fix it.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the doctors realized they'd need to get [[Keith Gardner]] to an OR quickly so he wouldn't bleed to death, Andrew, along with the other interns, was posted along the path to clear the way. He then rounded out his first day by rounding on [[Joan Paulson]], who was by then stable and expected to make a full recovery.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nBecause the other interns believed he had posed as an attending on purpose, they didn't want to live with him or be friends with him, so when [[Arizona Robbins]] posted about having a room available to rent, he jumped at the chance. She was initially suspicious, but said they could work it out, and they eventually became friends shortly after.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew attended [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] anatomy class.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Jade Bell collapsed and came to the hospital, Andrew wanted to page neuro after they stitched up her head. Later, when she collapsed in the hospital, Andrew was quick to take a door off its hinges to use as a backboard.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\n\nSeeing that the interns weren't well-trained in delivering bad news to patient families, [[Owen Hunt]] insisted that they all be trained. He taught them the four Ls (Location, language, body language, and leave) and informed them that they'd be telling the families of the people who died in the ER that day.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Andrew was helping Jo get into bed after a night of drinking, Alex walked in and saw Andrew on top of her. Assuming that Andrew was sexually assaulting her, Alex violently physically assaulted Andrew, leading to the former temporarily injuring his hand and the latter sustaining several critical injuries.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew decided to press charges, Alex and his attorney thought it was for a misdemeanor, but quickly learned that the state had upped the charge to felony assault. Alex pled not guilty.\n\nLater, Alex went to the District Attorney's office to take a plea deal, but Andrew unexpectedly walked in and tried to drop all charges against Alex. When he was told that since the case belonged to the state, he could not do that, he threatened to sabotage the case, which the attorney said was \"a slam dunk.\" Andrew walked out before Alex could understand why he decided to drop the charges. The two eventually had a conversation outside of the hospital in which Andrew says that he did it to protect Jo, and expressed frustration that Alex never apologized when he had the chance.\n\n\nAndrew grew concerned over Amelia when he witnessed her diving into [[Beau Martinez|Beau Martinez']] case and ignoring Owen and Megan. He tried to voice those concerns to Jo at Joe's, but she thought he wanted to talk about the two of them dating. He then left the bar and went home, where he found his sister about to have sex with Arizona.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref> After arguing in Italian, Andrew decided he would sleep at the hospital. Carina, knowing that Andrew worked for a female chief of surgery, asked him to introduce her to Bailey and got permission from her to conduct research for her study involving scanning the female orgasm using an MRI at Grey Sloan. Andrew tried to talk Amelia out of operating on Beau given the fact that it could cause more harm, but she persisted.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Carina show Amelia her tumor.]]\nDuring the surgery, Amelia made Andrew get Jackson, forcing him to help despite his refusal to participate in the risky surgery earlier. Afterwards, Jackson told them they got lucky when the surgery turned out successful. Later, when Andrew went to talk to Carina about conducting her research at the hospital he worked at, they found that the current study subject had a brain tumor in her frontal lobe. It was Amelia's.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew has to keep Amelia's tumor a secret while she and Tom plan its removal.]]\nFor a week, Amelia told Andrew to keep her tumor a secret, which he felt uncomfortable about doing. Amelia called her old teacher, [[Tom Koracick]], to come and perform the surgery. While Amelia had another scan, she directed Andrew to gather all of her recent case files for her to go over in case any mistakes were made on her part. Later, Andrew tried to tell Maggie about the tumor by talking to her about their failed relationship in a room with Amelia's brain scans shown throughout the room, hoping Maggie would notice, but she did not. Later, Amelia told her herself.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nDuring Amelia's surgery, Andrew assisted Koracick with the removal of the tumor. Prior to the surgery, Andrew, Amelia, and Tom did the superhero pose together. He tried to ask questions about the procedure, which Amelia had suggested to make Koracick work faster, but he was ignored by Koracick, who was singing to music while operating and told Andrew to either sing or shut up. The surgery was successful and during her recovery, Andrew used early ambulation on Amelia.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew checks on Amelia as she recovers.]]\nKoracick tried to order Andrew to stop as he witnessed her struggle, but Andrew continued, saying that this was Amelia's treatment and that she had ordered him to do it no matter what and to ignore Koracick if he told him to stop. Koracick told Andrew that if anything happened, it was his fault. After Amelia recovered, she asked Andrew to run more scans, because she felt that there was something wrong. To ease her concerns, Andrew brought Amelia the removed tumor and showed it to her. He told her that the reason why she felt something was wrong was because for a long time, there was in fact something wrong, but now there wasn't anymore and that, for her, could feel wrong. She realized he was right and hugged him.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew joins the other men to hang out on Jackson's boat.]]\nJackson invited Andrew to come hang with him and the other men on his newly purchased boat. He asked Andrew to pick up food since they would be grilling. Andrew met them on the boat with several big fish. Jackson organized a fish filleting contest, which Andrew turned out to be good, as he had learned it from his father when he took him and Carina fishing. When Jackson brought up his new apartment, Andrew said he would be looking for a place soon with Sofia moving back to Seattle. Owen then invited him to come live with him for a while. Soon after, the attendings were paged for the intern mixer, leaving Andrew to clean up their mess. Afterwards, he went to the hospital and found Arizona. He told her he would be staying with Owen, after which they saw Carina and Owen kiss. He couldn't believe she was sleeping with another friend of his and opted against moving in with Owen. Later, he came across the new batch of interns and learned that his ex-girlfriend [[Sam Bello]] was one of them.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nGiven their tumultuous history, Andrew ignored her at work. When she confronted him about it, he reminded her of their history and said they only hurt each other when they get together. He thought she followed him to Seattle, but she denied that. Sam had to get burn supplies but she didn't know where to get them, so Ben made Andrew show her. They diverted and ended up having sex in the skills lab. They were caught by Bailey and Webber. When Carina found out, she reminded Andrew that he and Sam were not healthy together. He later ran into her in an on-call room. She went to leave, but he stopped her and asked her to swear she hadn't followed him to Seattle. She told him they were bad for each other. However, they ended up making out again.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nThey had sex everywhere in the hospital all the time, so everybody knew. When the hospital was hacked, Richard taught Andrew some old-school tricks to treat his patients without modern technology.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> Sam started to spiral when the hackers turned up the heat in the hospital. Richard asked Andrew to keep her away from patients. Andrew tried to recuse himself, so Richard revealed he knew about their sexual relationship. He offered to have sex to calm her down, but she told him he was not a person who calmed her down. She said his distracting her didn't make her feel like the brilliant intern she could be, so she decided no more sex. Later, Amelia invited Andrew to be the new Edwards and she also put Sam on her team when she found out that Sam had written a paper that had impressed Amelia.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nShe had them do viability research on five proposed projects for the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. While left alone in the lab, he became distracted by her tongue as she was eating chips, so he retaliated by playing their song. She told him to stop seducing her and quickly left. The next day, they continued and Sam took off her scrub top because reading about neuroscience made her overheat, a fact he remembered well. Amelia then came in and told them to stop the viability studies and instead look into ways to remove gliomas without cutting, as she was looking to cure [[Kimmie Park]]. They found nothing, but Amelia herself came up with the idea to use ultrasound ablation, something that had never been done before in brains. They submitted it as a proposal for the Contest, but it didn't make it to round . They resorted to drinking at Joe's to deal with the disappointment.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia and Alex decided to continue the research, but their approach only led to frying tissue. [[Tom Koracick]] joined the project and commented on Sam being hot. Tom wondered why Amelia was in such a rush to get results. Unaware that Amelia was keeping Tom away from Kimmie, Andrew showed Tom the scans and introduced him to Kimmie. They later adjusted to using multiple beams to come at the tumor from different angles, which still wasn't perfect but seemed to be the right direction to further explore.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working in the ER, Andrew slipped on a sliced-off ear and hit his head. Amelia had his head scanned and diagnosed a grade  concussion, meaning he had to rest with limited stimuli in a patient room. He was only concerned that Sam saw him fall. His peace and quiet was disturbed when Carina and Arizona came to discuss their maternal mortality project in his room. After encouragement from Amelia, Sam went to his room. Before she could confess her love, he told her they were young before, but now they weren't. They were there together and she was never just sex to him. They confessed their mutual love and decided to try to make it work. She climbed into bed with him and they snuggled there, which was witnessed by Amelia as she walked by.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nApril fetched Andrew to help her out on trauma certification day. At one point, she made him pretend to be dying. Sam had to work on reviving him and they started arguing. April had been spiraling, so intern Casey sent her on a wild goose chase with fake pages as she was the thing that was endangering his patients the most. In an attempt to keep her calm, Andrew brought up that he heard she cheated on her trauma certification, too. She said she did and then lost a patient mere months later because she didn't know what to do. She then fully lost control of herself. She said you can do everything right and people still die and frantically started to perform CPR on a dummy. Andrew checked if she was okay. Distraught, she called off the exercise and went inside.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the time came to test their perfected ultrasound ablation project on [[Noah Brosniak]], the team was very nervous as they were unsure if it would work as they hoped. To calm Amelia down, Andrew initiated the superhero pose. The procedure took a long time because heat built up inside Noah's skull with nowhere to disperse, so they had to wait regularly to let it all cool down. After finishing, Amelia went to throw up and Andrew checked on her. While waiting for Noah to wake up, Andrew and Sam went to sleep in an on-call room. Upon waking up, they realized they had spent their night together again and she wondered about his place. She looked around and discovered a box of his stuff. She realized he was living there. He said he was in between places and she invited him to come live with her.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew thinks Carina called ICE on Sam.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew comforts Sam as she faces deportation.]]\nHe did move in with her. As they arrived at the hospital together, Carina mocked them for playing house, but he bounced back that he was in a monogamous relationship that had lasted longer than any of hers. Later, Taryn came to get Andrew for Meredith. He was told that ICE was looking for Sam to deport her back to El Salvador despite her not having been there since she was one year old and not knowing anyone there. She was there under DACA, but she was caught running a red light, which was apparently reason enough for her to be deported. Meredith suggested a greencard marriage. Andrew was open to the idea, but Sam remembered it wouldn't get her legal status, so they thought about other options. Andrew thought Carina had called ICE on Sam and went to confront her, but she said she would never do that to him or Sam. Andrew returned to the OR where they making plans for Sam and suggested they run away to Canada, but Meredith said ICE was treating her as if she snuck into the country illegally and that they couldn't let her become what they were trying to make her be.\n\nMeredith came up with the idea to send Sam to Switzerland to work under [[Cristina Yang]] as Sam's level of medical training would transfer and provided her with a fake application dated back a year. Sam accepted. They said goodbye as the cab arrived at the hospital. He wanted to follow her to Switzerland as soon as he could, but she didn't want him to throw his life away just because she had to. She then confessed she had in fact followed him to Seattle. She told him they didn't work even if they did. After a last kiss, she left for the airport. Maggie came out to comfort Andrew, but he ignored her and went back inside.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was one of the doctors who ate weed cookies. Arizona took him and Maggie into a skills lab so they could wait for the weed to wear off. He lied down on the ground and hallucinated Sam lying with him. After he spent the better part of the day smiling at the hallucination, he tried to reach out, but his hand went right through her. He started sobbing. Maggie took pity on him and took him back to her house. He got comfortable on the couch and she covered him up with a blanket.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref> He stayed at the house and called in sick to work. He just played some guitar, sang songs he made up, and neglected to shower. He slept while Maggie cooked for them. Meredith tried to get Arizona to talk some sense into him, but Arizona got Carina to do it. Carina accompanied Meredith to her house and yelled at him about his behavior, which would make their father ashamed.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref> On his first day back, he was acting tough with the interns, so Maggie invited him on her case to cheer him up. He assisted her and Arizona as they performed a spina bifida surgery on an exteriorized uterus.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Nicole Herman]] returned to the hospital with headaches, Andrew assisted Amelia to find the cause. Amelia was afraid she would have to tell Nicole about her own tumor if Nicole's tumor had grown back. Since the scans were clear, Andrew performed a spinal tap, which led them to diagnose a spinal fluid leak. They only needed to place a shunt to fix that.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew got drunk at Jo and Alex's wedding with the interns. While the guests were waiting for the officiant, the wedding planner tried to fill up the time with a toast. She passed the mic to Andrew, who talked about how he viewed Jo and Alex as family since blood had been spilled between them. He talked about how have to celebrate true love before it's ripped from your claws. Meredith noticed he was spiraling and cut in to take him for a walk. She told him she knew what it was like to lose your love, but he was young and handsome, so he would find love again. She reminded him to look forward. He then leaned in and kissed her. She stopped it and said she was not seducing him. He thought he would be fired, but she was just flattered. They then found Alex and Jo trapped in a shed and freed them.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew is among the guests for Jo and Alex's impromptu ferry wedding.]]\nThe ceremony was called off because of all the things that had gone wrong, including the wedding planner having an allergic reaction, so all guests boarded the ferry back to the city. Meredith officiated an impromptu wedding for the couple on the ferry.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew slept off his hangover on Maggie and Jackson's couch. He wanted to call in sick, but Jackson made him walk to work with them. While walking, Andrew remembered he had kissed Meredith and he felt horrified. He noticed a car speeding towards the crosswalk and he pulled Maggie and Jackson out of harm's way. The car did hit [[Nisha]]. Andrew called an ambulance and Jackson thanked him for saving their lives. At the hospital, he went to Meredith and apologized for kissing her. He promised it wouldn't happen again, but unbeknownst to him, she had been having sex dreams about him. In the OR, Vik made a bottle of hair product stuck inside a man's rectum explode by cauterizing a bleeding in the area around it. The bottle shot around the OR and hit Vik, whose sleeve caught on fire. Andrew reacted quickly and extinguished the flames. Vik thanked him for saving his life. Andrew and Richard failed to resuscitate the patient.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> The high of saving three lives in one day got Andrew out the slump he'd been in since Sam's departure and he wanted to get back at saving lives. His renewed lust for life led him to buy a motorcycle from a patient after he had had an accident with it. After testing it out, he offered Richard to take a ride.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew's motorcycle attracts attention from the sisters.]]\nHis motorcycle attracted attention from Maggie, Meredith, and Amelia. Maggie tried to set him up with Amelia in an attempt to get her to leave Owen before Teddy could drop her pregnancy bomb on them, but Amelia wasn't interested. Andrew was surprised she would do that given his history with Maggie, but she said their history was ancient. Meredith then caught his eye, as she had been lingering in his mind since the kiss. That night, Andrew took Link and Richard to Joe's bar.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nCarina informed Andrew she would be returning to Italy because there was something going on with their father. She only told him he was not dying, but didn't elaborate further. They came across Meredith, who was dressed up for a date, and Andrew was stunned by her beauty. Andrew, Maggie, and Bailey treated [[Natalie Forrester]], who was rapidly declining. [[Evan Forrester]] tried to keep her impending death from their son [[Max Forrester|Max]], but he had noticed that she wasn't doing well. Andrew took him to the helipad to distract him. Andrew shared with him the story of his mother's death to illustrate that the truth can be scary, but Max only took away from it that his father was lying to him about his mother's death. Max then ran off. Andrew chased after him. While he was looking for Max around the hospital, he came across Carina and told her she was a good sister.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref> Andrew and Maggie joined Station 's search efforts and he was impressed with their work. When the rescue was over, he gave a firefighter's number to Vic, who had been quite hostile towards him for tagging along against protocol.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], x (S)</ref>\n\nWhen Owen was out for the day, Richard took charge in the ER and presented Andrew with the opportunity to watch over the interns there. Richard checked in on them stitching up several lacerations and pointed out that Levi needed some pointers, which Andrew then provided. Richard told him he should have noticed that himself and told him to take initiative. Later, a patient needed to be intubated. Levi went to get Richard, but Andrew had done it himself without accepting any help from Taryn by the time he arrived. Richard reminded him they were a teaching hospital. Andrew thought Richard had a problem with him, but Richard said it was the contrary. He needed doctors who not only give the best care but also teach others to do the same, and he saw potential for that in Andrew. After work, Andrew, Link, and Richard went to Joe's again to play guitar and sing.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was supposed to operate on [[Flor Medina]] with Meredith and Alex, but when he discovered that Flor had a little crush on him and preferred he didn't operate on her, he decided to sit the surgery out. He told Meredith he really wanted to work with her, but she said there would be more chances for that in the future. Andrew checked in on Flor after the surgery and sat with her. She asked about some of his favorite things and if he had a girlfriend. He told her he did not have one.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Link both express interest in Meredith.]]\nAfterwards, he ran into Meredith and complimented her on the flower tucked behind her ear. They exchanged some banter about his post-op \"date\" with Flor and he asked about her date, which had been set up by [[Cece Colvin]]. She told him she had scared the guy off. The elevator then arrived and both Andrew and Link held the doors open for her. Confused by their sudden chivalry, she decided to take the stairs.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was put on Cece's case as she started to deteriorate. A patient who got injured in the windstorm proved a perfect match for her. They went to tell Cece and Andrew told her she was only getting this organ because the storm was preventing UNOS from sending the organ anywhere else. He stressed that she was in a bad condition and the chances were real that she would not make it off the table. Nevertheless, Cece accepted the organs and urged Meredith to squeeze all the joy she could out of the life she had been given. Afterwards, Andrew overheard that Meredith accepted Link's invitation for drinks that night. Andrew then found Meredith in the scan room and apologized for having been so blunt with Cece. She called him brave for doing that. He then told her that she had been on his mind since the kiss and that he wanted her to know he was one of her options. He said he was a senior resident, so it wouldn't be an abuse of power, and added that Maggie didn't mind, either. She could make up all the excuses, but he said there was something undeniable between them. They almost kissed, but Meredith said she didn't trust herself. She promised to think about what he had said and left. They later ended up on an elevator together on their way to the OR for Cece. A power outage had the elevator trapped between floors and left them stuck together.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith bond while stuck in an elevator.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Link both ask Meredith out on a date.]]\nNeither of them had a signal. He likened their situation to being in the TARDIS, where time and space and the rules don't apply, but she said the rules still applied. They sat down and she asked him about moving to Italy, promising it would stay between them. In Italian, he shared the story of why his mother and father split up. He then tried to lift her up to the trap door, but she couldn't reach it. She dropped back into his arms and their lips nearly touched. He asked why them kissing would be so bad. She repeated she was his superior and that she was trying to learn from her past mistakes. In Italian, he told her about how badly he wanted to kiss her. She revealed she had taken Italian in college and had therefor understood every word. As they leaned in and nearly kissed, the elevator started working again. The doors opened and she rushed to the OR. She lost Cece in the OR and ran into Andrew after getting off the elevator. He joked she didn't seem to learn from her mistakes as she still used the elevator. She commented on his cocky behavior and he asked her out on a date. Link then came up to ask her the same question. She felt haunted by Cece's ghost and went home to her children without giving an answer to either of them.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nWhenever they operated together, Andrew would observe Meredith closely and try to seduce her. On another case, Andrew had to step up to perform an emergent subtotal colectomy when Owen was accidentally paralyzed by the anesthesiologist. Alex later checked in and told him he had done a great job. On a high, Andrew sent Meredith a text to come celebrate his flying solo with him, but she was getting to know Link at her son's birthday party and ignored him.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew again tried his luck on Christmas Eve and asked Meredith out for a drink, but she was heading home to put her kids to bed so Santa could come. She did, however, invite him to join her to Jo and Alex's NYE party. After they checked on [[Natasha Deon]] and witnessed Meredith talk to Link, Andrew asked her when she was going to stop stringing Link along and giving him false hope. Meredith wasn't sure it was false hope. Andrew was growing tired of wasting time not being with her. He thought she wasn't brave enough to choose him and asked if the NYE party was a date or if she'd ignore him there. She confirmed it was a date. However, she chose to stay with Natasha and [[Garrett Boland|Garrett]] and stood up both Andrew and Link.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew confronts Meredith with her behavior towards him.]]\nHe was angry with her and she apologized but said she had a patient. He told her she also had a phone and that she was just rude to treat him like a doormat. While doing another surgery on Natasha, Levi came out as gay and said he had found someone who made him happy. Andrew said life's too short not to share it with someone who lights up your world, not so subtly hinting at Meredith that he wanted to be with her. On Valentine's Day, Natasha's condition had become dire, but Meredith urged Garrett not to give up. Andrew later questioned how she could tell Garrett that if she herself kept running away from love. He used to think she was so beyond him, but he had changed his mind about that. He called her a kid hiding behind excuses like her job and her family. Meredith then turned around and asked Link out on a date. Andrew was later present when Meredith officiated a wedding between a dying Natasha and Garrett. Afterwards, Andrew took Meredith up the roof for a spontaneous date with champagne. They made a toast to Garrett and Natasha. She decided not to go on her date with Link and shared her first real kiss with Andrew.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith refused to let Andrew take her on a real date until she had cleared it with Maggie, so he resorted to buying her coffee and staring at her longingly at work. She took him aside and told him to quit the staring as it was distracting her. At the end of the day, Meredith paged Andrew to a lounge. She had been given Maggie's blessing and decided she would take him out as she didn't want to sit on the back of his motorcycle. He agreed to the plan but only if it could be his treat. They shared a kiss and left holding hands.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew assisted Meredith while she was breaking the hospital's longest surgery record. He distracted her when she needed him to by telling a story of the time when, as a kid, he believed that he had broken the record of most rollercoaster rides in one day. After the surgery, Andrew found her sleeping on a gurney in a hallway. He transferred her to a bed in an empty room and left her to sleep.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith kiss before heading into the party.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith and Andrew realized they caused the \"fire.\"]]\nOn the day of Catherine's party, Meredith informed Chief Karev of their relationship. They went to the party together, but as they had her house to themselves, they didn't plan on staying long. However, Meredith got sucked into Amelia's drama with Owen, preventing them from leaving soon. As Amelia was planning to come sleep at the house, Meredith and Andrew resorted to making out in the guest room. He got a call from Carina, but he declined it to keep on kissing his girlfriend. They were caught by Richard, who awkwardly left. They went back downstairs to the party and, in an attempt to act normal, took over from the catering staff. They put a tray of egg rolls in the oven. The tray was made out of plastic and caused the entire apartment to fill with smoke. Everyone was evacuated. While out on the street, they decided to go to Andrew's place to avoid any further distractions. However, as they arrived there, so did Carina and Vincenzo, their father. He greeted his son and Andrew introduced Meredith to him.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nThe siblings caught up and Andrew found out that his father had come here to pitch medical research. He seemed stable to him while Carina insisted he was bipolar. He briefly visited Meredith in her lab for a kiss and then joined his family for the research pitch to Alex. Vincenzo was looking for funding for external gestational research, which he had already gotten to the stage of animal trials. After  days, a healthy sheep was born. Alex asked for some time to consider. Andrew and Vincenzo then got coffee. Vincenzo told him he was hoping they could make up for the time they had lost because his controlling mother had come between them. He assured Andrew that the research would put him on the map so that Meredith wouldn't be beyond him anymore.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew asks Meredith to trust his judgment about his father.]]\nLater, Meredith found Andrew and Carina arguing. Andrew had decided to sign on for the research, while Carina insisted their father wasn't well. She stated she knew their father better than Andrew did and that their father knew how to manipulate Andrew into doing his bidding. Meredith had her doubts, knowing full well how clouded one's judgment can get, but Andrew was sure on the matter and asked her to trust him on it. Alex decided to fund the research. Before helping their father set up in the lab, the siblings met outside. Still on the fence about it herself, Carina hoped Andrew was right about this.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew wakes up in the lab.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Carina and her father have a fight.]]\nAndrew spent all his time on the research and even spent nights in the lab to monitor the lambs. Meredith brought him coffee as a peace offering to apologize for her suspicions about his dad. He appreciated that and invited her to spend a night at his place if were to spend it there himself. She accepted and went to work. That morning, a lamb died and an argument erupted between Carina and Vincenzo, who threw the former off the study. Alex had them write a report on the matter so he could review it. Carina pleaded with Andrew to see their father's illness, but Andrew insisted he was fine. Carina thought the project was too important to let it be ruined by their father. Andrew insisted she didn't have the right degree to diagnose him and that she always butted heads with their father like this. While continuing the work, Andrew told his father to control his tantrums because they didn't help their credibility. They discussed Carina backing out and Vincenzo wanted to reach out to make peace, but Andrew told him that she was occupied with a trauma patient who might lose her baby. Vincenzo went behind everyone's backs and pitched his research as a solution to the couple. He was scolded by Alex, but Vincenzo couldn't understand that it was way too soon for human trials.\n\nAndrew then finally saw the truth, but Vincenzo remained unbothered, stating he was the only one willing to do what it took to save that baby. Andrew realized it was just like that night when he insisted on saving those seven people by himself. Andrew told him that letting the baby die now was merciful compared to letting it die in a bag by the hands of a mad scientist who didn't know what he was doing, but Vincenzo did not agree. Alex then gathered the DeLucas in his office and announced he was pulling the funding. Infuriated and unwilling to let someone take over, Vincenzo packed up his stuff and moved his research back to Italy. Meredith visited Andrew as he was cleaning out the lab and he lashed out at her. She stated she would never tell she had been right. He apologized and said he shouldn't be around people. She told him to let her know if he needed anything and left.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew continued to keep his distance from Meredith. Andrew got put on Alex's service for a total pancreatectomy. The surgery was cancelled because the girl's labs showed a high glycemia. Alex told Andrew he was sorry about the cancellation. Suspecting Meredith had pulled strings to cheer him up, Andrew yelled that he didn't need any favors from him. Later, the doctors discovered that the girl had sabotaged her surgery by drinking juice. They found out she didn't want the surgery because then she would have to go back to school, where she was bullied. Andrew pushed the mother too hard to convince her daughter to get the surgery, so Alex threw him off the case. Andrew then went to talk to the girl behind Alex's back and shared how he had survived being bullied himself. Alex then performed the surgery without Andrew to punish him for disobeying him. Later, Andrew yelled at Alex for being unprofessional, but Alex told him that he was the unprofessional. He should have talked to Nora first before going at her mother like he did. Alex understood parents can do a number on their kids, but Andrew let it interfere with his job and his relationship today. Alex also told him not to bite people's hand when they reach out, because then they stop doing so. That night, Meredith visited him at home and told him she was past the time of wondering if her boyfriend was ignoring her. Andrew understood and said it hurt him that he was unable to help his father, so he needed some time to hurt and he didn't want to drag her down with him. Now he was ready to let her back in. He cooked them dinner and they enjoyed each other's company.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nRichard scheduled a solo lap appy for Andrew. Andrew examined the patient, who complimented him on his looks in front of Richard. She then asked Andrew to check out her Instagram. Richard told him it was part of the job so Andrew complied and listened to the patient talk about crossfit. In surgery, Richard asked about the long-term plan. Andrew thought he was talking about his relationship with Meredith and said they hadn't discussed it yet. He said he respected where Meredith came from and that she was amazing to him. Richard then said he meant Andrew's career. Andrew said he was attracted to general surgery. The surgery had to be converted to an open procedure when they came across dead bowel. Richard wanted to take over, but Andrew knew the steps of an ileocecectomy and pulled it off. Once Andrew was done, Richard complimented Andrew and said he'd put in a good word with the head of general surgery. That night, Meredith and Andrew had dinner at his place again and he talked her through his day.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nAs their relationship progressed, they also had sex at Meredith's house, but she wouldn't allow him to sleep over yet. One night, when he was sneaking out, he ran into Zola as she was getting some water from the kitchen. He returned to Meredith to tell her about it. She hated that her plan on how to tell them was now ruined, but he was just glad she had been planning to do so. She then checked if the coast was clear before sending him out again. Later at work, Meredith told him Zola appeared to be fine and she asked if he liked kids. He did, citing his  first cousins whom he all adored. Later, Meredith and Andrew had to deliver a baby of a woman who didn't know she was pregnant. Meredith later watched Andrew hold the baby in the woman's room, which convinced her to tell her kids about him.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile working in the clinic, Andrew encountered [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabriella]] and her father [[Luis Rivera]]. Luis had come to the U.S. on a visa and applied for asylum. He sent for his family once he had an apartment, but they were detained and separated at the border. Gabby had just arrived in Seattle with severe abdominal pain, having received little medical care while in detention. She was diagnosed with an obstruction and required surgery, for which Luis couldn't pay. Andrew took him to fill out forms to apply for state coverage, but it was denied because he made too much money cleaning offices. Meredith, who had joined the case, promised that she had a plan, which turned out to be filling out Ellis's name on the paperwork so they could benefit from her insurance. She knew it was wrong, but insisted that she was trying to remedy something even more wrong. However, in surgery, it was discovered that the obstruction was caused by a lymphoma, meaning the case wouldn't be over with just the one surgery. Andrew stood by as Meredith and Richard decided to make Gabby sicker on paper and keep her hospitalized for  days so that a new state policy would kick in, which was regardless of income. Throughout the day, Andrew had been quiet, so Meredith assumed he disapproved of her actions. However, he was actually in awe of her. He told her he could have been Gabby when he had come here from Italy and he loved that she didn't look away from the situation like so many people do. He had been quiet because he was afraid he'd tell her that he loved her if he opened his mouth. Taken aback, she told him she was glad they had cleared that up and quickly left.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew spent the night in a chair next to Gabby's bed. She woke him up by throwing her stuffed animals at him. Later, when she admitted to being scared of the MRI, he took her there to take a scan of one of her stuffed animals to show her how it worked. Alex walked in as he was doing so and hinted to a career in peds. Later, Andrew met Jo and Meredith outside of the conference room where Bailey and Catherine had been holed up all day. Meredith asked him to look after Jo while she went off to look for Alex. Jo brought up his love confession to Meredith, but he was soon paged to the room by Bailey.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Andrew takes the fall for Meredith.]]\nInside, he was informed that the insurance company had discovered the insurance fraud. Andrew took the fall for Meredith. Before he was arrested, he was allowed to go inform Meredith, who was stuck inside the pressurized hyperbaric chamber, of what he had done. He told her he had lied to her about Gabby having insurance and he apologized for using her daughter's name. He said what he did wasn't fair to her or her kids, who needed her. Meredith realized what he was doing and begged him not to, but his mind was made up and he was taken away by Catherine.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was arrested and escorted out of the hospital. Meredith later visited him in jail and told him his move was stupid, stating he would lose his license. He said he was called into a room and asked for details and he couldn't bring himself to turn her in. She told him that he needed to develop some instincts for self-preservation if they were going to be together. She wanted to clean up her own messes and live in her truth, because what she was trying to remedy was so much more wrong than what she did. Meredith then told him she was going to turn herself in to get it out. She admitted she felt terrified. She stated she loved him, too, and then walked out to go turn herself in.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith came clean and the charges against Andrew were dismissed. He sat in her corner during her meeting, where she confessed to not really regretting her actions, instead blaming the system, which landed her with court-ordered community service to pick up trash on the streets. He then returned to work with a cocky attitude to Bailey, knowing she was in need of help. He was put on the case of [[Jai Prishna]]. He convinced Jai's wife Mari not to give up hope just yet despite Jai living his worst nightmare of being hooked to machines. He promised to tell her when it was time to give up hope, but a week later, Jai recovered without deficits. After a few weeks of community service, Meredith ate ice cream with Andrew and told him that word of her community service got out at Zola's school, but she didn't care because she and her kids were healthy and she had found some sense of accomplishment in the work. As he joked about robbing a store to get some roadside vacation himself, her happiness disappeared when she found out that the medical board was pursuing action against her license.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew was dropping Meredith off for her community service when she found out that her medical license hearing was in three months. With the other residents, Andrew partook in Bailey's skills lab on the axillary-bifemoral bypass for [[Wade Foltz]], where he pointed out she was using different grafts than Meredith. He finished first in the skills lab but while Bailey had promised that the first one to finish would get to do the anastomosis, she chose Taryn instead, who had finished mere seconds after him. She did allow him to scrub in with them. When there was a bleeding from Taryn's suture line, Bailey had Andrew step in to fix it. Wade was fine in post-op. Andrew confronted Bailey with her choosing Taryn while he should have been the one to do that part of the surgery. He suggested she had sidelined him because of his relationship with Meredith. She warned him not to question her methods, as Taryn needed to experience the adrenaline and fear that makes you a surgeon, and told him not to make this personal. She suggested he started thinking about his career and let go of certain loyalties. After work at Meredith's, he was told by Meredith that she was going to write an article about the brokenness of the medical system after all the problems she had seen while on community service.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nWhile dropping Meredith off again, she told him she had gotten in touch with a website that was interested in publishing her article on the medical system. She listed some ideas she had, all of which would rub the medical community the wrong way. She didn't care since they were already in a fight anyway. At work, Andrew had to take responsibility and face Bailey's anger when Levi let a catheter guide wire slip into a patient under his supervision. They managed to save the patient in the cath lab. Afterwards, Andrew had Levi tell the patient's family but he had to take over as Levi was being too elaborate with needless details. At home, he told Meredith about it while having Link and Amelia over. The pair came to share the news that she was pregnant. Andrew congratulated them.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nMuch to her surprise, the website had pulled all of Meredith's ideas into one article that trashed Grey Sloan instead of the medical system itself. Andrew noticed the residents were panicking about the effect that would have on their future careers but they tried to shut him out because of his involvement with Meredith. He went to see Bailey and told him there were also some scheduling conflicts, which the Chief Resident couldn't resolve since she quit over the article. Bailey then appointed him Chief Resident and told him to go fix the mess his girlfriend had made. Andrew let Meredith know how mad Bailey was. In the evening, he came across Meredith in the hospital and learned she had tried to explain the situation to Bailey, which didn't go well, and that she got a summons to court since her supervisor had informed the judge that she had walked out on work crew. Andrew hated that she made a choice that could land her in jail and was actively adding to the threat of her losing her license. He wanted her to lay low, do her hours, and return to work to change the system from within. She pointed out nothing she wrote was a lie and refused to sit on her mountain of privilege and let other people fight their own battles. She grew upset and told him that if he really expected her to sit back and let people be hurt and killed by the broken system, he didn't know her at all.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nTom put Andrew on his service to get him to make Meredith make things right with Grey Sloan. He suggested withholding sex but Andrew said that wouldn't work on her. Meredith then appeared with a sick Zola and asked Tom to do a head CT. The CT revealed her shunt needed to be revised. Since she was supposed to appear before the judge that day, Andrew told Meredith he would keep an eye out for Zola so she could go, which angered her. He also offered to sit with Meredith during the surgery but she also hated that he was offering to skip out on surgeries in his residency just to be her human tissue. The surgery went well and Meredith had him to stay with Zola in post-op. In the evening, she ran into him when she went out to look for Jello for her daughter. Andrew had anticipated that request and handed her a cup. Meredith's lawyer then came up and informed them that she would have to make up the hours she skipped out on community service in jail.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, while Meredith was in jail, Andrew came to pick up the kids to drive them to school. He wanted to help Zola out with her costume wings but she rejected his help, telling him he was not her father. While working together with Jackson, Jackson inquired about Meredith. Andrew admitted he didn't really know how she was doing as her eight allowed minutes of phone time mostly went to him telling her about her kids. He explained he was helping out and told him about Zola's reaction. Jackson said that with kids, there's almost always a reason for such behavior. During rounds, Maggie came to drop off Zola with him as she had a surgery and Zola was refusing to go to daycare. Zola read her book while Andrew rounded on his patients but eventually discovered that she has disappeared from her chair. He found her in the gallery and asked her if he did anything wrong that morning. She didn't like it when people touched her wings because her dad fixed them before he died. She admitted she was scared she was going to forget him. Andrew assured her that wouldn't happen as Derek was such a legend that people would keep talking about him, which is how Andrew himself learned a lot about him. He told her the story of how her father had saved [[Isaac (Season )|Isaac]], which made Zola warm up to him again. They went trick-or-treating together. While they were sorting out the candy, Meredith came home from jail. He shortly greeted her while she hugged her kids, whom he took back to sorting the candy while Meredith spoke to her sisters.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew accompanied Meredith, her sisters, and Alex to the hotel for her hearing before the medical commission. Andrew was called to testify and questioned about when he had found out about the fraud. He said he hadn't until Richard did. The panel knew about his and Meredith's relationship through documentation from HR. Andrew assured them that the relationship was consensual and that Meredith hadn't forced him to keep the fraud quiet. He was also questioned about paperwork that detailed his being mistreated by attendings, including Meredith, after being assaulted by Alex. Andrew said that was ancient history and apologized to Meredith for hurting her case but she told him it was okay. During a short recess, Andrew and Meredith sat down and she told him their relationship wouldn't survive if she were to lose her license while he would still get to cut. Andrew followed the hearing, which ended with Meredith getting to keep her license. Andrew briefly hugged her but then disappeared as she turned to her other colleagues. He visited her at home and asked to talk. She apologized to him for what she had said but he knew she had meant it. He told her he stood up for her in court and the hospital and went to jail for her because he loved her. The whole experience made him realize that she didn't see him as her partner. When she talked about Derek in that hearing, he finally understood a feeling he had been having for a while, which was that she loved Derek but respected him, too. Meredith said she respected Andrew as well but he knew some part of her wasn't sure if he would ever be on her level. He told her to take some time to figure out what she wanted and whether he was part of that or not.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nOn her first day back, Andrew was surprised to see her. She told him she had wanted to tell him Bailey had re-hired her but he had been too busy dumping her. He said he didn't dump her but she said it was all the same to her. Together with all the other residents, they started rounds, during which they met [[Cormac Hayes]], the new Head of Pediatric Surgery. While scrubbing in, Andrew told Link and Nico about his inadvertent dumping of Meredith. They pointed out he wasn't her equal and might never be but, given their own relationships, they knew that that didn't mean she didn't respect him. They advised him to go find Meredith and undo what he did. He eventually found her but after watching her for a bit, he just walked off without talking to her.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nDespite multiple traumas coming in due to the car crash at Joe's bar, Tom tasked Andrew with babysitting [[Elliott Calhoun]] in the ICU. While doing that, Andrew texted Meredith asking if they could talk later. Elliott's heart then started beating again. Andrew went to find Teddy, who told him to prep Elliott and then she'd join him to take Elliott off ECMO. That went well and Elliott's wife thanked Andrew for saving her husband, though Andrew acknowledged it wasn't actually his doing. Andrew then visited Maggie at home to let her know that Elliott had made it through. She was relieved to hear that. Andrew then asked her for advice on how to deal with issues with Meredith as he meant some of the things of he had said but he realized that asking her to take time was wrong. Maggie only said he had hurt a woman who had been hurt more than enough for a lifetime. Andrew then stood there as she was served with a lawsuit over Sabi's death.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith came to find Andrew at work and told him she missed him. He reminded her he hadn't broken up with her so she didn't have to miss him. He then told her that [[Suzanne Britland]], his post-op appy patient was inexplicably running fevers. She told him she'd think about it but advised him to take it up to Bailey. They did scans that confirmed Andrew didn't make a mistake during his surgery but didn't give them any pointers as to why Suzanne had also suddenly developed a cardiac tamponade. As they were clueless, Bailey instructed Andrew to create a war room and gather all the people who could help them. Meredith found him there and had him talk her through the entire case.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThey reconciled while working together closely and Andrew spent the night at her place. Whilst making out with her in the morning, Andrew was paged because Suzanne had been transferred to the CCU. He told her he had used her name to lure [[Lauren Riley]], a diagnostics genius from San Francisco, to help them on the case. Andrew wanted to talk about the status of their relationship but Meredith wanted him to get to Suzanne first. Andrew pressured the residents to work on the case and visited Suzanne, who had found Meredith's hospital from hell article. After Andrew explained the situation, Lauren Riley arrived and explained her method of starting over from the beginning. Outside, Lauren asked Andrew to get Meredith. He claimed she was in surgery but Maggie pointed out she was standing nearby. Meredith's puzzled reaction made Lauren realize that she had been lied to. Andrew begged her to stay, which worked. He watched closely as Maggie, on her first day back, operated on Suzanne. After the surgery, Lauren recommended withdrawing all medication to see if certain symptoms had been masked. She and Andrew presented their idea to Suzanne whilst underlining that Lauren was the best at what she does, with Lauren sharing a story of her own three sisters to ease Hadley and Suzanne's concerns about the hospital. Suzanne then consented. Outside the room, Lauren confessed to Andrew that she was an only child and had lied with ease to get Suzanne to consent.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nAs Suzanne's condition worsened over the next three days, Andrew began to question the approach but Lauren insisted. Determined to end Suzanne's suffering, Andrew rudely interrupted a conversation between Meredith and Cormac to ask her about a certain patient from the past with some similar symptoms to Suzanne's. Cormac pointed out his rudeness and left. Both Carina and Meredith noticed how fast Andrew was talking as he explained his query. Concerned, they asked when he had slept last, which he refused to answer to. Lauren then came to inform him the pericardial biopsy came back negative for carcinomatosis. Meredith questioned their progress but Lauren said every diagnosis ruled out was progress. Meredith then pointed out that Andrew was fried and appeared obsessed. Lauren said he knew the case inside out and she was relying on his being obsessed. Suzanne began bleeding from her mouth and Andrew saw that all her blood cell counts had gone down. While performing a bone marrow biopsy, Lauren asked Andrew if he was still sleeping with Meredith. She had observed the way they argued, which made her figure it out. He confessed that he wasn't sure but Lauren said it explained her concern over his wellbeing. Soon after, Bailey called Andrew into her office to inform him that Meredith was taking over Suzanne's case, with the first step being putting her back on her meds. Andrew began objecting, stating he hadn't made any mistakes, but Bailey cut him off before he could say something he would regret later. Just as Lauren was packing up her stuff, with all of her progress being undone, the results of the biopsy came back, which made Lauren diagnose Still's disease. They rushed to her room and injected steroids into Suzanne's IV without informing Meredith of what they were doing. Meredith asked Andrew for a word outside but he ignored her and left.\n\nIt turned out they were right and Suzanne soon felt better. Meredith told Andrew to go into her room so they could thank him, but he snapped that she could go in and take the credit for her patient. He said he saved Suzanne's life no thanks to her. Meredith pointed out his career would have been over if he had been wrong after what he pulled. He asked if she would have given permission. She admitted she would have asked some questions because she didn't think he was in the right state of mind to make life-or-death decision. Andrew insisted it was the right decision. As she said he wasn't acting like himself, he yelled that she was a hypocrite as she never followed rules herself. Having overheard his outburst, Cormac stepped in to stand up for Meredith. Andrew went on to say how he had saved Suzanne's life against all odds. Meredith pointed out he was sounding like his father and told him to get some sleep. Andrew then said he didn't need any of this nor Meredith, so they were done. He walked off to go watch Suzanne being reunited with her kids.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAs a blizzard raged over Seattle, Andrew overheard that one of Cormac's patients couldn't get their liver transplant because the liver couldn't be transferred from Seattle Pres to Grey Sloan. Andrew said he would personally get the liver. Meredith tried to talk him out of it, pointing out people were freezing to death, but he brushed it off, saying he was used to the cold. He expected her to bring up his father again and left, going out into the cold to retrieve the liver. He eventually returned with the liver, which he delivered straight to the OR, with frostbitten fingers. Against his wishes, Andrew was brought to a treatment room where Jackson started working on his hands while Andrew and Carina argued over his careless behavior. Andrew wanted to go treat patients but Jackson pointed out he would lose his hands and career if he didn't stay for treatment. Jackson did his best and said the next twelve hours were critical. Carina and Meredith came to his room. Meredith said the child made it. He aggressively said she would be dead if Meredith had had things her way. Carina said they were worried about him. Carina said this was just like when their father started showing symptoms, at the same age as Andrew was now. Andrew's response was throwing Meredith out of his room.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nAt odds with Meredith yet again, Andrew had to sit through mandatory therapy with [[Cynthia Cole]], who had to sign off on him before he could operate again. During the session, he insisted he didn't need to be there and denied having experienced any symptoms of mania. He claimed he had just had a stressful couple of weeks but that his behavior had only saved patients' lives. After the session, he went to the ER and fixed the overflow. With Richard having given up his service, he thought that he could help out, but Bailey still forbade him from treating patients. After work, Andrew ran into Jo at the bar and offered her a drink. He suggested that since they were both single now, they could have sex. She threw her drink in his face and told him to get help.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew examined a teenage patient who came into the clinic under the name [[Erin Banks|Cindy Wright]] with her aunt [[Opal]]. He began to suspect that the \"aunt\" was really a human trafficker due to her always answering questions for the girl and never leaving her side. He brought his concerns to Dr. Bailey who doubted him due to his deteriorating mental health but she still visited the patient herself. She didn't find any cause for concern and took Andrew off the case, telling him to meet her in her office the next morning. However, Andrew was not convinced and took \"Cindy\" up to the surgical floor, where family members are not allowed.\n\nEventually, Andrew and the unsuspecting patient made their way to the waiting room, where a crowd formed as he stood between Opal and Cindy to keep them apart. He frantically asked for security to detain Opal but Dr. Bailey stopped them and Carina begged for him to stop his behavior. He called for everyone to follow protocol and make a human chain around Opal, but instead they exchanged sad looks and formed the chain around him. Opal and Cindy rushed together and comforted each other as Andrew stood on a chair and yelled that Opal was selling people and their affection was a trauma bond, not love. Dr. Bailey tells Andrew to go with security or he will be banned from the hospital, causing him to break down as he realized that no one supported his belief. He went with them and quit his job instead of accepting the suspension that Bailey gave him. Meredith followed him into a stairwell after seeing Dr. Bailey chase after him. He told Meredith that the more he tries to accomplish the impossible and change people's lives, the more he's judged and called crazy. She comforted him and begged for him to take the suspension instead of quitting. They made an agreement that he would as long as Dr. Bailey would call the national trafficking hotline to have them investigate Opal.\n\nShortly afterward, Opal forcefully escorted Cindy out of the emergency room undetected. She thought Cindy said something to Andrew, but Cindy insisted she didn't. Unaware of the pair being gone, Dr. Bailey called the hotline and they told her not to scare Opal off. However, since she had already left, all Dr. Bailey and Meredith could do was hope that Andrew wasn't right.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nDespite being placed on leave, Andrew returned unofficially to help diagnose Richard after his public meltdown at a conference. Andrew barely slept during the weeks he researched possible causes with Meredith. He prevented Catherine from her attempt to take Richard home and rushed into the OR when Dr. Bailey was preparing to conduct Richard's nerve biopsy. She tried to kick him out of the room but he knocked over her instrument tray and convinced her to test Richard's blood for cobalt poisoning because of a past hip replacement that could be deteriorating. Andrew's diagnosis was correct and he was allowed to scrub in (but not touch Richard) after Meredith reminded Dr. Bailey that the major save was because of him.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Andrew entered a severe depressive state. Despite this, he managed to visit Cindy when she came back to the hospital in a worse condition, this time without Opal. He was right about her being a victim of human trafficking and he was the only one she would trust. Andrew comforted her and stayed with her, eventually learning that her real name is Erin Banks. The doctors called the police and informed them. Andrew's depressive episode continued and Richard, Meredith, Bailey, and Carina staged an intervention with the support of his psychiatrist. After being defensive for a moment, he broke down and said his one goal in life was to not end up like his father. He admitted he was not okay but did not know what to do and the group got him to agree to going on medication to help manage his condition.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> He worked on his mental health after the intervention and his relationships with the group improved, eventually getting involved with Meredith's COVID- treatment and supporting Dr. Bailey after her mother's death.\n\nOpal returned to the hospital during the pandemic to check on an accomplice of hers who had been arrested and brought to the hospital after a botched trafficking scheme. Unaware of who she was, Levi noticed her and examined her when she claimed she had been mugged. He brought a police officer to take her statement on the mugging so she made up a story. She left shortly afterward due to the risk of being at Grey-Sloan. Andrew spotted her in the parking lot and enlisted the help of Carina in following Opal so he would not lose her again.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nWhile trailing Opal through Seattle,  Andrew was stabbed by an unknown assailant. Opal and the attacker were arrested as Andrew was rushed to Grey-Sloan, where he was treated in surgery by Hunt, Altman, and [[Reza Khan|Khan]]. During this time, Andrew was on the beach with Meredith in her dream sequence, where they were able to share some moments together. He told her that he didn't regret following Opal because we go through life ignoring atrocities all the time, but it makes sense to fight for people. Back in the real world, he woke up and Carina told him that the traffickers were arrested so he saved a lot of kids but she was still mad at him. Though the initial surgery was a success, Andrew later suffered a cardiac tamponade and went into DIC, resulting in the need for him to return to surgery. Meanwhile, Meredith and Andrew saw a woman calling to Andrew on the beach: his deceased mother. Andrew said he needed to go and Meredith told him that she would miss him. He ran off to reunite with his mother. At the same time, Khan told Altman, Hunt, and the rest of the surgical team that Andrew\us heart would not restart as he had already been down for forty minutes. They reluctantly stopped and Andrew flatlined. Khan asked if anyone was going to call time of death but was met only with silence and heartbroken looks. He called time of death as :, and Andrew and his mother walked away on the beach, arm in arm.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew was very confident and easygoing. He had a strong emotional and soft side, especially when it came to romantic relationships. Sometimes he could make very irrational decisions.\n\n\n\n[[Maggie Pierce]]\nAfter not being able to save one of the twins, Andrew ended up at the bar getting drunk with Maggie. She kissed him, and they ended up sleeping together.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref> The next day, she avoided him and then told him that it wouldn't be happening again. Despite this, they began kissing and had sex again.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie and Andrew at Joe's bar]]After they had sex, Maggie had the repeated, urgent need to urinate, so she came back to the hospital. Because OB was understaffed, Andrew came in to examine her. She believed he may have given her an STI. After her exam, she and Andrew talked about how he didn't automatically assume that she gave him something, so she shouldn't automatically assume he gave her something and he said that she could get the test results later, but if she wanted to know anything about his history, she could ask or she could just trust him.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew touched her affectionately while working on a case, Maggie told him he couldn't do that anymore. They needed to keep it professional at work. She admitted to having feelings for him and asked if he could keep it professional at work. He said he could.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen an ambulance exploded in the ER, Maggie repeatedly paged Andrew. He found her and told her she needed to stop paging him so much, but she admitted she was worried about him, believing he'd been in the blast.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after they went public, Andrew became uncomfortable with the way things changed when people knew he was seeing an attending and he started to avoid her. When she confronted him, he ended things with her.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Sam Bello]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Sam and Andrew at a hospital party]]While the details of Andrew and Sam's relationship are unknown, it is known that they had a very complicated, on-and-off relationship for years. The first time they broke up, he stayed on his sister Carina's couch for weeks. He seemed to dislike having Sam in Seattle and tried his best to ignore and avoid her. After she assured him that she didn't come to Seattle for him, they ended up having sex in an on-call room, despite knowing their relationship wasn't good for either of them.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref> [[Jo Wilson]] and [[Alex Karev]] discuss that Andrew and Sam continued to do this every day.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> \n\nThey eventually moved in together as their relationship grew more serious. However, when Sam was discovered by ICE and was in risk of deportation, she decided to continue her medical career in Switzerland under [[Cristina Yang]] and left the country.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref> After Andrew and Sam broke up, Andrew went to Meredith Grey's house and stayed on the couch, not able to get over Sam. At Jo and Alex's wedding, he got drunk out of misery, leading him to kiss Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew drunkenly kissed Meredith, and she rejected his advances, though she said she was flattered. The next day, Andrew remembered what he did and apologized to Meredith, who, unbeknownst to Andrew, was having sex dreams about him. Andrew soon realized he had feelings for Meredith and tried to keep them in tact while she began dating other people with the help of her matchmaker patient. However, during the superstorm, when Andrew saw that Meredith might start dating [[Atticus Lincoln]], he confessed his feelings for her. Meredith told him she had to think about it, but that same day, they got trapped in the elevator, where they learn more about each other, such as that they both speak Italian. They almost kissed until the elevator began working again.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith and Andrew at Catherine's party]]Now that Meredith was fully aware of Andrew's feelings for her, Andrew began to pursue Meredith in competition with her other suitor, Link. Though Meredith initially tried to resist her interest in Andrew by setting up a date with Link, she eventually chose Andrew to be with, and they shared their first kiss on the hospital roof on Valentine's Day. After getting Maggie's approval, Meredith allowed Andrew to take her out on a date, starting their relationship officially.\n\nWhen operating with Richard on a woman's appendectomy, Andrew told him that, while he and Meredith hadn't had any serious conversations about their future yet, she makes him so happy, earning him Richard's approval on the relationship. After Zola caught Andrew trying to sneak out of Meredith's room in the middle of the night, Meredith asked Andrew if he even liked kids, to which he responded that he has sixteen cousins and that her kids might like him more than her. That night, Meredith told her kids about her relationship with Andrew, which they warmly welcomed.\n\nAfter watching Meredith commit insurance fraud for Gabby Rivera's case, Andrew didn't say anything, but looked like he disapproved as they operated on Gabby. Later that day, Meredith told him that she could not apologize for her actions, as she did them to save a family. Andrew told Meredith that she had it all wrong; he was silent because he was in awe of what she did and that he was worried he would accidentally blurt out that he loves her. Though Meredith didn't say it back at first, she eventually told him she loves him too after he took the fall for the insurance fraud and landed himself in jail.\n\nAfter Meredith's trial, he told her that he saw the way she talked about Derek, and said that she didn't just love Derek, she respected him. Meredith said he couldn't compare the two, but Andrew told her to take some time.\n\nWhen Andrew drove himself sleepless from a patient, Suzanne, Carina voiced her concerns to Meredith that he might have the same mania as their father. Meredith took over Suzanne's case and didn't agree with Andrew's course of treatment. However, his treatment led to the discovery of Suzanne having Still's disease. Andrew was angry with Meredith, since if they had followed her idea, they'd never have diagnosed Suzanne. During their fight, Meredith told him he was acting like his father. This only angered Andrew further, and he ended up breaking up with Meredith completely.\n\n\n[[Carina DeLuca]]\nAt a young age, he and his mother moved to the United States while his sister, Carina, stayed behind in Italy with their father. Carina came to Seattle to do research about the female orgasm and discovered Amelia's brain tumor. While in Seattle, Carina also served as OB/GYN when needed.\n\n[[Vincenzo DeLuca]]\nAndrew and his father have a complicated relationship. Vincenzo took him and his sister out on fishing trips, took him on trips on the back of his motorcycle, and taught him how to play soccer and the names of the stars. However, Vincenzo also killed four people while operating in a manic state and never took responsibility for it as he got away with it because of his connections.\n\nAfter Catherine's party, just as Andrew was about to show Meredith his apartment, Carina returned to America with Vincenzo, who was here to propose research for an external womb to the hospital. While Carina didn't trust their father's mental state, Andrew signed on to work on the project after Vincenzo told him this would put him on the map. However, Vincenzo's manic symptoms started to show when the project started failing, leading him to offer the incomplete research to a hospital patient. Andrew had an emotional confrontation with Vincenzo, the project was shut down, and Vincenzo returned to Italy.\n\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nOne evening, Jo was drunk and Andrew took her home. Jo confessed that she couldn't marry Alex because she was already married. When Alex came home, he saw Andrew on top of Jo and thought Andrew was attempting to assault her. Andrew tried to defend himself, but Alex repeatedly punched Andrew. Shortly afterward, Alex was arrested for the assault while Andrew was treated at the hospital. In the aftermath of Alex's arrest, Andrew and Jo bonded because they weren't allowed to speak to others about the trial. When Jo learned that she had to testify, she worried that she would have to talk about her husband. Not wanting to put her through that trouble, Andrew told the DA he'd refuse to cooperate, forcing them to drop the charges against Alex.\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nHe got off to a bad start with Alex, who mistakenly believed Andrew hated kids because he didn't want to work in peds.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref> He was later attacked by Alex at Alex and Jo's apartment because Alex saw him on top of Jo when she was drunk.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> While Alex awaited trial for assault, the two avoided each other. The night before Alex's trial, he decided to take a plea deal to get two years, but before he could do so, Andrew came in and told the DA he wanted to drop the charges. When the DA said it wasn't his case to drop, Andrew said he'd say that it was all a misunderstanding that got out of hand, tanking the DA's case.<ref>[[Jukebox Hero]], x</ref> Alex later apologized to Andrew for what happened, which is what Andrew wanted in the first place.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref> When they had to work together, Alex asked if they were cool and Andrew assured him that they were.<ref>[[Civil War]], x</ref>\n\n\nAndrew was an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\nHe was chosen as the new [[Resident#Chief Resident|Chief Resident]] after there was a walkout of doctors in support of [[Meredith Grey]]. He decided to go to medical school after working as an EMT after high school. After a year as a surgical intern, he passed his intern exam and became a [[Resident|resident]]. Subsequently, he has been described by his superiors as one of the star residents of the hospital.\n\n\n*He played the guitar.\n*He said he had a lot of trouble getting to the second date because his first dates usually ended in sex and then women seemed to assume he had moved on.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n*Andrew didn't know baseball.\n*Andrew was Italian and spoke Italian, like [[Giacomo Gianniotti]] himself.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n*Andrew's given name is Andrea.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n*During his hospitalization for his assault, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] said his mother knew her and that she was probably at work.

She'd had two prior open-heart surgeries and made a trip with her family from Boston to Seattle for a third. Her condition made it unsafe for her to fly on a commercial airplane, so her parents used a crowdfunding website to raise money, which they used to get an RV and drive across the country. On the way, they stopped at several tourist attractions. By the time they reached Seattle, Fernanda was starting to feel dizzy, so they rushed her directly to the PICU. She was dehydrated, so they gave her fluids and ordered more tests, which showed that her aortic stenosis had gotten worse and they were forced to covert to a Ross-Konno Procedure. It carried additional risk, but her parents agreed to it because Maggie said it was the best option.

He says the worst part of it was seeing his mother so sad all the time.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref> At the age of ten, he got a wish granted. For his wish, he asked for a baseball game at Shea Stadium. He loved it and discovered a great pizza place in Manhattan where he ate five times. It was the last trip before his parents got divorced.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after that trip, his parents sat him down and told him that their family was a lie and they would be getting a divorce. The divorce was tough on him as they used him as a pawn and forced him to choose sides. He spent Christmas days on an airplane so he could have breakfast with his father and dinner with his mother. He double-majored in college so they could go to separate graduation ceremonies. The only thing that remained was the tradition of their all having lunch together on his cancer-versary, the day he was declared cancer-free. It took him years to manage parents who could barely make it through one lunch without tearing each other apart.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen [[Nisha]] came into the ER with a bike attached to her after being hit by a car, Link took her as his first case at Grey Sloan Memorial.

He then took her into surgery to put an external fixator on her broken leg.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nLink was later angry to learn that Jackson had taken Nisha into the hyperbaric chamber without notifying him. Link watched as Jackson worked on debriding her wound. When Nisha started coding, he figured out that the source was her external fixator, to which the infection had spread. Unfortunately, it was too late and Nisha died in the hyperbaric chamber.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nLink had the idea to make custom prosthetics with superhero themes for kids, but he needed a better -D printer which cost $, to get. He made his proposal to Alex, who approved it quickly. When [[Dave Buckley]] came into the ER with partially amputated fingers, Link examined him and then took him to the OR to amputate two of his fingers that weren't salvageable.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith showed up to work dressed up for her lunch date, Link was awed by her look.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson brought [[Rafi Elshami]] to the hospital to have surgery on tumors in his scapulae, Link scrubbed in on the surgery. When they found cancer, they planned to remove his scapulae in their entirety to save his life until Jackson had the idea to remove them, use radiation to kill the cancer, and then replace them, maintaining his quality of life. The surgery went well and Rafi's father was told he'd be okay.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\n[[J.J. Williams]] came into the ER with a broken arm after trying to climb a fence. When they did an x-ray to confirm, they saw a mass on his arm. They biopsied the mass and learned it was an osteosarcoma. Link assured J.J. and his mother that they caught it early and they'd develop a treatment plan for him. J.J. was worried about losing his hair, which Link said happened to him when he had the same cancer in his thigh as a child, so Link started cutting his own hair off and gave the scissors to J.J. to help.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nLink came to treat [[Georgia]] in the ER. She had a cut on her hand, so he checked her nerve function and said she looked good.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the wind storm, the power went out, trapping people in elevators. However, when the power came back, the elevators did not immediately start working again. Dahlia and Jackson found the elevator where [[Phoebe Moss]] was trapped with Bailey and Taryn and, with Link's help, started trying to get the elevator open. [[Jed Lundberg]] tried to stop them until he learned that the elevator contained organs for Cece. He then helped them get the trapped people out. After they were out, he tried to haul himself out, but before he completely cleared the elevator shaft, the elevator started working again and came down on his legs. They were able to get him free with his legs still attached. Link and Jackson operated and found a way to let him keep both his legs. After his surgery, Jed had nerve function in his foot, which was a sign the surgery worked.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nLink worked on the case of [[Natasha Deon]], who had fallen three floors from a hotel balcony. He confused Meredith when he decided not to stabilize her pelvis before taking her into the OR. When they got in there, he showed her why not stabilizing the pelvis would give a better outcome. He put in an external fixator and Natasha was put into a medically-induced coma after her surgery to help her recover.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nWhen he learned that the entertainment Meredith had hired for Bailey's birthday party had cancelled and Alex backed out of helping, he offered to help set up, saying he loved superheroes, the theme of the party. They set up the party quickly and Bailey was happy when he saw what they'd done. When he saw Link, Bailey asked if he was Thor and Link played along. While the party was winding down, Link sat in the kitchen with Meredith, talking and eating birthday cake.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the mass overdose, Link treated a patient in the ER who had broken both arms before moving to the clinic, checking on patients. When Betty started having chest pains, he picked her up and carried her over to the main hospital. He then put an IV into [[Linus]] to give him fluids because he had become seriously dehydrated. However, Link later found Linus in a closet with a needle in his arms. He and Amelia tried to save Linus, but were unsuccessful. Link expressed his regret to Amelia for leaving Linus unattended.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nLink was working on [[Hunter Martinez]], who had osteosarcoma in his right femur. After three months of chemotherapy, he was ready to have a rotationplasty, to remove the cancerous portion of his leg and flip the lower part of his leg to make his ankle his knee. The surgery was successful and they were hopeful that he'd be able to continue to play baseball.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\n\nLink went to the Western States Conference for Alternative Pain Relief. He was one of the presenters and talked about an athlete he treated who became addicted to opioids and later died in a car accident under the influence. Link knew he was the kid's first dealer. Despite this, he said he'd do the same thing. Amelia, who was attending his talk, walked out after hearing that. He continued and later went to her room to explain to her that he needed to prescribe the kid opioids immediately after surgery, but it should have stopped there. And he should have talked to him and his mother about the risk of becoming addicted and that's where he went wrong. The guilt over what he did caused him to quit medicine for a whole year. He came back to make it right.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nWith Amelia, Link treated [[Kari Donnelly]], who'd been in a bad accident. There was a risk of paralysis, but they believed they could prevent that. They took her into surgery and had almost finished the repair when they lost signal to all four of her limbs. They were unable to restore function and had to tell her child that she would be quadriplegic.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Link found a study that involved directly injecting stem cells into the spines of quadraplegic patients in the hopes of regaining use of their arms. He suggested this treatment for Kari, who agreed to try it.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nAfter learning from Alex that Jo had been acting different since returning from seeing [[Vicki Ann Rudin|her birth mother]], Link went to their loft to figure out what was wrong with Jo. He was able to get her to laugh and joke about their past, but when Alex came home at the end of the day, he told Alex that something was really wrong.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nLink went to New York with Amelia to operate on [[Jonah Mays]]. During their trip, they ended up having dinner with Amelia's sisters, Nancy and Kathleen, and Link tried to pass as Owen, but they were found out when their mother, who had met Owen before, arrived. Amelia and Link then left. Amelia was upset with Link knowing so much about her past, but she apologized on their flight home and they shared donuts.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n\nLink and Amelia continued seeing each other until Link realized Amelia was still hiding him from her sisters. He asked her where she saw their relationship going, as he was all in.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref> After taking some time to think, Amelia told him that she needed some time to discover who she is outside of Owen, but that Link could possibly have a place in her future.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAlex informed Link that Jo had been committed to the psychiatric department for her depressive episode. They went out for drinks and Link assured a fearful Alex that Jo was strong and that she would come out fine. He then told Alex about his break-up with Amelia. Later in surgery, Amelia noticed he misunderstood her and explained in surgery that she was just trying to put a stop to her habit of going all in too fast. She did want to continue dating him to get to know him. On a date, Amelia shared that she would like to try a threeway. He was surprised she'd never done that in L.A. as he had plenty there. Over time, they talked it over and Link consented to her going to ask Carina for a threeway.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia followed Link into a staircase and asked him to go somewhere private. He expected sex or bad news, like her seeing someone else, but instead, she blurted out that she was eight weeks pregnant with his baby. She said she didn't expect anything from him but just didn't want to keep it a secret. She also hinted at her bad track record with pregnancy but was paged away for a trauma before she could elaborate. Link was baffled and found a quiet place to process. Jo joined him and he told her. He said he hated his own childhood with the cancer and his parents' divorce. While Jo assured him that wouldn't happen to his kid since his cancer wasn't genetic, he said worrying about random cancer was even worse. He was also afraid about brining a kid into this terrible world with global warming. He wasn't sure if he'd get a say. Jo said it was Amelia's choice in the end but he for sure would get to weigh in and assured him he would be a great father. He then received word Amelia wanted to talk and went to find her in the green room. She opened up to him about her experiences with [[Christopher Shepherd|Christopher]] and how terrified it made her of pregnancy. He then told her that her experience made his imagined worst-case scenarios seem irrelevant and that the most important thing to him now was that she wouldn't get hurt. He said he's suck up his fears and be a dad if she decided to keep it or support her in any way possible if she didn't. She then abruptly left. He later found her on a bench outside and she told him his words had made her less scared and a little bit in love with him, which she attributed to the hormones. She then said she thought they would make an amazing kid and that she would like to meet it. He agreed with her.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia initially decided that she wasn't ready to tell anyone yet, but after witnessing the reunion of long lost lovers [[Bertram Hollister]] and [[Soyoung Oh]], she decided that, while it scared, the pregnancy was a good thing and she wanted to share it with their friends and family with him. Together, they went to Meredith's house to deliver the news and Meredith and Andrew congratulated them.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Link was part of the team that treated a woman who got severely injured when the frozen body of a stowaway fell from the sky and landed on her. Link in particular took care of the woman's boyfriend, who was panicking as the frozen body had basically exploded in front of him on top of his girlfriend, covering him in blood. While Link was calming him down, the man found a toe in his hood. Afterwards, he went to assist Maggie and Teddy in the OR but by the time he was scrubbed, Alicia had been pronounced dead. Link delivered the news to Josh and comforted him. He took the news pretty hard. At Amelia's, he had her lie on top of him as a gravity-blanket. He told her he was falling in love with her. While he had always associated love with pain and divorce, he liked the feeling he was having and since people were being killed by bodies falling from the sky, there was no point in trying to avoid pain. Together, they continued to lie there with their hands on her belly.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, his cancer-versary, he invited Amelia to his annual cancer-versary brunch with his parents. While they usually ruined it with arguments about whose life turned out better after the divorce, he was planning on breaking that pattern by telling them about the pregnancy. He introduced his parents to Amelia upon arrival as they didn't know that he was seeing anyone until a few hours before. Amelia said they've been seeing each other for a few months. Link said they had known each other for longer. Amelia blurted out the entire history of how they came to be together, all the way back to Maggie setting them up and her split from Owen after the ordeal with Betty and Leo. While a bit overwhelmed, Maureen understood how things could work out better the second time around. She then announced that she was getting re-married to Link's father Eric. Link was baffled. Link found out they reconnected when his father moved to Denver for work and was matched with Maureen on multiple dating apps. They laughed about it at first but then came together again. Eric asked Link to be his best man but Link scoffed and said their divorce put him through hell. He didn't know what to say but he was sure he was never going to do what they did to him to his own kid. After dropping the pregnancy bomb, he went to get some air. Amelia joined him outside and made him realize he was mostly angry at his parents for making his cancer-versary all about them. She said they could go if he wanted to or go back inside to give his parents a chance to do better. Link opted for the latter. Over dessert, his parents suggested they get married, too, but they wanted to focus on the baby. When Link mentioned they had a lot to plan before next Spring, his parents asked when exactly Amelia was due at they had put down a deposit for a venue in April. Link grew upset but his parents were willing to forfeit it. After lunch, Amelia took Link home to de-stress and presented him with an improvised cake made up out of candy bars.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nLink attended Meredith's hearing with the medical commission. When [[Paul Castello]] had a seizure there, Link and Teddy drove to the hospital to assist Amelia on the case. They took scans and diagnosed a brain bleed. Tom took on the case as Amelia didn't trust herself to operate on the man who had killed her brother. She and Link sat in the gallery as she confided in him that she had dreamt about sticking a scalpel in that man's brain. He passed away on the table before their eyes. Amelia couldn't hide her joy. He drove her back to the hotel where the hearing was and they announced the news to the other doctors. When news broke that Meredith would get to keep her license, Link congratulated her.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia's hormones increased her libido, which Link liked. Before surgery, Link learned Jo had volunteered to become a Safe Haven volunteer and wondered if that was too much too soon. She asked him to accompany her to Station  for her first-ever call but he had surgery. He offered to cancel but she declined the offer. Later, he learned Amelia hadn't had an ultrasound yet, which surprised him as he wanted to find out everything they could. While scrubbing in, he learned about Andrew's inadvertent dumping of Meredith and pointed out Andrew wasn't Meredith's equal but that didn't mean she didn't respect him. Link advised him to go set the record straight. After work, he went by Jo's place and found out she had brought the baby home. She admitted it was probably too much too soon after all.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nLink was pacing when Meredith arrived to complain to Alex about Cormac. He pointed out Jo had stolen a baby. When they were paged for trauma, they agreed Jo could sneak the baby into the nursery for a check-up and pretend he had been there all night like he was supposed to. At work, Link asked Amelia about the ultrasound and she told him the baby was healthy. Link fixed [[Taryn Helm|Taryn's]] tib-fib fracture that she sustained in the accident at Joe's bar. After the surgery, he met up with Jo in the nursery as she handed the baby over to the social worker. Jo admitted she had fallen in love with that baby a bit. He understood as he had fallen in love with his unborn child, too. Link invited her to come hang out with his kid whenever she felt like it. Later, Amelia told him she had something serious to tell him but they were interrupted by Owen and Teddy announcing their engagement. Amelia then told him they were having a boy. Link was delighted and said he wanted the name Scout in the mix.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, soon after, Amelia broke the news to him that it was possible that not he but Owen was the father of the baby. She assured him she wanted to be with Link and a paternity test wouldn't change that, which is why she told him first. She told him she loved what they had and gave him some time to think things through. He informed Jo of the situation and added it didn't change anything as Amelia didn't want a paternity test anyway. Jo was shocked and called him out on his attitude, stating he could love Amelia and be mad at her at the same time. While they were removing a swallowed fish from a man's throat, Link defended the patient, stating maybe the happy situation of the bachelor party they were celebrating caused the man to do something that didn't seem normal. Jackson pointed out even in good situations, there are things that are not okay. Link then realized he was right and decided he did want a paternity test. He paged Amelia to the plant room and told her that as well as the fact that she should have told him right away. She admitted he was right and apologized for hurting him. She asked what would happen if they were to find out he wasn't the father. He replied he would like to be the guy who said it wouldn't matter but he couldn't promise her that. He suggested they get the test and take it one step at a time.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThey agreed to meet in the plant room to discuss the paternity test results. She showed up and told him they would get the results that night. He still didn't know what the results would mean for them, specifically what if the baby were to be Owen's and if he would still want to be with her. He told her he was afraid her complicated history with Owen would shape their future. He told her he loved her but repeated that he needed to know the results. That night, he waited for her in that room again but he only received a text that she didn't get the test and needed more time.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nLink was worried as she took a couple of days off work and ignored his texts. Jo was going through something similar as Alex was not answering her texts while going through something with his family in Iowa. Link assured her he would tell her what was going on as soon as he was ready. Jo then informed him Amelia did something similar back when she was having a fight with Owen over having kids. Link ended up on an elevator with Owen, who commented on Amelia missing work. Link told him that the baby was healthy but things were complicated. Owen recalled feeling useless during Teddy's pregnancy and told him all he could do was listen and sympathize and keep trying to help. Link decided to seek out Amelia at home. Maggie answered the door and denied that Amelia was home though she assured him Amelia was okay. He asked why Amelia was hiding the results from him so Maggie clarified Amelia didn't know the results. Amelia then came downstairs and said she wasn't doing the test because she wanted to raise her baby with someone who would love him and her no matter what a blood test said, like her sisters. She told Link they were over and sent him home. He asked Maggie if Amelia would inform Owen, which Maggie didn't think she would. Baffled, Link walked away.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nLink let himself go and stopped shaving, though he did continue to show up for work. He made a comment to Maggie about Amelia in front of Teddy, which made her suspicious. After work, Link went to offer Jo some company and doughnuts. She was disappointed to see him as she had been expecting Alex. She told him she had called [[Helen Karev|Helen]] and found out that Alex never went to Iowa. As she broke down, she said she truly believed Alex had left. Link comforted her.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref> She moved in with him as she couldn't bear to be in the loft by herself. He went to pick up some of her stuff and found a letter from Alex in the mail. He brought it to her at the hospital and offered to sit with her as she read it, which she turned down. He returned to the lounge when she finished reading Alex's goodbye letter. He offered to take her day drinking but she chose to work, though she planned on drinking at the bar after work. He told her she was his hero as she put on her white coat and took off for surgery.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Link and Amelia reconcile as he finds out the baby is his. ]]\nJo moved in with him as she couldn't bear to live in the loft by herself, which distracted Link from his problems with Amelia. He decided to let Amelia come to him if she wanted to talk. He and Jo ended up working a trauma case with her but she didn't talk to him about the baby. The patient's relationship caused Jo to realize that Alex had left her feeling worthy of love. She told Link not to blow things with Amelia, who at least had given him a choice, which is more than Alex gave her. Link then went to Meredith's house. He told Amelia that he wanted to write her a song but he couldn't come up with one as fast as he needed to come over to tell her that he didn't want to live without her. He was done feeling sad and lonely. He didn't care that the baby might not be his as loving her was all he cared about. She then kissed him and revealed that the baby was, in fact, his.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia informed all involved parties that the baby was Link's. At the same time, the Mariners started courting Link to take his old job back but he turned them down as all the late nights and travel would prevent him from spending time with his family. Link instead recommended Nico, which didn't sit well with Levi. During surgery, Link informed Levi what the job entailed exactly and advised Levi to tell Nico how he felt about it. That night in bed, Amelia told him that they could make it work if he wanted to take back his dream job. He told her he had new things in life that he loved more. She found it scary that dreams had to be put on hold for their kid, so they vowed to always fight for their dreams as much as possible.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nWith the due date approaching quickly, Link realized that life as he knew it would change forever. Link and Owen operate on a Lisfranc fracture together. Link admitted he was nervous that the stress caused by Amelia looking for a diagnosis for Richard would induce labor. Owen pointed out the baby would be fine regardless since they were so close to term. He also truthfully told Link that parenthood is scary and that the worries that come with it never go away. Link was paged when Amelia supposedly went into labor. He rushed to her room. She told him she, too, had realized that the birth was not the finish line at all. Together, they screamed through another contraction. However, an OB fellow informed them that she was just experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions so she was good to go home.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Link meets his son.]]\nA few days later, Link found out she had a busy schedule and suggested she take it easy. She refused. However, while working on Richard's case with her colleagues, her water broke. She walked to labor & delivery herself and had Link paged. Upon his arrival, she admitted she had ignored the contractions that had started in the morning, figuring they were Braxton-Hicks again. Carina confirmed she was in active labor and went to fetch a fetal monitor. Link then showed a bag he brought with their stuff and sat by her side. As the labor progressed, Bailey came to get Link to operate on Richard, whom they had diagnosed with cobalt poisoning from his hip prosthesis. Carina assured him Amelia still had hours to go, so he agreed to go operate. With the gallery filled up, Link removed the hip and placed a new hip. The surgery went well. Link rushed back to Amelia's room, finding her in a calm state. He briefly thought it had been false alarm again but he then saw Bailey in the room holding his son. She handed him over to Link, who sat down with him on Amelia's bed.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after the birth, Meredith came to meet her nephew while his parents debated his name. They couldn't agree on one so they started saying random names to the baby in hopes of eliciting a reaction from him that would indicate that they found the right name. Since that approach didn't work, Amelia went online and read that sometimes people pick names from their dreams. When Amelia said her last dream had been a sex dream, Link cautiously suggested revisiting the subject when she was less hormonal, causing her to throw him out of her room. Eventually, they settled on [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln]].<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle in the middle of their parental leave, Amelia and Link stayed at Meredith's house with their son and Meredith's kids, while Meredith and Maggie stayed in hotels after their shifts at the hospital in order not to risk bringing home the disease. Due the chaos of raising hungry and energetic children, Link and Amelia forgot about Link's birthday. Link himself didn't remember until his mother called while Amelia was only reminded by posts on his social media. Link said it was no big deal and got back to putting together the tent that [[Winston Ndugu]] sent for Maggie to sleep in in the backyard. Amelia told they kids that Link wanted them to watch a movie for his re-birthday, which she made up for forgetting his real one, and they went upstairs to have sex while the kids were distracted. They were interrupted by their son crying so Amelia got up to comfort him. In the evening, Amelia presented Link with a plate of doughnuts. She apologized since the store had accidentally sent over gluten-free doughnuts, but he appreciated the gesture and assured her he had had a good birthday.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Meredith had contracted COVID and was admitted to the hospital, causing Link and Amelia to look after her kids. Link was happy to get a break from parenting four kids when he was paged to the hospital for a hand trauma. Upon arrival, he ran into an exhausted Jo, who had taken over running Meredith's service. He scrubbed in to repair a sex therapist's hamate fracture. Over the procedure, they discussed the importance of sex to pass time during quarantine. After surgery, the patient shared his secret: asking for and listening to what your partner wants. Link then returned home and as he undressed in the backyard to be certain not to introduce the virus into the house, a helpless Amelia broke down crying. He asked her what she wanted. She wanted sex but didn't feel safe after he had been at the hospital. They then took off their clothes and pleasured themselves in front of another while keeping their distance.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nLink kept his calm demeanor around the house, playing guitar for the kids, while Amelia was stressed out taking over Meredith's role as a parent. Contrary to Amelia, he insisted on looking at everything from the bright side. Amelia snapped that she had had enough of his pep talks and couldn't keep shoving all her negative feelings down, stating there would be no bright side to the consequences of that. He then took the time to listen to her feelings without trying to make things better. After they put the kids down for the night, he told her that when he had cancer and his parents' divorce, he had already been through a period of illness and isolation. He then met a kid at cancer camp who refused to talk about anything cancer-related and that attitude of focusing on the good stuff only turned out to work well for him, so he couldn't be her partner in misery. She understood and asked him about the song he was composing.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref> A few days later, Amelia decided to go into work to help treat Tom, who had contracted COVID. In the process of leaving, she revealed to Link that Tom was not only her teacher but also her first sex partner post-Owen.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith's condition worsened and had to be put on a ventilator, a sleep-deprived Link and Amelia had Jackson pick up Maggie and Winston so they could tell the kids about their mother's status together. Link set them all up with beers as they settled in the backyard. Scout woke up from his nap crying so Link paced around the backyard with him to calm down. He then vented that taking care of the kids forced him and Amelia to keep moving. He admitted he had started to wonder what would become of his life if Meredith were to die, going even as far as praying every night for her survival. Jackson and Winston understood him and assured him that it was okay for some of his reasons for wanting Meredith to live to be selfish. Link added he would hate for the kids to lose their other parent and then thanked Jackson for picking up Maggie and Winston despite his history with Maggie, thus revealing that relationship to Winston. <ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\n\nBecause of his history with childhood cancer, Link does not like to have stress in his life. He prevents stress by avoiding situations that he knows will end in pain and not getting too concerned about things that are out of his control. He is very laid-back, relaxed, and supportive of his friends and loved ones. He is shown to be kind, generous, and emotionally mature.\n\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nWhile looking for the quickest route to the ER, Link met Maggie, who suggested that Amelia might be good for him. He asked Amelia to have dinner with him, but Amelia was confused and quickly declined the offer to go out with him.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Betty was in surgery, Amelia broke down sobbing and Link consoled her.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref> Soon after, Amelia attended a medical conference where she ran into Link, who was giving a lecture. They flirted with each other and Amelia even decided to check out his presentation. After hearing that he prescribed opioids to a patient who became addicted and died and would do the same thing again, Amelia got upset and left. Link continued the lecture, but visited Amelia's room afterward and told her his patient needed opioids, but where he went wrong was not telling him and his mother how addictive opioids could be and not carefully monitoring him to make sure he didn't become addicted. He said he wanted to change the system to a relieved Amelia. Amelia made a move on Link and they ended up hooking up in her hotel room. <ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> After their return, things were awkward between the two of them, even though they both vowed it was a one-time thing. However, after working together on a difficult case, they hooked up again.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nWhen they went to New York for a case, Amelia's sister, Nancy, invited them over for dinner. At dinner, Amelia lied and said that Link was her husband, Owen. Link went along with it until Amelia's mother, Carolyn, came over and called them out on their lie. When all of Amelia's sisters started criticizing her, Link stood up for Amelia. On the plane back to Seattle, Amelia apologized to Link over donuts.<ref>[[Good Shepherd]], x</ref>\n\nLink and Amelia continued seeing each other until Link realized Amelia was still hiding him from her sisters. He asked her where she saw their relationship going, as he was all in.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref> After taking some time to think, Amelia told him that she needed some time to discover who she is outside of Owen, but that Link could possibly have a place in her future.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nLink and Amelia started dating again soon after she said she wanted to know him better before committing to him seriously.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref> Weeks later, Amelia tells Link she is pregnant, and tells him about Christopher. He replies by saying it's her choice and he'll be there for her in any way he can. She decides to keep the baby.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nSeveral weeks later. Amelia finds out she's further along than she thought, sparking doubt as to the baby's paternity.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref> She tries to tell him the news, but tells him it's a boy instead, to which he replies with the name suggestion \"Scout\".<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nLink is then told by Amelia that there's a chance he may not be the father. Amelia said she loves him and wants to be with him, and that the genetics don't matter to her. Initially, Link is okay with this, but after talking with Jo, he tells Amelia that he wants a paternity test.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>.\n\nLink waits in the plant room for Amelia to come with the results. She hovers by the door before leaving. He gets a text from her that she didn't run the test and she needed more time.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nLink visited her house to see if she was okay, where he finds out she isn't planning to get the results of the paternity test, because she wants someone who will love her regardless. She then ends things with him.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> After working on [[Brad Spencer]] with Jo, Jo tells him that love doesn't suck like they think it does and that Amelia gave him a choice. He then went to Amelia's house where he professes his love to her, and how she changed him and made him want to be a parent. Amelia then kisses him and says she really needed to hear that. She then tells him she got the results, and the baby is his.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nThey had a scare when Amelia began feeling contractions, but it turned out to be Braxton-Hicks.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref> Later, her water broke, and she was actually in labor that time. Link came to her side, but he was pulled away into surgery. He arrived back at her room after the birth of the baby and sits down next to Amelia with their baby in his arms.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Link and DeLuca fight over Meredith.]]Jo encouraged Link to pursue Meredith, telling him that she's a tough nut to crack, but she's worth it.

While setting up for the party at Meredith's house, Link told her more about having cancer as a child, which gave her more insight about him.

Link apologized for not calling like he had said he would, but she assured him that it was okay and explained that she wasn't there for him and that she worked at the hospital. Later that day, Link met Jules outside the intern locker room and explained that he brought her some HR paperwork for her to sign, stating that their relationship predated her employment at Grey Sloan Memorial. Jules got confused and pointed out that they didn't have a relationship.<ref>[[Everything Has Changed]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jules got to scrub in on a below the knee amputation, she saw that Link had written messages on the patient's legs to indicate which leg to cut off. She mistook this for flirting and asked him if he was flirting with her over a sick patient's leg. Link quickly explained that he was being a supportive teacher and didn't want her to cut off the wrong leg.<ref>[[Wasn't Expecting That]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jules needed help recording sexual education videos, she found Link in the pit and asked him if he could help her, but he told her it was inappropriate and said that he didn't want anyone to think that he was harassing her.<ref>[[Let's Talk About Sex]], x</ref>\n\nBronwyn Murphy\nHe has an ex-girlfriend named Bronwyn who had red hair and a tattoo of the word Texas and another in the shape of Texas lower on her back.

Link explained that he tried to tell Jo that he didn't like Paul, but then Paul got jealous and made her stay away from him. Link didn't know about the abuse and thought he was just being respectful in staying away. Alex then started treating him better and they developed a friendship.\n\nThey went out for drinks together after Jo committed herself to the psychiatric department to have her depressive episode treated. Alex feared it wouldn't work as it had failed to help other people in his life. Link assured Alex that Jo was strong and that she'd make it through.

''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the wind storm, Betty came into the ER with a cut on her head. She openly admitted to Amelia that she was high and said she really did want to get better. Amelia was angry with her, but came to the ER, hugged her, and told her to come back always. She also decided to become Betty's foster mom officially. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nWhen Richard found Betty wandering the hospital, he said that he fights cravings by helping people and invited her to help him treat patients. When she started talking about staying clean and getting her life back on track, he advised her not to think she was cured just because she was making good progress. Later, he found her searching cabinets for drugs. He told her they were kept in a locked cabinet. Amelia later talked to Betty and said she needed to be ready to accept Amelia's help and help herself and to get her to that point, Amelia found her a bed at a rehab facility. Betty agreed to have Amelia drive her there. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Owen and Amelia went to visit Betty in rehab, Betty said that one of the steps in rehab is to apologize and tell the truth. Betty said that she had been lying to Owen and Amelia all along and that her real name is Britney. Betty said she ran away when she got pregnant with Leo because she was afraid her parents would take Leo from her. ''(\"[[Girlfriend in a Coma]]\")''\n\n\nAfter telling Amelia the truth, Betty ran away from rehab after calling her parents to tell them where she was. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\n\nBetty and her boyfriend, [[Linus]], took meth and then went to the park, where they got opioids. They both overdosed and were taken to the hospital, where they were directed to the clinic because they both seemed stable. Once she realized where she was, Betty asked Linus to get their clothes so they could leave, but then she suddenly started having chest pains. She was moved to the hospital, where they found an aortic dissection. She was rushed into surgery. After a difficult operation, Betty's parents were told she'd be okay. She was stable and awake afterward, but unaware that Linus had died while she was in surgery. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\n\nTwo weeks after her heart surgery, Betty prepared to leave town to go home with her parents and Leo. She refused to say goodbye to Amelia before they left. Later, they returned to give Leo back to Owen, saying Betty wanted to be a kid and be able to make mistakes and live her life, which she couldn't do if she had to be Leo's mom. ''(\"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe became romantically involved with [[Linus]] while they were in rehab together. She confided in him that she worried that when people learned her drug dealer had gotten her pregnant at fifteen that no one would love her and he promised to love her forever.

Instead of that surgery, he went to the ER and helped work on [[Reid Kim]] while they were attempting to resuscitate him. He left that case when Tom came in and told him to go to another room where they weren't wasting time trying to save a patient who was already dead. ''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\n\nWhen an article came out that condemned the healthcare industry, stemming from a list of possible article topics Meredith floated to a publisher, the residents discussed it in the locker room while getting ready for their days. Taryn liked the article and said Meredith was a badass for writing it, but Blake warned them that while he had Hopkins and Koracick on his resum\ue, they might have difficulty finding other jobs. ''(\"[[It's Raining Men]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing, Blake and the other residents were told they'd have to up their game to make up for the missing attendings. At the end of the day, the residents were all exhausted from the extra work they'd done. Blake then announced that Levi had been the one to turn Meredith's fraud in, turning the other residents against him. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n\nOn Meredith's first day back at work, Blake and the other residents greeted her with a cake. Afterward, they went on rounds, where they worked on the case of [[Jamie Caldwell]], which Blake followed to its end.

''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nBlake was seriously injured in the crash, with multiple facial fractures and bleeding that was obstructing his airway. They moved him to his side and packed his nose, but he later started choking on the blood, forcing them to do a cricothyrotomy to give him an airway. They ventilated him and when the firefighters finally got a doorway unblocked, he was the first patient put on a gurney and pulled out to get to the hospital. ''(\"[[I Know This Bar]]\")''\n\nBlake was taken to the ER, where they did a head CT, which showed no traumatic brain injuries. They rushed him into surgery to repair his facial fractures. After they were finished, they went to stitch him back up, but Owen noticed clear fluid around a blood stain, indicating a leak of cerebrospinal fluid. Tom found the source of the leak and repaired it. His grandmother was then told that he'd be okay.

While some firefighters worked to free Will, others worked on Brad, using a t-shirt to stem the bleeding from his face while they waited for an aid car to arrive.

Maggie assured him he was safe and they'd get him whatever he needed to feel safe.\n\nOsler's nodes indicated endocarditis, so while he had a cardiac CT, they theorized possible causes. Winston remembered him saying he hadn't left his house since lockdown started and asked Byron about his teeth. Byron said he'd used a paper clip to get a popcorn kernel out of his teeth. He had sore gums, but he refused to go to the dentist because of the pandemic. He had a dental infection which had caused the endocarditis. The CT showed an aortic valve abscess which was almost completely blocking the valves.\n\nAs they prepared Byron for his surgery, he started to freak out and left the OR.

That night, Jo tried to sneak out of the facility, but was stopped by Carly, who was waiting for her. She said the therapists rotate every night waiting for runners. Later, when Jo admitted in therapy that she was angry, she was also upset because she felt that it made her like Paul. Carly said she wasn't like Paul because she was able to feel the anger, but control her behavior. They then threw toys at the wall to release the anger.\n\n\nCarly came into the Grey Sloan ER with carbon monoxide in what they believed to be an attempted suicide. She was taken to the hyperbaric chamber to treat her. The chamber worked and her CO level came down, but she was still unconscious. When she had a seizure, they thought she must be diabetic and her sugar had crashed. They gave her D and she regained consciousness. After her therapy was complete, she was moved to a room. Jo told her that she would have to call psych to report the suicide attempt. Carly corrected that it wasn't a suicide attempt. Her carbon monoxide detector had a dead battery she'd ignored and she was just curled up with a book and her heater and the next thing she knew, she was in the chamber.

They were confused as to how Britney had met her in the first place and she explained that it was through Leo. They hadn't known she had given birth to a baby and asked to see him immediately. After meeting Leo, they decided they wanted to take him back to the hotel with them, but Owen said he was Leo's legal guardian and wouldn't allow it. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\nWhen they came back to the house to pick up Leo to take him home with them, Owen was paged to the hospital to deal with a mass overdose. Amelia stayed behind, but was later called in because Betty was among those brought in and had collapsed with chest pain. John and Carol waited in the waiting room with Owen and Amelia for news on Betty while she had heart surgery. When they were told Betty would be okay, they were excited. However, Carol wasn't sure how they'd tell Betty that Linus, her boyfriend, had died while she was in surgery. John didn't want to, but Amelia said she needed to know and hoped it would be Betty's bottom as Ryan had been for her. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\nTwo weeks later, when Betty had mostly healed from her surgery, they packed up Leo's things and left to take both of them home. However, later that night, they brought Leo back, as Betty had decided she wanted to get to be a kid and she couldn't do that if she had to be Leo's mom. She decided to give Leo to Owen and Amelia.

He explained that he'd served two tours of duty in cybersecurity for the Air Force and after seeing the surgeons work while he was injured, he decided to quit the military to go into medicine. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nCasey attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\n\nWhile the hospital was dealing with the injuries caused by a roller coaster derailing at a fair, Casey tended to patients in the clinic. He came to get Amelia for a consult on a patient with a head injury. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the hospital was hacked, Casey had the idea to use a defibrillator to override the circuit in the blood bank keypad, restoring access to blood. When Bailey learned about this, she asked what else Casey could do to help, remembering his background in cybersecurity. Casey then revealed that he had a criminal history of hacking and as a condition of that, he wasn't allowed to manipulate computer systems anymore, or allow or enable anyone else to. She pushed him and he gave her written directions to tell the FBI to gain access. When she learned that the FBI was more interested in finding the hacker than saving the hospital, she called Casey to her office, giving him access to her laptop and login and promising no one would ever know. He was able to gain access to the hospital's systems and restore normal function. He then confessed to Bailey that he had been arrested for hacking the DMV to change his sex on his license from female to male because the place where he lived wouldn't allow him to do that otherwise. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nCasey worked with Owen developing his proposal for his entry into the surgical contest. When Casey learned that acquiring the patent for a needed polymer was prohibitively expensive, Owen decided he didn't need the contest and didn't enter. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Kimmie Park]] struggled to eat and keep food down during chemotherapy, Casey supported the idea of her using medical marijuana to help her nausea, which worked. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\n\nAfter several of the doctors ingested weed cookies, Meredith told the interns they'd have to step up more and told them to keep track of what they did and whoever did the most would win a contest and get to scrub in with her on a Whipple. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\n\nAfter April was in a car accident and came to the hospital hypothermic, Casey and the other interns took shifts with the attendings doing CPR. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Casey was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. Despite a series of delays, Jo and Alex eventually got married on the ferry, witnessed by their friends. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Teddy had a sudden pain in her leg, she found Casey at the desk and asked him the name of the head of cardio. He told her and got her into a room before getting Maggie to come see her. He also checked on [[Cece Colvin]] for her so she could treat Teddy. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\n\nHe worked on the case of [[Cece Colvin]], a matchmaker awaiting a heart and kidney transplant. He had to show her pictures of his girlfriend to get her to stop trying to match him up. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\n\nCasey worked on Ned Billings with Webber. He was also there when Ned coded and Richard was unable to resuscitate. When Bailey stepped in to try to reperfuse Ned's liver to preserve it for [[Roberta Gibbs]], he initially asked if he should go get someone. Jo said to get Alex, but Bailey said to get a reperfusion machine instead so they could save the liver. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n\nCasey worked on [[Natasha Deon]], who had fallen from a hotel balcony and broken her pelvis. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Catherine had surgery to remove her tumor, Casey was in the crowd watching from the gallery until Richard closed the gallery. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n\nCasey worked on the case of [[Colin Anderson]], who was shot during a parade. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\n\nCasey treated patients in the ER during the mass opioid overdose. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\n\nJackson was treating Rick, who had been burned over a large portion of his body. He decided to use fish skin to graft the burns and had the interns skin the fish. When Richard learned the rest of the fish was being put in medical waste, he decided to host a fish fry and invited the interns. ''(\"[[And Dream of Sheep]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Jo received her DNA results, which included the name of a possible first cousin, she asked Casey about finding other relatives, including her birth mother. She said she didn't want to, but later came and asked if he could do it. He revealed that he already had and showed her the name of her birth mother. ''(\"[[And Dream of Sheep]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding Teddy in the blue light room having pain, Casey was sent to page OB and Owen. After that was squared away, he was asked to read math problems out so Dahlia could try to do them faster than [[Nora Hillridge]]. ''(\"[[Add It Up]]\")''\n\n\nCasey assisted on the case of [[Bertram Hollister]], who was having a heart procedure. ''(\"[[Reunited]]\")''\n\n\nWhen an article came out that condemned the healthcare industry, stemming from a list of possible article topics Meredith floated to a publisher, the residents discussed it in the locker room while getting ready for their days. Taryn liked the article and said Meredith was a badass for writing it, but Blake warned them that while he had Hopkins and Koracick on his resum\ue, they might have difficulty finding other jobs. ''(\"[[It's Raining Men]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing, Casey and the other residents were told they'd have to up their game to make up for the missing attendings. At the end of the day, the residents were all exhausted from the extra work they'd done. Blake then announced that Levi had been the one to turn Meredith's fraud in, turning the other residents against him. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n\nOn Meredith's first day back at work, Casey and the other residents greeted her with a cake. Afterward, they went on rounds, where they worked on the case of [[Jamie Caldwell]], which Casey followed to its end. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Casey was at the bar with some other residents, a car crashed through a window and into the bar. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nImmediately after the crash, Casey was confused, thinking there'd been a bombing, and asked if they were in the Green Zone. When his confusion persisted, Jackson examined him, but said his pupils were equal and reactive, though he had a small hematoma on his head. He told Casey to lie down until help got there. A while afterward, the firefighters finally got a door unblocked and since Casey was able to walk, Nico helped lead him out so they could get to the hospital. ''(\"[[I Know This Bar]]\")''\n\nCasey was taken from the bar to the hospital, where he was still very confused and continued to ask if there'd been a bombing. He got a CT, which showed a temporal lobe contusion, which was exacerbating his PTSD. However, before they could move him to the NeuroICU, he left the room and hid in the hospital. Amelia and Teddy searched the hospital for him and found him in the hyperbaric chamber. Later, he was stable enough to visit Taryn in her room. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe has a girlfriend, but nothing is known about her. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\n\nHe was a member of the Air Force, but quit to go into medicine.

''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\nThat night, Cece crashed, but was able to be resuscitated. They put her on amiodarone to improve her heart function and ran more tests. Her heart was barely pumping blood, so she had a heart biopsy, which showed congestive heart failure. They placed an internal defibrillator and she was put on the transplant list for a third time. When she learned that Nisha had died, she felt guilty and said she didn't want a new heart because she didn't want to live. Meredith talked to her and said she deserved to live and Nisha would want her to get a new heart. Also, Meredith wanted Cece to find her new love. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\nOn her eighth day of dialysis, Cece developed an infection in her peritoneum, meaning they couldn't use that for dialysis anymore. Since her other access sites were closed from prior surgeries, they searched for another way to get access. Meredith finally figured out they could due a translunar catheter and do dialysis through her back. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\nWhile she continued to wait, she furthered her matchmaking tendencies by trying to get up [[Casey Parker]] until he told her he already had a girlfriend, and talking to Maggie about her relationship with Jackson and her feelings about him suddenly leaving town. At the end of the day, she got Maggie to admit that she was upset about what Jackson had done and was too focused on other people to answer her own questions. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\nCece's condition continued to decline and she developed pleural effusions. She was taken for pleurocentesis, which relieved some of the pressure. During the wind storm, organs became available for Cece when [[Phoebe Moss]] was declared brain dead. She decided to go forward with the transplant despite the significant risks. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nCece was taken to the OR for surgery, but the power was knocked out by the wind storm, trapping Phoebe in the elevator. Cece realized something had gone wrong and her surgery was delayed because of it. When they finally got Phoebe out of the elevator, the transplant went forward as planned. Her heart was transplanted easily, but during her kidney transplant, she coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Andrew confessed his love to Meredith, she had a dream, which included Cece not feeling that Meredith kept her promise to find and accept love. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe said that she spent  years falling in love with straight women. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\n\nAfter hitting [[Nisha]] with her car, Cece refused to leave her side, wanting her to have someone to be with while she waited for her parents. She also promised to find Nisha love after she was recovered. When Nisha died, she was distraught and blamed herself.\n\n\nAfter Meredith hired Cece to find her love, Cece started asking Meredith questions about her life, which Meredith found frustrating and time-consuming. When Cece realized it wasn't working, she went another route and told Meredith to go buy herself five new outfits.

Sally often lied to Cora, telling her her mother had just called and said that she loved her.\n\nAs an adult, Cora became Sally's caregiver when she developed dementia. When it had progressed to the point where Sally no longer recognized her, Cora ended up in the hospital with a -centimeter pancreatic head tumor. Nick consulted with Meredith about the tumor and she said a traditional Whipple was unlikely to work. Instead, they developed a plan that involved removing all the involved organs, dissecting out the tumor, and then replacing the organs. They talked to Cora about it and she decided to have the surgery despite the risks as she feared leaving her aunt without a caregiver.\n\nThey took her into surgery, where the surgery went well until they went to re-attach her organs. There was unexpected bleeding and as they had no blood available to transfuse given the nationwide blood shortage, they decided to stop the surgery until more blood arrived to avoid additional blood loss. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]])''\n\nWhen Meredith learned that the incoming blood had been destroyed in an accident, she suggested moving Cora to the ICU to keep her alive until they had more blood and could finish her surgery.

She believes patient connection is as important as surgical dexterity. She likes to bond with patients over an anecdote. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nDahlia attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the hospital was hacked, the doctors had to resort to using old school methods to diagnose and treat patients. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\n\nDahlia worked with Jackson developing his proposal for the surgical contest. When Catherine approached her about another project she wanted Jackson to work on, Dahlia wrote both proposals and told Jackson she liked the other one. She wrote both proposals in under  days total, which meant that in order to accomplish this, she didn't sleep at all during that time. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Tyler Richardson]] was brought in with a chunk of metal in his leg, Dahlia was charged with escorting him to the CT. On the way, he woke up and pulled the metal of his leg, causing profuse bleeding. Thinking quickly, Dahlia pulled off her hijab and used it to slow the bleeding, saving Tyler's life. Later, while scrubbing in for the OR, Owen was suprised that she had removed her hijab and she replied that her hijab is \"a symbol of [her] faith, but [her] faith is about service and compassion.\" She scrubbed in on the surgery, which Tyler survived. Later, Owen returned her hijab to her, after having it washed. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\n\nAfter several of the doctors ingested weed cookies, Meredith told the interns they'd have to step up more and told them to keep track of what they did and whoever did the most would win a contest and get to scrub in with her on a Whipple. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\n\nAfter April was in a car accident and came to the hospital hypothermic, Dahlia and the other interns took shifts with the attendings doing CPR. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Dahlia was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. Despite a series of delays, Jo and Alex eventually got married on the ferry, witnessed by their friends. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nDahlia helped treat [[Cheryl Giles]] after she and her husband crashed a motorcycle. After the dog they served to avoid hitting got loose in the ER, Dahlia was sent to chase it down. She caught it, but when Cheryl said they couldn't keep the dog, her son let it loose again. Dahlia chased the dog down again, but couldn't catch it. However, when she gave up and sat down, the dog jumped up next to her. She ended up taking the dog home. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\n\nJulius came into the hospital with trouble breathing after an apartment fire. They did an x-ray, which showed a pulmonary bleb. He'd had it since he was a child and didn't want it removed because he couldn't afford the surgery. Because he had so much difficulty breathing, Alex didn't want to let him leave without having the bleb removed and nicked Julius with a scalpel to make an excuse to take him into surgery. Dahlia saw what he did and said she'd have to report him. She did, but when Julius woke up, he was relieved that it was gone and knew his mother would be happy as well. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the wind storm, Dahlia helped treat [[Georgia]], who was impaled with shards of glass. She also scrubbed in on her surgery. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nAfter the power came back, Cece was waiting in the OR for her transplant. Dahlia monitored her and was sent to find out how much time it would be before the organs were ready and found that the procurement hadn't started yet. After the transplant started, Dahlia assisted. Cece ultimately died during the surgery. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n\nDahlia was on Meredith's service and helped develop a treatment plan for her patients. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a flood of patients came into the ER with opioid overdoses, Dahlia treated a patient with a shooter's abscess and got a lesson in schooling her facial features. Later, when [[Ralph Tennyson]] came into the ER with lesions all over his feet, Dahlia debrided them and bandaged them. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\n\nJackson was treating Rick, who had been burned over a large portion of his body. He decided to use fish skin to graft the burns and had the interns skin the fish. When Richard learned the rest of the fish was being put in medical waste, he decided to host a fish fry and invited the interns. ''(\"[[And Dream of Sheep]]\")''\n\n\nAfter being beat to the answer of a math problem with an  year old, Dahlia had Casey and then the other interns, plus Maggie and Bailey, come in and have a contest to see who could do the math the fastest on a series of problems. ''(\"[[Add It Up]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Abby Redding]] came into the ER after being attacked and assaulted, Dahlia was on the case. She helped examine Abby and collect evidence after she agreed. When Abby needed surgery, Dahlia helped coordinate all the women of the hospital coming together to line the halls so she wouldn't have to see the faces of any men. ''(\"[[Silent All These Years]]\")''\n\n\nDahlia was working in the ER on [[Avi Styron]], who was in abdominal pain and waiting for a CT when [[Gemma Larson]] came in when a shoe impaled in her chest. Avi agreed that Dahlia should tend to her first. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\n\nThirteen days after Kari's stem cell transfusion, Dahlia was charged with monitoring her and tracking her progress. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nWhen Kari's finger twitched, Dahlia helped monitor her to see if it would happen again. When she squeezed Toby's hand unconsciously, Dahlia said she'd seen it. She was also there to celebrate when Kari moved her hand again, more purposefully. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nDahlia worked on the case of [[Jai Prishna]], who had fallen off a cliff and hung there for hours. She was present when he finally woke up after falling into a coma following a stroke. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to find her joy again, Bailey set up a skills lab based around the case of [[Wade Foltz]]. She challenged the residents to determine his diagnosis and then practice their surgical skills for the chance to do a portion of the surgery. Dahlia incorrectly answered Bailey's question about the hardest part of the axillary-bifemoral bypass procedure, earning her a week of rectal exam assignments. Dahlia participated in the lab, but lost the skills challenge to Taryn. ''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\n\nDahlia worked with Jo on the case of [[Shirley Gregory]], who had been a patient of Meredith's. When Shirley refused to let anyone other than Meredith work on her, Jo had the idea to have Meredith video conference in to assist. After the surgery, Dahlia cried in the hallway. When Bailey found her, Dahlia explained that she had come to Grey Sloan to learn from Meredith and knew many other residents had as well. She was upset that Bailey had just fired her. Bailey then said she could have something in common with Meredith and said Dahlia was fired as well. ''(\"[[Reunited]]\")''\n\nShe found a job in Michigan. ''(\"[[It's Raining Men]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe has a crush on [[Jackson Avery]]. She thinks he is talented and attractive. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\n\nShe was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] until she was fired after telling Bailey that she came to the hospital, as did many other residents, to learn from Meredith Grey.

He noticed the signs, but didn't know what they meant. When he asked her about them, she bit his head off. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n\nDavid invited Meredith to come to Minnesota as they were dedicating a research library to her mother. When she arrived, he gave her a tour of the facility and told her he was doing additional research into mRNA technology as part of vaccine development and cancer treatment. He then showed her a research lab that he'd had set up and asked her to work there, developing a cure for Parkinson's, a condition which he had.\n\nHe then took her out to dinner, where he elaborated on the proposed treatment and talked to Meredith about his own treatment, which he said usually worked well enough to get him through consults with patients before wearing off. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith considered his offer, she brought Amelia to Minnesota to tour the facility and examine David. She asked if he'd considered options like deep-brain stimulation, but he said he wanted a cure, which is why she was there. They just needed Meredith to say yes. At the end of the day, Meredith said she needed full autonomy to pick the team, wanted everything they learned to be accessible to anyone with Parkinson's, and asked to have the project moved to Grey Sloan. David said he couldn't do that, but did agree to let Meredith set up a satellite lab there so she could do most of her work there and travel to Minnesota once a week. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nDavid observed as research began. The first step was proving that the cells could stay alive after being injected. David became irritated when he learned that Meredith had brought Tom Koracick onto the project as Koracick had slept with his daughter, which David didn't like. Meredith reminded him that he had given her full autonomy over the staff for the project and Amelia needed a second neurosurgeon. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n\nOne morning, shortly after Thanksgiving, David called an emergency team meeting. When he arrived, he told them that he had sprained his wrist falling in his bedroom becuase his foot froze up. He was angry because his disease was progressing faster than the research. He demanded they work quicker to meet the FDA's criteria for a one-time compassionate use for him. After a long day of trials, David visited the lab and drew their attention to a sample which had % viability, enough to satisfy the FDA's requirement. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\n\nKnowing doing the surgery in Minnesota would draw too much unwanted attention, David and Kai traveled to Seattle so he could have his surgery there instead once hte FDA approved them to do the surgery within in a limited window. Because of this time limit, David lied and told Meredith he was fine even when he started feeling pain in his abdomen. He then developed a low-grade fever, which he also tried to brush off. Meredith examined him and then ordered a CT, which showed a perforated bowel. Meredith took him into surgery, but he became hypotensive while she scrubbed in, forcing her to rush in soon after and start his surgery. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, Meredith and Kai both chastised him for not telling them about his pain. Meredith said if he did it again, she would leave the program, which would cause the FDA to pull their approval. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\n\nOnce he'd sufficiently healed from that surgery, they prepared for his experimental treatment. On the day of surgery, as he got last-minute tests and they prepared the cells, Hamilton documented the process, saying it was for the book he was planing to write. Hamilton wanted the surgery to be private, but Meredith told him it was teaching hospital and she wanted to open the surgery up for all hospital staff to observe. Hamilton reluctantly agreed. Once everything was ready, Hamilton was taken to the OR, where he was secured into a halo and the cells were injected. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nBack in Minnesota, Meredith presented Hamilton's case to the staff of the Mayo Clinic. While she reported more scientifically on his progress, he was more grandiose, stating that he and his wife had played chess and his hand hadn't shaken at all. Then he surprised Meredith by offering her a permanent position in front of everyone as director of The Grey Center and Head of General Surgery. Later, away from the crowd, he showed her the new budget that had been approved for the Grey Center, which included her salary. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nDavid and Kai came to Seattle on Richard's request to test his skills to see if he needed to retire. The testing was interrupted when Richard got a call from Levi Schmitt and left to help him treat his mother, causing Kai to question his judgment, as he hadn't said a word to them before leaving. While Richard spoke to [[Jamarah Blake]] and [[MaryAnn Suchan]] about the residency program, they taped Levi Schmitt speaking about his own experience with the team. Richard then returned to the testing room and completed his tests. Kai told him he'd passed. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe is married. Prior to his sugery, he left a note for his wife on his computer in case he didn't make it. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nHe has a daughter and a granddaughter, who is twelve. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")'' Before his surgery, he wrote notes to his children and grandchildren for Meredith to send to them if he didn't make it. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nHe knew [[Ellis Grey]] when she was alive. He also did the conference circuit with Richard, who said David would make a terrible boss.\n\n\nHe is an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] at [[Mayo Clinic|The Mayo Clinic]] in Rochester, MN.

She ultimately died of inflammatory breast cancer.\n\n\n\nShe was born in a two-room shack with an outhouse. ''(\"[[Be Still, My Soul]]\")''\n\nShe and her husband adopted Maggie and raised her. The marriage fell apart while they pretended everything was fine to protect Maggie. Diane started an affair of  years with the man who serviced their car.\n\nDiane was very pleased with how easy Maggie was. She never talked back, she had good grades, and her room was always clean. She was concerned when Maggie left Boston for Seattle and called her a lot, but she was happy Maggie did so after learning about the people she met. About a year after Maggie had left the city, Diane and Bill got a divorce, after which Diane moved to Hawaii to make soaps.\n\n\nWhen Diane noticed a rash, she went to a local doctor and started treatment, but it didn't look good. As she had always taught her daughter to find the smartest person in the room or otherwise another room, she found [[Jackson Avery]] was the best and also a friend of Maggie's. She scheduled an appointment with him. However, realizing that there was a real chance of her dying soon, she started skydiving and traveling the world. ''(\"[[What's Inside]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the time for the appointment came, Diane went to Seattle, a surprise to her daughter. She quickly bonded with all Maggie's colleagues, who all liked her. Jackson examined her rash and took a biopsy, which showed inflammatory breast cancer. She asked him to help her tell Maggie and he said he would and also offered to refer her to local specialists and fly to Hawaii to operate on her.\n\nDiane then went to Meredith's house where she folded laundry, made lasagna, and put the kids to bed. When Maggie came home and confronted her mom about her behavior, Diane decided not to tell her and instead just said she'd leave and when Maggie was ready to have her in her life, she could let Diane know. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\n\nDiane came back to Seattle to have her mastectomy. She'd been going to chemotherapy and was getting a good response, but shocked Jackson by telling him she still hadn't told Maggie about the cancer. She wanted to have the surgery and then tell Maggie, but Jackson said he wouldn't go forward with the surgery until she'd told Maggie. After Maggie came in and tried to be supportive, Diane told Maggie about the breast cancer. The next day, she went in for her surgery, but during surgery, the doctors found something unexpected. ''(\"[[Till I Hear It From You]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her mastectomy, Diane got the news that her cancer had spread. She had surgery to remove more cancer from her body and continued to have radiation and chemotherapy. When she complained of stomach pain, Meredith ordered a new CT, which showed a met near her liver, which was causing the pain. When Meredith advised against removing it, Maggie pressured Diane to fire her. Maggie then found a clinical trial with promising early results that she could get into if they could lower her LFTs. Bailey figured out a way to place a stent to lower Diane's LFTs and get her into the trial. The procedure worked, but Bailey, Richard, and Jackson didn't think the trial was a good idea. Despite this and Richard advising Diane that it wasn't a good idea, Maggie pushed forward and Diane supported her, believing Maggie wouldn't do anything to hurt her.\n\nOnce on the treatment, Diane had multiple side effects. She got an infection in her arm and blood built up. She had to have fluid aspirated from her back, but she eventually started to feel a little better. She taught Maggie to make her lasagna and told Maggie to invite all her friends over to have dinner together. At the dinner, Diane started coughing heavily. She soon coughed up some blood and they rushed her to the hospital. She had a tear in her esophagus, which Richard repaired with difficulty. Maggie wanted to get her up and moving again after the surgery as soon as possible, because she'd lose her spot in the trial if she missed a treatment. Richard went and talked to Diane privately, to tell her she didn't have to keep going with the treatment if she didn't want to. She told him Maggie was a gift to her and if she died, it would give Maggie darkness not to know she did everything she could and she didn't want to do that. Richard told her Maggie was strong and she could handle it. Maggie tried to call around to find newer treatment possibilities for her mother, but Diane told her it was time to stop fighting.\n\nLater, while Diane tried to give Maggie life advice, Maggie painted her nails. When the smell overwhelmed her, Maggie went to open a window and saw that it had stopped raining. When she went back to the bed, her mother was dead. She continued to paint her mom's nails as she cried. ''(\"[[Be Still, My Soul]]\")''\n\nAfter her death, Jackson saw her loaded file that showed her medical history before she came to see him. He discovered she had already found out she was sick before she came to see him, and he guessed that she came to Seattle because he would do everything possible to cure her because of how close he was to Maggie, as well as take care of Maggie if she really were to die. ''(\"[[What's Inside]]\")''\n\n\nDiane appeared in Maggie's fever dream as a beacon of warmth and comfort after Maggie had read Ellis's letter. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to Maggie's father. However, she had a long-term affair with the man who fixed their car. They ultimately split up over it. She said leaving Maggie's father was the moment she finally felt like she could breathe again. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she surprised Maggie with a visit, Maggie was upset that she didn't give her advance warning that she was coming. Maggie also disliked how she quickly bonded with the other doctors at the hospital. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")'' She told Meredith she always wanted to have more kids, so Maggie could have a brother or sister. She was glad when Maggie found Meredith. ''(\"[[Be Still, My Soul]]\")''\n\n\nDiane quickly bonded with all Maggie's colleagues. She made plans to have dinner with Richard, but cancelled those plans when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\nWhile she was in chemo, she also formed a relationship with her nurse, Aurora, to the point where she knew Aurora's son, Lee, was re-taking his driver's test, which he'd failed twice before.

Due to his autism, he wouldn't let the doctors examine him, so Alex used his love of buildings and LEGO to talk to him. Gus was able to use LEGO to show Alex that he had significant pain in his chest. They ran a chest CT, which showed a thymoma, which Maggie noted is always malignant in children, but curable with surgery. However, before they could operate, he needed a blood transfusion as he was anemic. They got him blood, but he rejected it because it wasn't the right type. They re-typed his blood and showed AB, but with no Rh antigen, an extremely rare occurrence. Before he could have surgery, they needed to find blood donors who were an exact match to his blood so he wouldn't reject it. They identified only four potential donors in the world, but Alex promised his parents they'd keep looking until they found the blood he needed. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\nDuring his stay at the hospital, Gus continued to build with LEGO kits, including one of the Arc de Triomphe. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nThe wait was thought to be over when a call came in from Canada from a doctor treating a patient who was also Rh<sub>null</sub>. However, this was a misunderstanding and the doctor was hoping to find a donor for her patient, not offering her patient as a donor. When Gus's mother found out about the error, she was upset. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nOver time, Gus got so weak, he couldn't build his LEGO kits anymore. A blood donor was found in London, but she had severe agoraphobia, making the trip to the United States extremely difficult for her, even with her therapist. When her therapist was detained at the airport, she struggled even more and refused to leave the plane. However, after a call with Lori and meeting Gus, who was unconscious after having a heart attack, she agreed to be carried off the plane. She got into the car, but then a fog settled in, so they were stuck in traffic. Gus's organs continued to fail because of oxygen debt, so Alex took him to the hyperbaric chamber, in the hopes it would give him enough time to wait for the blood transfusion. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nIn the hyperbaric chamber, Gus was able to get more oxygen to his organs. However, he still coded, so they started decompressing the chamber as Frances was still on her way to the hospital with Owen. Alex did chest compressions and refused to stop until the blood had been transfused, at which point, he went back into sinus rhythm and regained consciousness. He immediately started to get stronger and his mother and Frances both watched as he was able to play a video game in his bed.

They wanted to interview residents, but they were all on grand rounds with [[Nick Marsh]], except [[Levi Schmitt]], who had left the program. They noted that the program had lost seven surgeons in the last year as Bailey showed them around the hospital.\n\nOnce the tour was over, they began interviewing attendings, all of whom defended the program and its efficacy. They also interviewed [[Jo Wilson]], who spoke about her decision to change from surgery to obstetrics, but still defended the surgical residency program. After speaking to her, they asked to speak to Richard next. Bailey suggested they go take a break and she'd bring him to them. At the end of the day, they said that they had a top-quality program, but they simply didn't have enough surgeons to keep the program running. They put the program on probation and left Bailey a list of concrete steps she needed to take before their return in a few weeks, telling her if she didn't make the changes, the program would be shut down. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\nJamarah returned at a later date and was pleased that they'd corrected the issues she flagged.

They arrived on the first day and were welcomed reluctantly by [[Tom Koracick]]. James was assigned to do progress notes on the patients. He then left them tape and a marker to make name tags for themselves before leaving them.\n\nAfter two hours of working on progress notes for patients, James hadn't even finished one, angering [[Karen (Season )|Karen]], who was waiting for them. Tom stepped in and noted that his problem was that he kept putting, \"Home and awaiting follow-up\" for patients who had died. All the patients had died, which created an error. Tom fixed the problem and told James to carry on. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nOne day, James brought a patient into the hyperbaric chamber for wound therapy. Due to a busy schedule, his patient was scheduled for the same slot as Meredith. While they waited in the chamber, James asked Levi if Meredith was mean, as that's what he'd heard, but she got sick before he could work with her. Levi emphatically stated that she could be tough, but she was not mean. When James' patient started to wake up and eviscerated himself, Levi helped keep James calm and then pack his intestines back in. Then he had James call for the chamber to be depressurized so the patient could be moved back to the OR. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\nJames observed a laminectomy for a meningioma that Amelia was performing. Link was also in the gallery. When Amelia did her superhero pose before starting the surgery, James asked what she was doing and Link said she was preparing to crush it. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nDuring his days off, James volunteered at the urban Indian Health Clinic. Through his work there, he met [[William Lawrence]]. He treated William for COVID, but William later returned to the clinic having what appeared to be a stroke. James accompanied him to the hospital where the stroke was confirmed and he had a thrombectomy. After his thrombectomy, James went to his room and used some traditional medicine for William. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, she cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, James was able to get his first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them  seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully.

In surgery, Meredith was impressed by his skill and technique. He told her that he knew she'd studied under Bailey. It was his dream to learn from her, but he hadn't matched to Grey Sloan when he applied. After their surgery was completed, Meredith brought Jordan to Seattle with her and introduced him to Bailey, saying he wanted to transfer to Grey Sloan to work under her. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\n\nOn Jordan's first day, he got both regular and decaf coffee and offered them to Bailey, as he didn't know her preference. She declined as she'd already had her morning smoothie, but her husband, Ben, took the caffeinated one. Later, Richard introduced him to the other residents. Jordan asked for a moment to speak and talked about how excited he was to be working under Miranda Bailey. Later, when Richard tried to assign him to a surgey under The Webber Method, he said he really wanted the chance to work with Bailey and so asked to take a rain check on The Webber Method in favor of that. Instead, he operated on the patient with Bailey's assistance. While they were operating, Jordan talked about how he approached surgery and how he wanted to learn from Bailey. She told him her preferences regarding that specific type of surgery and the surgery went well. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Levi Schmitt]] scrubbed his hands until they bled after losing a patient in surgery, Jordan told him that after his first loss, he went running until his legs gave out under him. He then pulled Levi back away from the sink and carried him to the ER, where they bandaged his hands and coached him on how to come back from it. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nJordan then attended the M&M where the case was reviewed and the doctors tried to figure out how to prevent another such death from occurring. When Bailey called on him and forced him to ask a question, he asked if there was any sign of bleeding prior to the hemorrhage and later asked Richard who was in charge during the surgery, questioning the rotating authority that came with attendings coming in and out. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nWhen an old friend of Bailey's called her about a job with NASA, Jordan encouraged her to take it, saying it was her chance to work in space and would be a dream come true. She told him it wasn't that simple, because she wasn't in the position to do things based on dreams. She then said he was the one bright spot in her life amid many struggles. He mistook this as romantic interest and leaned into kiss her. She immediately pulled back. He told her he was mistaken and walked away.

However, they ended up working together again on [[Ivan]], who had a python wrapped around his body. At the end of the day, Jordan apologized again, but told her she had given him a signal, whether she had meant to or not.

They arrived to find Nick with the patient, Mason Taylor, who was brain dead after being struck by a drunk driver. His wife wanted to donate his organs, but UNOS rejected them, so she donated his body for research. Nick explained that they would be transplanting a genetically modified pig kidney into Mason's body in the hopes that they could perfect the technology, which would eliminate the wait for donor organs. He transplanted the kidney near the groin so they had better blood supply and could see the kidney as they waited to see if it would work. After the surgery, they celebrated that the kidney was producing urine. When the kidney later stopped working, Nick had them do a biopsy and sent the residents away to avoid screaming at them. Then he did everything he could to save the kidney, but started to lose faith. Meredith suggested using epinephrine, which worked and Jordan reported that the kidney was working again.

They wanted to remove it, but his insurance would only pay for emergency surgery, so he declined and tried to leave the hospital. He became winded putting on his pants, so Alex talked him back into the bed. He then examined him and took advantage of the exam to cut him on the side of his chest with a scalpel.

Amelia and Meredith were both familiar with their work. They met Meredith and Amelia when they came to Minnesota to hear David Hamilton's pitch for them to work together to cure Parkinson's Disease. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nKai continued to work with Amelia after Amelia returned to Seattle, using video calls to share research. Kai then asked if Amelia could return to Minnesota soon to help them work out some kinks. Amelia said she would. Kai then helped Amelia get some relief from the heat by having her imagine being somewhere very cold. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nTheir research continued when Amelia and Meredith returned to Minnesota, along with newly-recruited Tom Koracick. In order to get approval for the next step, they first had to prove to the FDA that the cells would survive, so they began running trials to figure out a way to keep the cells from dying with the help of some gel brains provided by Tom. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nOn Thanksgiving, they sent Amelia a video, taken the night before, of a mechanized injector that allowed them to inject the cells without them clumping. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nWhen David fell, he put pressure on the team to work more quickly to meet the FDA's requirements to get compassionate release so he could get treated soon. Kai, [[Gavin Hawj|Gavin]], and Amelia ran trial after trial all day, trying various things to improve cell viability. When several trials failed, Kai took a fifteen minute break and got some chips. They and Amelia talked about the project while walking around. Amelia asked if Kai had ever worked on something for years that ultimately didn't go anywhere. They said no, but they had done months. Afteward, they rented a house in Hawaii for the summer, learned to surf and grow their own pineapple, then came back and started again. Finally, Amelia had the idea to cool the needle they were using to inject the cells to keep them cool. They tried various temperatures and one gave them % cell viability, enough to satisfy the FDA and allow for compassionate use. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\nThe FDA gave them a small window to do the surgery. Knowing that doing it in Minnesota would draw too much attention, Kai and David flew to Seattle to do the surgery at Grey Sloan instead. However, Kai determined that David had a low-grade fever, forcing them to cancel his surgery. The fever turned out to be due to a perforated bowel, so he had surgery on that instead. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nDavid's surgery went well, but both Meredith and Kai admonished him for not admitting to the pain sooner, as it jeopardized all their work. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nWhen Hamilton was sufficiently healed from his abdominal surgery, they prepared to do the experimental treatment. On the day of, Kai said all the cells were within the temperature range. Once everything was ready, Hamilton was taken to the OR. Hamilton had wanted the surgery to be private, but Meredith told him it was a teaching hospital, so she wanted to open the surgery up to all hospital staff to watch, which many of them did. As they did the final preparations, Kai awkwardly explained what they'd done to the residents. Then they proceeded with the surgery. There was a brief hiccup when Amelia was paged for another surgery, but Tom went in her place, allowing her to continue. The rest of the surgery went forward without incident. After it was over, Kai wondered how Amelia could have even considered leaving the OR until they realized that Amelia loves so deeply and fiercely. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\nWith the surgery a success, Kai and Amelia worked together to complete their report. They decided they needed to make Hamilton's bowel obstruction seem less like his own fault, so they carefully worded that section of the report. Once they were finished, Kai invited Amelia to a show, where they performed with their band. At the end of the night, Amelia went home with Kai and they had sex. The next morning, Kai told Amelia she could stay, but Amelia said she had to leave because she's a mom and she missed her son whenever she was in Minnesota. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\n\nWhen David surprised Meredith with a job offer after she presented his case to the staff at the Mayo Clinic, Kai encouraged her to consider it, saying that David was really a kind, supportive guy. Kai knew him before they changed their name and pronouns and he never once mixed up and said they were brave and that he was proud of them. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nKai and David came to Seattle on Richard's request to test his skills to see if he needed to retire. Before the testing started, Kai talked to Amelia, who said that Richard needed to pass the test. The testing began and took several hours. The testing was interrupted when Richard got a call from Levi Schmitt and left to help him treat his mother, causing Kai to question his judgment, as he hadn't said a word to them before leaving. While Richard spoke to [[Jamarah Blake]] and [[MaryAnn Suchan]] about the residency program, they taped Levi Schmitt speaking about his own experience with the team. Richard then returned to the testing room and completed his tests. Kai told him he'd passed. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nKai attended the party at Meredith's house for everyone to get to know Nick. At the party, they ended up playing hide and seek with Meredith's children. Later in the party, they talked to Amelia outside and said they never want children and meeting Scout at the party made him real in a way he hadn't been before. They said they didn't want to lead Amelia on, as they'd been led on before. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nNot long after the party, the article Kai, Amelia, and Meredith wrote about David's case was published. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nKai came to Seattle to surprise Amelia. Because Amelia was working, Kai decided to get some work done in a lab. While they were there, they learned that [[Zola Grey Shepherd]] had mastered several difficult puzzles. They told Meredith Zola was extremely gifted. ''(\"[[Let's Talk About Sex]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nKai and Amelia began flirting with each other shortly after their first meeting. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nFinally, one night, they each attempted to be the last person out of the lab. Kai said they were typically the last one to leave, but agreed to leave first so Amelia could win some points with Hamilton. Before they left, Kai asked about Amelia's family, whom Tom had mentioned. Amelia told Kai about her son and his dad, but then said she was single. Kai said they were also single. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nAfter a major breakthrough in their research, they asked Amelia to go get dinner, but Amelia had to catch a flight back to Seattle. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\nWhen Kai and David came to Seattle for David's surgery, Kai and Amelia kissed outside the hospital after Amelia used guided meditation to help Kai calm down. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nAfter Owen's surgery, Kai met Amelia at Joe's, where Amelia explained that her life was messy. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nOnce Hamilton's surgery was successfully completed, Kai and Amelia worked together to finish their report. They finished and then Kai invited Amelia to their band's performance. After the performance, Amelia went home with Kai and they had sex. The next morning, Kai told Amelia she didn't have to leave, but Amelia insisted that she did because she was a mom who missed her son. ''(\"[[The Makings of You]]\")''\n\nAt Meredith's party, Kai ended things between them after meeting Scout, because they never wanted children and didn't want to lead Amelia on any longer. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\nAfter the breakup, they texted that they missed Amelia. Later, they came to the hospital and told Amelia they couldn't sleep and the two of them kissed.

They started dating and three months later, the pandemic hit. They decided to move in together to have guaranteed, COVID-free sex. Then they decided to get married, to do something happy.\n\nAfter getting married, Karissa and Shayne went over to [[SFD Station |station ]] to get tested for COVID. As they were leaving, they ended up being tailgated by a truck. The truck then passed them, but hit something and the loading ramp came out of the back of the truck. Shayne tried to stop the car, but didn't have time and they drove up the ramp into the back of the truck. Karissa had only minor lacerations, but Shayne was crushed between the steering wheel and the car. When station  arrived at the scene, Andy climbed in the back of their car to check on them and put collars on their necks. Then she started two IVs in Shayne to stabilize him as much as possible while they waited for USAR to arrive.\n\nWhile they waited, Karissa started panicking about being trapped in the car and begged them to save her first because she had people who cared about her and needed her, unlike Shayne, who only had her. Soon after, they cut through the side of the truck and pulled Shayne out that way. They got him onto a stretcher, put a temporary binding on his pelvis, and sent him to the hospital. Then they got Karissa out and put her in a separate aid car to the hospital. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, Karissa and Shayne were taken to separate rooms to be treated. Karissa had only minor injures, but complained of a headache, so they took her for a head CT. The CT showed a minor contusion and small brain bleed, so she was admitted to be observed overnight, but was told she'd be okay. Later, she spoke to Shayne on a video call and he asked for an annulment, saying the accident had helped him realize she was self-absorbed and would never change. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Shayne Riley]]. He says he knew early on that she was the love of his life. They got married during the [[COVID- Pandemic]] after isolating together to ensure regular sex. However, after they were in an accident, Karissa begged to be saved first, despite him being more seriously injured, saying that she had people who cared about her and he didn't have anyone but her. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")'' After hearing these remarks, Shayne asked her for an annulment, saying he didn't find her self-absorption charming anymore.

The CT showed that the tumor was back, meaning she needed to have awake brain surgery so they could monitor her function as they worked. While in surgery, she was able to sing, her passion, but wasn't able to speak normally when the edge of the tumor was stimulated, meaning she'd lose her ability to speak if they operated. They told [[Peg]] about this and Peg challenged them to go back to their research and find another option, because Kimmie faced everything with a smile and they should do better for her. They had an idea to use frequency waves to treat shatter her tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue, but while they developed the technology, she had to have more radiation and chemotherapy to treat the cancer.

She fired Alex and decided she wanted to move Kimmie to another hospital for treatment. However, Alex went to her personally and explained to her the benefits of using medical marijuana over conventional medicine. She agreed and Kimmie was given the oil, which greatly helped her nausea.

Jo operated with the hope of resecting the tumor and reducing his pain, which would buy him more time, as his wife was  weeks pregnant and he was desperate to live long enough to meet his son. However, when they opened, Jo found that the tumor was too invasive, so instead of removing the tumor, she performed an ileostomy to make him more comfortable and buy him a little more time. After his surgery, Jo told Kristen that he had a month at most to live. Kristen asked them to do a c-section immediately so he could meet his son, but Jo said it wasn't safe because she was too early.

They immediately rushed her upstairs into surgery so they could do a c-section. After the baby was delivered, Jo was forced to do a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding. Kristen was stable and awake after her surgery and told her newborn son how much his father had loved him. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to [[Simon Clark]] until his death. He was diagnosed with cancer shortly after they got married.\n\nThey used to live in a two-story townhouse with an upstairs office Kristen was convinced was haunted. When she would go up there, Simon would say, \"Goodbye forever.\" When he was diagnosed with cancer, she asked him to stop, so he started saying, \"Hello forever,\" a habit that continued through the rest of their marriage until Simon's death. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\n\nShe and Simon have one child, [[Jamal Clark]].

When she arrived, she first went to meet with Suzanne and explained to her how she would work methodically to figure out what was wrong with Suzanne. She oversaw as Suzanne got a pericardial window to release the fluid buildup around her heart and then asked Suzanne's permission to remove all treatments, all medications, so that she could look for things that might've been hidden by the medications. After some reluctance, Suzanne consented. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\nSuzanne's previously treated symptoms started to appear again, causing discomfort. They continued to run tests, which still didn't show anything conclusive. During this time, Meredith expressed concern that Lauren was overworking Andrew, concerns Lauren justified by saying she didn't have time to find someone else and get them up to date on Suzanne's case. Finally, after Andrew noticed that Suzanne's platelet count had dropped almost to zero, they did a bone marrow biopsy. That showed hemophagocytosis, a result of macrophage activation syndrome, a known complication of Still's disease, which she had prior to the appendectomy without knowing it. They got her on high-dose steroids, which caused her to feel better almost immediately and said she'd be referred to a rheumatologist to manage her condition. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Richard started exhibiting symptoms during his presentation at the Surgical Innovation Conference, a worried Andrew contacted Lauren to ask for her help. She was out of the country and couldn't come to Seattle to help out but she did send Andrew a list of possible diagnoses.

He is roommates with [[Taryn Helm]]. He is the ex-boyfriend of [[Nico Kim]].\n\n\n\nWhen Levi was a child, he was determined to be first in line to get a comic book, but on the way, a block from the store, he flipped over the handlebars of his bike and broke both his arms.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi was selected to be part of a group of [[Clerkship|\"sub-i's\" doing a rotation]] at Grey Sloan Memorial as a sort of extended interview to attempt to get an [[Internship|internship]] there. On his first day, he was observing a surgery when he leaned over the body cavity and his glasses fell in. Later, Levi went to apologize to Jo about what he'd done. She told him to buy contacts, which he said he'd already done, and the two ended up going back to Levi's mom's basement to have sex.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day at work, he returned her name tag, which she'd left there accidentally. He and the other sub-interns were challenged to find a suitable abdominal wall donor for Megan. He found a good donor, but didn't know how to approach the family about it. He went to Jo, who took over the case and got to scrub in on the surgery as a result.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi later returned to the hospital for an official interview for an internship with [[Richard Webber|Drs. Webber]] and [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]]. During the interview, he revealed that he tried wearing contacts to keep his glasses from falling off his face, but he didn't like touching his own eyeball, so he instead started using a band to keep his glasses on his face.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nLevi attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a roller coaster derailed at a fair, Levi tended to [[Cleo Kim]], who was trapped in the roller coaster car. He struggled with suctioning properly while April and Meredith operated.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nLevi scrubbed in on surgery on [[Judy Kemp]], who needed a splenectomy. When Meredith determined she needed blood and wasn't able to access it because of the hospital hack, she asked who in the OR had an appropriate blood type. Levi raised his hand and he was hooked up to do a direct transfusion to Judy.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref>\n\nLevi started to feel faint due to blood loss and Meredith asked someone to get him a basin to vomit in. He tried to get it himself and passed out on the floor. He was given saline to recover. After he woke up, Judy asked to see him. She thanked him for saving her life and told him to be proud of it and stand up straight. <ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was called to Bailey's house to help her with something. He became disturbed at the things she asked him to retrieve and when she told him to take off his scrubs before coming the next time, prompting him to stand up for himself and say he didn't feel safe with what was happening. She then told him she wasn't trying to seduce him. She was working on the prototype for her surgical contest entry.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nAfter overhearing Maggie, Amelia, and Meredith planning a game night, Levi showed up with Taryn. Maggie just shut the door in their faces.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Dayna Rutledge]] came into the ER after a car accident and told the doctors about her recent cancer diagnosis and promise of a good outcome, Levi was impressed with her oncologist. However, Owen told him never to promise anything like that to patients or Owen would end his career.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Arizona became worried about [[Lanie]] while she was giving birth, she asked Levi to get a cart together with everything they might need. He found an old cart and stocked it with supplies, but when Arizona looked at it, she noted that he'd put things in all the wrong places and rearranged them based on their use. Lanie's birth went smoothly, but they later used the cart when another new mom hemorrhaged.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was in the OR with Bailey when she started to feel the effects of the weed cookie she'd ingested. He stayed to assist Jo as she operated in Bailey's place and retrieved Richard's cancer pen so she could determine exactly where the cancer stopped in order to save part of his stomach.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nLevi helped Jo with [[Milo Jankovic]], who had swallowed a chew toy and was whistling when he breathed. Once they located the whistle, he did the bronchoscopy with Alex's guidance to remove it.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Vik sued the hospital for wrongful termination, Bailey and Richard went to Levi to ask him if he'd ever seen anything to indicate that Vik was incompetent. Levi said he had, but also shared an unhelpful account of Bailey when she was high.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nAfter April was in a car accident and came to the hospital hypothermic, Levi and the other interns took shifts with the attendings doing CPR.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Levi was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding due to a faulty GPS link on the invitation April had sent out. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. Despite a series of delays, Jo and Alex eventually got married on the ferry, witnessed by their friends.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi helped treat [[Nisha]] after she was hit by a car.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> The night after her surgery, he was with her when she spiked a fever post-op. When tests showed that the infection she had was necrotizing fasciitis, he went along with the team into the hyperbaric chamber to debride her wound. After Nisha died, he had to wait along with the others for the chamber to decompress before they could leave. After leaving work, he went to the bar, where [[Nico Kim|Nico]] bought him a beer.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Dave Buckley]] came into the ER after having mysteriously collapsed and nearly severing two fingers with a table saw, Levi delivered the news that his blood alcohol content was higher than he thought it could get.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia brought Betty into the hospital one day and asked Levi for a drug test for Betty. Levi misunderstood and brought Amelia a sample of his own urine. She sent him away to try again.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] took a personal day last-minute, Webber told Taryn and Schmitt that they were to report to Andrew and remember to provide patients the best level of care. They helped Andrew treat a man with lacerations and Levi had trouble with a cut on his forehead. Levi struggled, so Andrew gave him a pointer. Later, when [[Molly Graham]] stopped breathing, Andrew had to intubate and brushed off the interns' help, which Richard disapproved of.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nLevi worked on the case of [[J.J. Williams]], who broke his arm trying to climb a fence. His arm was broken, which they confirmed with an x-ray. However, the x-ray also showed a mass, which a biopsy confirmed was cancerous. They told him and his mother and J.J. was worried about going bald, prompting Link to cut his own hair and let J.J. help him.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the wind storm, Levi was sent to the clinic with Nico to clear it of patients. He and Nico argued over a patient as they worked, but Levi insisted he could handle it because he had experience. After taking a patient to peds, Nico came back to make sure Levi got back okay. After Levi said he'd wait it out in the clinic, Nico went to leave and got swept away as soon as he took one step outside. Levi crawled to him and then helped him get into a nearby ambulance. In the ambulance, Levi said he didn't know he was gay when he was young because he didn't have opportunity to explore the feelings he had. After his speech, Nico kissed him again. Then they had sex in the ambulance.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the storm had calmed somewhat, they were startled when Alex came into the ambulance to escape the wind as they were getting dressed. They worried they'd be fired. Levi helped while Link and Jackson operated on [[Jed Lundberg]], who had had his legs crushed by the elevator, and found a way to let him keep both his legs. After his surgery, Jed had nerve function in his foot, which was a sign the surgery worked. At the end of the day, Alex told them what they did was unacceptable and instructed them to use rooms with locks in the future.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Owen was accidentally injected with a sedative during [[Claire Conway|Claire Conway's]] surgery, Levi intubated him and moved him to a room, where he continued to monitor Owen and give him fluids until the sedative wore off. He then extubated Owen. This incident inspired him to start wearing contacts instead of glasses so he could look as confident as he felt, though he needed Taryn's help to put them in.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nLevi started his ICU rotation while [[Natasha Deon]] was in the ICU after her accident. Every day, he examined her and gave report on her condition. When she needed surgery, he scrubbed in to assist. After she and Garrett decided to have her ventilator turned off, Levi was present at their last-minute wedding and her death.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nLevi worked on the case of [[Kimberly Thompson]]. He was engaged in the drama between her and Maggie, whom she had bullied in medical school.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nLevi worked with Nico to prepare for an upcoming hip replacement, but when a mass overdose brought a flood of patients to the ER, the surgery was rescheduled and Levi and Nico instead operated on a patient who had had a drug overdose and fell, which broke both her arms.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was on the case of [[Hunter Martinez]], but was removed from the case when Jo asked to be put on the surgery. Levi was upset, because he knew Jo was getting preferential treatment, but then she pointed out that he was only on the case himself because of Nico.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nLevi helped treat [[Douglas Hall]], who came into the ER after a car accident with his wife. He had fractures to his clavicle and humerus, but was otherwise okay. Jackson was treating Rick, who had been burned over a large portion of his body. He decided to use fish skin to graft the burns and had the interns skin the fish. When Richard learned the rest of the fish was being put in medical waste, he decided to host a fish fry and invited the interns.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Maggie introduced the new mood rooms, Levi waited in one to take Bailey's blood pressure after she played tetris. However, they were all called away by Dahlia, who wanted help competing in math problems against [[Nora Hillridge]].<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nLevi helped with the case of [[Caleb Hicks]], who was at the hospital for an abdominal wall, penis, and scrotum transplant.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nLevi assisted on [[Josh Sterman|Josh Sterman's]] surgery. When Nico made an error, Josh collapsed after surgery and died in the OR as Maggie tried to repair the damage. Nico snapped at Levi when Levi tried to console him.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nWhile at a flower shop to buy flowers for Nico, Levi met and talked to [[Lucas Ripley]].<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], x (S)</ref> When he was leaving the flower shop, he saw that Ripley had collapsed on the sidewalk and he stepped in to help. He rode with Ripley to the hospital, where he was identified. Levi hailed himself a hero for saving the Fire Chief. He tried to share his success with Nico, but Nico responded coldly to him. Levi continued to press him, but stopped when Link said what Nico was going through is unlike anything else and he needs to be allowed to process it on his own.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref> After learning that Ripley had died, Levi purchased the same flowers he'd bought for Vic and came to the station on the day of the funeral to talk to her and explain to her what Ripley hoped to say with the flowers.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], x (S)</ref>\n\n\nAt some point, he was rounding on [[Gabriella Rivera]] in peds and read \"Ellis Grey\" on her wristband, which confused him as he had heard [[Luis Rivera|Luis]] call her Gabby. He thought the name on the wristband was a mistake and went to look for Meredith to question her about it, but she wasn't at work that day. Since he felt like he couldn't afford to make another mistake, he went to Bailey instead, which led to Meredith's insurance fraud being discovered and her subsequent firing along with Richard and Alex.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Frances Pinfield]] came to the US to donate blood to [[Gus Carter]], Levi went to meet her at the airport, but reported that Frances was struggling just to get off the plane. With Owen's help, they were able to get her to the car, but on the way to the hospital, a fog settled in and they were stuck in traffic and accidents.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAfter things settled, they left the car. Owen said he'd carry Frances to a nearby ambulance, which they'd use to get to the hospital. Owen was able to convince the paramedics to go along with this by treating the patient they were working on. At the hospital, Levi brought Frances juice and cookies while her blood was extracted.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nNico and Levi's relationship remained stable after their reconciliation. Levi worked on [[Jai Prishna]] at work. While he started out as a miracle case, he slipped into an inexplicable coma, which made Levi's body ache. Nico comforted him. After a few weeks, Levi was about to extubate Jai per his wife's request, but Amelia and Link saved the day by diagnosing fat embolism syndrome. They started an experimental protocol, which proved successful after a few more weeks.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nWhile the rest of the residents got pulled into Bailey's skills lab, Levi was contacted by Meredith to bring her supplies so she could organize a street clinic for her work crew. He arrived with the supplies and shared he felt like he was going to get arrested for stealing from the hospital. She quipped she owned the hospital and that he was therefore just bringing her her own stuff. He later joined her as she brought [[Robin (Season )|Robin]] to Grey Sloan's parking lot for an ultrasound and asked Jackson to perform a biopsy. Levi assisted Jackson during the autopsy and told him that he was a Gryffindor, so he felt brave when he complied with Meredith's request, but he was scared that Bailey would find out and fire him. Jackson, a Gryffindor too, promised he would cover for him if she were to find out because he was not afraid of getting in trouble if it meant that Meredith could help people.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nUnder Andrew's supervision, Levi let a catheter guide wire slip into the patient's body. They had to perform an emergency procedure in the cath lab to retrieve it. An angry Bailey appeared while they were doing so and demanded a full report. Levi was surprised that she seemed to aim her anger at Andrew. After the patient was saved, Andrew told him Bailey knew full well that Levi had made the mistake but it happened under his supervision and therefore, it was his responsibility. However, Andrew said it was his responsibility to talk to the patient and his daughter, which Levi did very clumsily by explaining how the procedure should have gone and where he went wrong. Additionally, Andrew ordered him to hold onto a guide wire for another week. When Nico learned of his mistake, he told Levi to demand more of himself and took him to the skills lab to practice until he got it right.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith's article was published as an attack on Grey Sloan, [[Blake Simms]] teased the other residents that they would have a hard time finding work elsewhere in the future. Levi's mother found the article and sent it to his entire family. His aunt Carol wanted to reschedule her carpal tunnel surgery to another hospital but Levi called his mother to assure her that Grey Sloan was still a good hospital. Andrew interrupted his call to tell him to get to work as he was contributing to issues touched upon in Meredith's article by making private calls instead of working. Levi assisted Jackson during the surgery on [[Clervie Martin]]. Jackson had worked hard to prevent Tom from using the surgery as a free positive press in order to protect Clervie's parents. However, after seeing the amazing results, Levi admitted he regretted Jackson's decision because the positive publicity would have helped Grey Sloan's reputation and in extension his career, which wasn't as established as Jackson's. His comment rubbed Jackson the wrong way.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was excited when [[Carly Davis]] had to be treated inside the hyperbaric chamber, finally giving him the opportunity to experience it, but Jo inserted herself into the case, meaning Levi was out.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nLevi and Nico planned a Capitol Hill trip for Halloween. His mother asked him not to share any pictures of the trip on social media as his family might see but he didn't want to hide his being gay from them. When Jackson found out there wasn't going to be a Halloween parade on the peds floor since Alex was gone, he instructed Levi to organize it, disrupting his plans to leave early. While Levi was rushing to decorate the peds floor, a kid came up and asked him to help him find a costume. Levi brought in all the costumes he could find but the boy rejected all of them and expressed his desire to be a sunflower. Levi then devoted himself to make sunflower costumes out of trauma gowns. He ditched his Dungeons & Dragons paladin costume for his own sunflower costume. Levi and Taryn attended the parade and Nico surprised Levi by showing up, too. Levi took a selfie of the two of them in their costumes and shared it on social media, saying happiness should be shared.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was called as a witness for Meredith's hearing with the medical commission. He forgot his tie so Nico gave him his lucky tie from his locker. While being questioned, he nervously expressed how good of a teacher Meredith was as she never partook in mean nicknames and made him save a patient by having him act as a human blood bank during surgery. Eventually, he had to confess to the entire room that he was the one who had brought up the fraud to Bailey. He profoundly apologized to Meredith and explained he had thought the false name on the wristband was an error and had felt like he couldn't afford to make another mistake. He broke down and ran out of the room as soon as the prosecutor was done with him. He returned to the hospital to work. [[Blake Simms]] had somehow found out and shared with the entire group of residents that Levi had been the one to rat out Meredith, making him persona non grata.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nThe other residents continued to be mean to him so he sought comfort in Nico's companionship. While they were making out one morning, Nico made him leave for rounds, promising a reward later. He joined the other residents for rounds while they were eating Meredith's welcome back cake. He didn't get a piece. Levi defended himself by saying he was just doing his job, which Blake likened to the Nazis' excuse. Levi didn't like that as his great-grandfather had been in a concentration camp. Hannah made Blake apologize but insisted Levi was still a traitor. While bringing [[Elliott Calhoun]] up to surgery, Levi told Taryn she couldn't be mad at him forever. They started arguing until Elliott broke it up and asked them to make a detour to the NICU so he could see his son before surgery. The surgery went well but Elliott's heart didn't restart, most likely due to hibernating myocardium. Levi and Nico went to the bar to de-stress after Levi's awful day. Nico wanted to get dinner first but Levi was eager for dessert. Levi went to get them some more drinks when a car suddenly crashed into the bar.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Levi has to help his injured friends.]]\nLevi was the only resident uninjured. Ben and Nico snapped him out of his daze to get him to help out. Levi was tasked with keeping Blake stabilized and prevent him from choking on the blood originating from his mid-facial fracture. Levi started to panic that Taryn and Blake would die, but Jackson reassured him that wouldn't happen. Station 's crew then managed to get into the bar and all injured people were transported to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where Levi also went to help out.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\nHe hid in a supply closet and cried. Bailey found him there and convinced him that their friends needed help, so she got him up and he sprung into action. Bailey took him to Taryn and assigned him to the case. He assisted Meredith as she put in an IVC filter. An inebriated Taryn then said she didn't want Levi working on her as he was the reason the love of her life had been fired. As Meredith asked Levi to go back to the ER with her, Levi collapsed. Meredith did a full work-up and found an elevation of cardiac enzymes, which could indicate a heart attack. She asked if there was someone she could call for him but he said his mother would only panic, Nico was working, and Taryn hated him, so there was no one. Meredith then paged Teddy, who performed an angio as Meredith sat by Levi's side. He told her was so sorry for reporting her and she told him she had forgiven him since it all worked out. Teddy then diagnosed broken-heart syndrome caused by the extreme stress of the accident. He was put in a patient's room to rest and woke up with Nico by his side. Nico informed him Taryn made it through surgery and climbed into bed with him. Later, Nico took him to visit Taryn, who stopped him as he apologized and said she needed her best friend to get through this. They then talked about her confessing her love for Meredith.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref> Levi was soon discharged and given a couple of weeks of medical leave.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi's mother interrupted Levi and Nico to inform him that his favorite uncle Saul, whom she didn't like, was dying in his retirement home. Levi rushed over to be able to say goodbye, bringing Nico with him. Levi asked about his aunt Gertie, whom Saul said would arrive when she could. He then asked about Levi still living with his mother. Levi explained his mother had learned something about him and had asked him to keep it private. He then came out by introducing Nico as his boyfriend, at which point Saul flatlined and passed away. Despite being only culturally Jewish, Levi wanted to honor the tradition of not leaving the body of the deceased unattended. When Gertie arrived, he thought she came to relieve him, but she left after briefly sobbing over Saul's body, only stating that she and Saul promised each other that the end was the end. Levi and Nico were forced to stay. As they were playing cards, an unknown man came in and broke down over Saul's body. Daniel revealed he was Saul's lover. Saul had told him all about Levi, including the fact that he thought Levi was gay, like him. Daniel explained that Myrna and Saul didn't get along because she bought into the homophobia taught to her by her parents. Daniel then offered Levi to prepare Saul's body together. As they did so, Levi inquired why Saul chose to live a fake life with Gertie. Daniel pointed out the difference between their generations, with Levi's generation taking for granted what is possible now. As Levi vowed to never do that again, Daniel said he thought it had been Saul's plan for Levi to be there at the end to make sure Levi would give himself the freedom that Saul had not allowed himself to have. They recited a psalm and covered up the body.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Levi tells his mom he is moving out.]]\nBack home, Levi and Nico started packing. Myrna barely responded to Saul's passing, angering Levi. He said he was super gay and that her response meant that she wasn't truly accepting him. Myrna lashed out at Nico, thinking he had put Levi up to this, but Nico assured her it was all him, even though he agreed with every word. Levi then thanked his mother for having taken care of him and officially announced that he was moving out. He and Nico then left.<ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Levi and Nico watch the dancing couple.]]\nLevi temporarily moved in with Nico, which he loved. On Levi's first day back at work, Levi noticed that Nico was subtly encouraging him to find his own place. Nico explained they weren't at the cohabitating step just yet. Levi and Meredith diagnosed abdominal metastases in a woman who was in Seattle for a ballroom dancing championship. They initiated palliative care. The woman's husband approached Levi, whom reminded him of his kind and gentle grandson, and asked him for a favor. Levi gathered the other residents and they improvised a ballroom setting in the cafeteria to allow the couple to have one final dance. Afterword, an emotional Levi took Irene back to her room. She told him not to cry because she had had a beautiful life and got to end it with the love of her life by her side. She asked him if he had found his, which he didn't reply to. As they were making out in an on-call room, Levi cautiously told Nico that he wanted a love like Irene and Norman's, but Nico brushed off the comment.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nAs Nico found Levi apartment hunting, he once again refused to let Levi live with him. Levi invited him to come check out an apartment with him that night, but Nico said he had to meet his parents. He didn't want Levi to come, stating that they were super critical and had impossibly high standards. After successfully convincing [[Joey Phillips]] to do his PT, Levi built up the courage to once again ask Nico to introduce him to his parents. Nico repeated his earlier statement. Levi replied he knew how to take criticism. Nico then revealed that he hadn't come out to his parents. Levi was baffled giving Nico's reaction to Levi's first experiences as a gay man. Nico was aware of that but he brushed it off and left to meet his parents.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> They stopped talking with each other afterward as Nico only appeared interested in having sex. After a stressful day, Nico found him in an on-call room and wanted to have sex, but Levi stopped him and said he wanted more. Nico got angry and said he couldn't just talk about his feelings. He said they should end things if Levi couldn't handle that. Levi then gave in, saying he accepted that, and they proceeded to make out.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOn Meredith's pro bono surgery day, Levi invited Taryn to come to a speakeasy that night with him and Nico. Taryn said she wasn't in the mood to see Levi fawning over Nico because of how good the sex was despite Nico not treating Levi as an equal in their relationship. The two of them then overheard Nico thanking Link for setting up an interview for him for Link's old job with the Mariners. Nico briefly told Levi the opportunity was too good to pass up. As he headed into his surgery, Taryn pointed out this proved her statement. In surgery, Levi asked Link about the Mariners job. Link admitted it was a crazy schedule though he added it didn't have to be a dealbreaker. He told Levi relationships are give and take and advised Levi to tell Nico how he felt about it. Later, Nico asked Levi to skip their speakeasy plans for the night and just head straight to bed, which Levi refuse because he wanted to talk about the job. Nico was annoyed and said he refused to feel bad about his dream job. Levi then pointed out he was the only one making sacrifices and compromises in their relationship. He wanted more and he was tired of telling Nico that. Nico then said he hoped Levi would find someone who could give that to him, ending things between them. Now being homeless as well, Levi went to Joe's by himself, where he met Jo. She invited him to stay with her at her loft, which she found too empty after Alex had left her. Levi gladly accepted.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Levi bonds with Jo.]]\nThey struck up a friendship and Levi opened up to her about how his mom suffocated him when he was living with her, which Jo commented didn't seem too bad. Levi initially was on the team to help figure out what was going on with Richard, but Jo made him help her out in the ER. He was disappointed but she told him a resident would not solve Richard's case. Later, he complained to her about a photo that Nico had posted on Instagram, which made it seem like Nico was totally fine without him. Jo was annoyed and pointed out that with all the other attendings working on Richard, this was Levi's moment to shine. That night, Levi said he felt like Jo had tried to make it clear to him that he had overstayed his welcome, so he was planning on sleeping at the hospital. Jo assured him he had the wrong idea but he had been messing up at work, which is why she had to yell at him as his attending. However, she said his living with her was keeping her sane, so she made him stay.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref> While working a case of a young baseball player whose lifelong dream was compromised by an injury, Levi really felt for the guy. Owen told him he needed to find a way to suck up his feelings or else find another job.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs COVID- first hit the United States, Seattle was amongst the country's cities to be hit the hardest, forcing Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to quickly adapt to the new reality. With all non-emergent surgeries cancelled, Levi often manned the tent outside the hospital where family could await updates on their loved onces since visitors were no longer allowed either. As such, he was often tasked with telling elderly people that their spouses of decades had passed away. At one point, Nico arrived and asked him to let Mrs. Bronson know that her husband's procedure had gone well. Levi blurted out he hoped Nico was doing okay despite things getting progressively worse around him because he still cared about him, even though they were no longer together. Levi himself was having a particularly bad time after telling the th person out there that their loved one had died and he was scared things would get much worse. Nico shrugged and said he was doing fine, after which he simply walked off. Soon after, a fight erupted in the tent between parents whose teenagers had gotten hurt while breaking quarantine rules. In their physical fight, they knocked Bailey to the ground.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nLevi got her to the OR and examined her ankle. He suspected a sprain but ordered an X-ray and paged Nico just to be safe. Nico asked to let him know the results. Levi bandaged up the ankle. Soon after, Nico came to confirm that there was no fracture. Levi was annoyed that he completely ignored the fact that Levi had been correct. Bailey then used Levi as her assistant to wheel her to her meeting with Catherine, where he witnessed how Maggie barged in to yell at Catherine to get back together with Richard. Afterward, Nico found Levi in a supply closet. He admitted he had been a terrible boyfriend but he came to provide Levi with some much-needed stress relief. Levi let him go down on him.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nAs the pandemic worsened, Richard announced that residents officially were only allowed to treat confirmed non-COVID patients. As a result, Levi had to fetch Jo for [[Val Ashton|Val Ashton's]] abdominal pain as her COVID test was still pending. It came back negative, but Bailey soon kicked Levi off the case to take his place when the scans showed a hepatic pregnancy.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nNico and Levi's stress relief agreement continued, though their interactions out in the public were limited to short greetings. However, Jo easily deduced what was going on by seeing Levi's face when Nico walked by. Levi admitted she was right and cited the Dutch government's advice to find a designated sex partner to satisfy his needs. However, after a terrible day, Nico came to sit down with Levi and told him that he hated everything but Levi. Levi said he wanted to invite Nico over since Jo wouldn't be home, though he recalled they hadn't been great to each other in the past and he wasn't sure that things had changed. Nico said a lot had changed in this pandemic and he accompanied Levi home.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nAs Jo grew increasingly depressed, Levi had to motivate her to get out of the bed in the morning. Together, they worked on [[Val Ashton]] with intern [[Reza Khan]], a fully-trained vascular surgeon from Pakistan who had to redo his training in order to obtain a medical license for the US. Reza was impressed with Jo's skills, which Levi had to point out meant something. He brought home pizza for dinner. Jo told him she had delivered a baby that day. The recently unparalleled joy she felt while doing so had made her consider switching to OB/GYN. Levi advised her to sleep on it before making such a major decision.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nWith a surge in cases, residents were allowed to treat COVID patients. While the rest of the staff treated two girls who were kidnapped by a suspected sex trafficker and later their kidnapper, Levi treated [[Opal]], who claimed to have been mugged in order to get inside the hospital. Ignorant of her involvement with the sex trafficking circuit, Levi examined her and didn't read into her subtle questions about the chaos surrounding kidnapper's case. After Opal disappeared to go \"to the restroom\", Levi called the cops so she could make a statement on the mugging. He later found Jo and asked if she had come to a decision. She picked up on his shaming her a little, as she suspected Meredith would, too, but Jo was more and more serious.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nNico and Levi regularly spent the night together. Levi was working the ER when Ben brought in Andrew, who had been stabbed while pursuing sex traffickers. After the initial surgery, Levi found Ben and asked him to let Carina know that Andrew was stable. Ben's phone caught his eye and Levi saw Opal, the woman he had treated the day before. Levi was shocked when Ben informed him of her identity and involvement in the ordeal and Levi began to worry that it was all his fault. Levi paged Nico for a peptalk. Nico listened to him and deemed that he wasn't in the right headspace to scrub in on Andrew's surgery, so Levi had Reza replace him. Levi then looked after Val Ashton, who crashed just as Cormac and Jo were bringing her baby over so Val could see her for the first time. Jo and Levi ran the code but they lost her. Levi then heard that Andrew was circling the drain and retreated to an on-call room, where Nico found him. Levi was worried that by spending so many years pretending to be someone he wasn't, he had wasted all the time he was supposed to be happy, since there was no sign of things going back to normal any time soon. Nico comforted him.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Andrew's memorial service, Nico and Levi sat down outside. Levi vented over all the feelings, including guilt and rage, that he felt over Andrew's death. Nico commented his go-to feeling was numb. Levi laughed and said that summed up everything that went wrong in their relationship. Levi heard that Bailey had launched an investigation into Andrew's death to see if any medical errors had been made. He found her by herself in an empty OR gallery and brought up the memorial service. He said he was a bad Jew in general but he did follow the traditions, because he found the protocols for how to grieve a loved one's death were helpful to start the healing. While he was on bad terms with his own mother, her death would still make him fall apart, so he could only imagine what Bailey was going through. He reminded her that she had people she could be with, people who needed to grieve with her. He advised her not to let the pandemic take that from her, too. Afterward, Levi attended the memorial service with Nico. They held hands in public, a possible sign of romantic reconciliation.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Levi began treating [[Marcella Diaz]] while the hospital ran low on available ventilators. As her sats dropped, Marcella was moved to the COVID ICU under Levi's care. As her condition worsened, Marcella's daughter [[Veronica Diaz]] was also admitted as her mild symptoms quickly progressed. Despite his best efforts, including a Hump Day rap, Marcella's condition worsened quickly despite BiPAP. Levi decided to intubate her to get her hooked up to a mechanical ventilator. He successfully did, but Maggie arrived moments later to inform him that Veronica had crashed and was in need of the last available ventilator. While Levi manually bagged Marcella, the doctors decided to follow protocol and give Veronica the ventilator. Fortunately, Maggie came up with a way that allowed patients to share on ventilator, so mother and daughter Diaz were hooked up to the same one. Levi was relieved to get a break and asked interns Alma and Sara Ortiz to keep him in the loop of all changes in their condition.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was one of the doctors who assisted in the free COVID testing center set up outside the hospital by the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]]. During a short break, Jo practiced her speech to convince Bailey to let her switch specialities on him. When a patient of Levi's test came back positive, Levi wanted to have him admitted since the patient lived with his family of six, including his grandfather, in a two-bedroom apartment. Since admitting him was not an option, Jackson handed Levi his credit card and told him to book the patient and any other patient in need a hotel room on him. Soon, the hotel manager asked if he just wanted to book an entire floor. [[Sara Ortiz]] got angry at Jackson when she heard about his actions, stating they hurt organizations for the underprivileged that had a struck a deal with hotel for discounts. Levi stood up for Jackson but Jackson was interested to hear her out. After work, Jo offered him a ride but he ended up biking home anyway because Richard asked Jo to talk about her switching specialties.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nLevi was tasked with accompanying a vastly asleep Meredith in the hyperbaric chamber, an ultimate attempt to get her to wake up. The room was double-booked so they were joined by [[James Chee]] and a patient who was healing from a post-op wound infection. Levi had been warned by Teddy and Bailey not to cause Meredith any stress. As they sat there, James asked about the kind of teacher Meredith was. Levi described her as the most influential teacher he had ever had, stating her voice echoed in his mind with every win he booked. Soon after, James' patient's sedation unexpectedly wore off and her movement caused her abdominal wound to open up with a subsequent evisceration. Recalling a similar experience, he remember Meredith's instructions and correctly handled the situation while the chamber was de-pressurized. Afterward, Jo found him as she'd heard he had saved a life. He told her that he wondered what Meredith would have done, which guided him to do the right thing. Jo recognized that from her own residency and then revealed she was serious about switching specialties.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\nJo and Levi developed a habit of watching movies together after work, though Levi often cancelled as he had begun meeting up with Nico again. After a night of hanging out, Nico waited for Levi at the hospital entrance and returned the bag he had left at his place the night before, stating it was in the way. Levi told Jo he hated how Nico wouldn't even allow him to have a drawer at his place. During the day, Levi worked with [[Erika Swift]], a patient who took the pandemic as an opportunity to turn her life around. During surgery, Levi told Bailey that that was what Jo wanted to do by switching specialties. Levi used Erika's story to confront Nico about being afraid to take the leap and carve out some space in his life for Levi. Nico realized he was right and asked Levi to move in, suddenly giving Levi cold feet. He made up an excuse about having to spend time with Jo and promptly left.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi's personality can be described as sweet and nerdy, but at times, through the eyes of his fellow surgeons, can be seen as clumsy and bumbling. Overall, he is very earnest with a kind heart, and always tries to prove himself at work.\n\n\n\n[[Nico Kim]]\nNico winked at Levi while operating, which confused him.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nLater, at Joe's bar, Nico bought him a beer after a rough day. Levi wanted to pay him back and grabbed his wallet, but Nico touched his hand to stop him and said Levi could buy the next one. Nico then left, with Levi staring after him.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nNico later came into the residents' locker room to shower despite having access to the fellows' lounge and Levi was shocked and distracted by seeing Nico with no shirt.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Nico then asked Levi if he would be willing to get that drink that evening, but Levi said he might have plans later. Nico just said he'd be a Joe's if his thing got cancelled. Later, Levi came to the bar for that drink, but Nico mostly brushed him off, confusing Levi.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nAfter working together on [[J.J. Williams]], Levi and Nico ended up in an elevator together and they kissed. They stopped when someone else got on the elevator, but once they were alone again, Nico apologized for what he'd done. Levi said it was fine and also that it was his first time and he was happy to learn. However, Nico said he didn't want to teach him.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nAfter being trapped together in an ambulance during the windstorm, Levi talked about having feelings for men before, but never exploring it because he was a nerd and never considered sex much at all. After his confession, Nico kissed him and the two of them had sex in the ambulance.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nTheir relationship continued to develop. Levi ultimately declared himself gay and happy while he was assisting on a surgery.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Levi's mother called while he was hooking up with Nico, Nico was upset when Levi shushed him. Levi tried to explain why his mother didn't know about Nico, but Nico wasn't persuaded and left. Later that day, Levi explained to Nico that his mother likes to talk about everything as if it's going to hurt him and he wants to lock Nico in in his own eyes before inviting his mother's criticisms because Nico's his first love. Hearing that Levi loved him, Nico kissed him and they started to walk away. Levi asked if he's not going to say it back. He said he would, but he wanted to make Levi sweat for a minute first.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nLevi learned that Nico had an upcoming job interview with a hospital in San Francisco, and expressed worry about a long-distance relationship through bringing up sports teams. While together on a case in which Nico had to fill the man's body with cement, Levi continued complaining about Nico's proposed move. Later, it was revealed that Nico made a mistake during the surgery, and the patient collapsed. Bailey ordered Levi to fix the man, as he was the grandson of a friend of hers, but things didn't go well, and the patient died. Later, Nico was about to do a Skype interview with his new prospective boss, and Levi attempted to persuade him to leave and re-schedule the interview. Nico spoke sharply to Levi, saying that he was not a failure, and implied that Levi is, which broke his heart. Levi was angered when Nico started the interview, and slammed the door behind him.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nNico was annoyed that he is relegated to simple tasks in the wake of his surgical error. Levi, on a high due to him saving the Seattle Fire Chief, ran to tell Nico about it. However, Nico didn't want to hear it and was rude to Levi, and demanded Levi's help in fixing a shoulder dislocation. Later, Link told Levi to leave Nico alone, and that if he wanted to talk, he should wait for him to say so.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nNico later realized via Link that his past behavior had been unacceptable, in the wake of a fog throughout Seattle, which led to a massive car pile-up on the freeway. He tracked Levi down, only for Levi to give him the cold shoulder, which immediately turned into lecturing on Levi's end when Nico informed him that he missed him. Levi told Nico about his day, and Nico listened, which culminated in Levi informing Nico that he loved him, but he still deserved better than how Nico had treated him. Nico came clean about his personal anger due to his failure, and that he was jealous of other doctors in the hospital, Levi especially, due to their ability to bond with patients and have successful moments. Levi immediately told Nico that he could help him, and wanted to. Later, the two tearfully watched ''My Girl'' in Levi's basement, and his mother came downstairs with chicken noodle soup. She was very welcoming towards Nico, but called him Levi's \"friend\". Levi immediately informed his mother that Nico was his boyfriend that Nico was the one who has been having a bad day. Mrs. Schmitt then offered up the chicken soup to Nico, after he informed her that he liked it, telling Levi that they would talk later. Nico told Levi that he was \"amazing,\" and Levi put his head on Nico's shoulder.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi's family is very close. They all contributed money to get him through his medical education, which makes them very invested in his career.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\n[[Myrna Schmitt]]\nHe lived in his mother's basement<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref> but moved out later on. \n\n[[Saul]]\n[[Saul]] is Levi's uncle who died from end-stage heart failure. Right before dying, Levi visited him and came out to him by introducing [[Nico Kim|Nico]] as his boyfriend.\n\n\n[[Jo Wilson]]\nHe had a one-night stand with [[Jo Wilson]] after coming to the bar to apologize to her.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nHe later returned her badge to her, which embarrassed her. When he came to her later about a potential donor he had found, she took the case from him, upsetting him.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nAfter finding out from [[Olivia Jankovic]] that [[Alex Karev|Alex]] had had syphilis in the past, he was worried he should get himself checked. Jo assured him she didn't have syphilis.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Levi broke up with Nico and Jo was left by Alex she invited Levi to move in with her, assuring him that he was getting the invite because he was gay and she just needed someone to share her space with.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> The two swiftly established a close friendship, although Jo still yelled at Levi when he wasn't pulling his weight at the hospital.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\n\nLevi first came to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] as a fourth-year medical student doing a six-week rotation as a [[Clerkship|sub-intern.]] Later, he interviewed for a spot in the hospital's residency program and was accepted.\n\n\n*He is the second male openly gay main character in the Grey's Anatomy universe, just after [[Travis Montgomery]] from ''[[Station ]]''.\n*He was the first Grey's Anatomy character to meet [[Andy Herrera]] on screen.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n*Levi is in the top % of his medical school program.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n*Levi had a tendency to let his glasses slip off from his face, something he resolved with a sports band.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*Due to a high cost of living and medical school, Levi lived in the basement of his mother's house at the start of his internship.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n**[[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] compared him to [[George O'Malley|George]] when she slept with the latter during [[What Have I Done to Deserve This?|intern-year]] when she found out about [[Jo Wilson|Jo]] sleeping with the former.\n**Prior to living with Meredith, George also lived in his parents' house.\n*His blood type is O-.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref>\n*He is Jewish.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n*He takes fish oil every day.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n*He ate double cheeseburgers every day in freshman year.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n*He once dressed as a sunflower for Halloween.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxLeviSchmitt.png\nxLeviSchmitt.png\nxLeviSchmitt.png\nSxLeviSchmitt.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Levi-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\n*[[The Last Supper]]\n*[[Living In a House Divided]]\n\n\n:'''Levi to ([[Nico Kim|Nico]]);''' I'm not done. You know what's also your fault? The fact that you think I have a shame spiral, because I don't. I'm not spiraling. I'm a nerd. I'm no more ashamed of being attracted to guys than I am of anything else in my life. Do you know what I did almost every night before I went to college? I sat in my mom's basement with three other debate-club kids playing Dungeons & Dragons, and it's the same basement I live in now. Trust me when I say no one was having sex. With guys or girls. Sex was like the Sunsword. It's a magical weapon in the game that's really hard to find. It's basically like a talking light saber, but... Never mind, doesn't matter. The point is sex wasn't on the table for us. So I didn't know I was gay. I knew that I had feelings for boys, but I didn't understand it. Not until you kissed me. You kissed me, and I felt the opposite of shame. I felt like I existed and everything fell in place. For the first time, it felt like I was holding the Sunsword, and I kno-- Are you just kissing me to get me to stop talking?<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n----\n:'''Levi to ([[Miranda Bailey|Miranda]]):''' I'm not a great Jew. I cheated at my bar mitzvah. I was too busy trying to ignore Lenny Rapkin's shins that I didn't learn Hebrew, so I just wrote it out phonetically and read that instead. I skip half the High Holy Days and repent for it at Yom Kippur. And if I'm honest, I go back and forth about believing in God, which is actually very Jewish, but... It\us the traditions that I find helpful. When a loved one dies, we have rules about how to grieve and move on. Protocols. We force ourselves to sit in the pain. We cry. And we laugh.

After she ended things, she cried every day, which she thinks might be the reason she didn't notice his laugh changing.

Due to his autism, he wouldn't let the doctors examine him, so Alex used his love of buildings and LEGOs to talk to him. Gus was able to use LEGOs to show Alex that he had significant pain in his chest. They ran a chest CT, which showed a thymoma, which Maggie noted is always malignant in children, but curable with surgery. However, before they could operate, he needed a blood transfusion as he was anemic. They got him blood, but he rejected it because it wasn't the right type. They re-typed his blood and showed AB, but with no Rh antigen, a very rare occurrence. Before he could have surgery, they needed to find blood donors who were an exact match to his blood so he wouldn't reject it. They identified only four potential donors, but Alex promised his parents they'd keep looking until they found the blood he needed. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\nThe wait was thought to be over when a call came in from Canada from a doctor treating a patient who was also Rh<sub>null</sub>. However, this was a misunderstanding and the doctor was hoping to find a donor for her patient, not offering her patient as a donor. When Gus's mother found out about the error, she was upset. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nA blood donor was finally found for Gus, but she was located in London and had severe agoraphobia. She was flown to the United States with her therapist, but when there was an issue with his visa, they were separated. When Lori found out about this, she knocked over one of Gus's LEGO towers in frustration, scattering the bricks across the floor. Scott went to clean them up, but slipped and fell, breaking his coccyx. He was taken into surgery. While he was there, Gus had a heart attack because of the lack of blood in his body and his organs started to fail, so he was taken to the hyperbaric chamber in order to buy him enough time to wait for the transfusion. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nIn the hyperbaric chamber, Gus was able to get more oxygen to his organs. However, he still coded, so they started decompressing the chamber as Frances was still on her way to the hospital with Owen. Alex did chest compressions and refused to stop until the blood had been transfused, at which point, he went back into sinus rhythm and regained consciousness. He immediately started to get stronger and his mother and Frances both watched as he was able to play a video game in his bed.

''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\n\nMabel participated in a skills lab at Grey Sloan. During the lab, she corrected [[Zander Perez]] on something and got Richard to back her up, though they both noticed he didn't seem enthused to be working with them. He later sent them all home early. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\nLater, Mabel did another skills lab with the other residents, though they didn't take it seriously. That same day, she also rounded on [[Ava Gutierrez]] with Richard Webber. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\n\nMabel was among the medical staff in the gallery watching Richard's explantation and hip replacement. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a shipment of PPE arrived at the hospital, which they expected to contain masks and gloves, Tom assigned Mabel and Taryn to guard it as they opened it. However, when thy opened the boxes, they learned it was all booties and no masks. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nMabel was briefly on Meredith's case after she was diagnosed with Covid- before a new rule was implemented disallowing interns and residents to work on any patients with Covid or suspected Covid. Later, while waiting in line to be tested for Covid, Mabel was pulled out of line to teach [[Sara Ortiz]] the proper way to don and doff PPE after Owen noticed she was not wearing it properly. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Dave Oyadomari]] came back into the ER after falling off a stepladder and injuring himself, Mabel ended up on the case. Due to his being Asian, she quickly realized he'd been misdiagnosed with appendicitis due to a prior ER visit and instead had right-sided diverticulitis, which had perforated after he was sent home. Owen allowed her to scrub in due to her catching the correct diagnosis. After Dave's surgery, Mabel went to talk to Owen about how his medical care, which was centered on European norms, had led to Dave being seriously injured, causing him a month off work that would otherwise have been avoided. However, before she could confront him, Nico sent her out of the room, having previously advised her not to risk her residency over it. Instead, he confronted Owen himself. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Tad (Station )|Tad]] was shot in the head with an arrow, Mabel greeted the aid car in the ambulance bay. When she saw they'd rigged a hammock in the aid car to hold his head up as it couldn't rest flat on the gurney, she called it genius. She told the firefighters that she had trauma and neurosurgery waiting for him. ''(\"[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Chad Anderson]] was brought to the ER with COVID symptoms after collapsing while jogging, Mabel treated him in the ER, though he mistook her for a nurse. Later, when Chad signed himself out against medical advice, Mabel treated him again just outside the hospital when he collapsed again. He died shortly afterward. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them  seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total,  patients were treated using this method. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nThe residents enjoyed this new teaching method and eagerly awaited each day. Mabel did an echo on Vic Hughes's heart after she was electrocuted at a scene. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nMabel and Levi went to a recruitment fair, where they explained The Webber Method and how it allowed the residents to get more experience and treat more patients in less time. The medical students were confused by their explanation and failed to understand how it was better than other programs. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\nMabel was assigned to work on a heart transplant. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhen The Webber Method resulted in the death of [[Devon Gomez]], Mabel attended an M&M conference to determine how they could prevent it from happening again. After the conference, Mabel worked with Amelia on [[Francesca Lyons]], who had severe lower back pain which was eventually attributed to endometriosis. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Levi quit, the other residents were only getting assigned simple procedures, which they considered a form of punishment. When Richard didn't show up for work, they questioned what they were supposed to do. Meredith, who was operating on [[David Hamilton]] that day, went to Hamilton and asked if she could use his surgery as a teaching opportunity and allow all hospital staff to observe. The residents were eager to be part of this. Before the surgery started, Meredith explained what they were doing and gave them time to ask questions. The surgery then proceeded and went well. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nMabel worked on the case of [[Laura Eames]], who was  weeks pregnant with mitral valve insufficiency. She scrubbed in on Laura's surgery. While they were workin on Laura, they talked about Laura trying to set her brother up with Jo. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the residents learned that [[Fernanda Lima|Fernanda Lima's]] surgery had been changed from a Ross Procedure to a Ross-Konno Procedure, they were eager to watch it. However, Owen came to them and told them to go see patients to help cover the physician shortage. Specifically, he said that Mabel was supposed to be covering the ICU and hadn't turned in her monthly case load report. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nMabel and the other residents were called to do grand rounds with [[Nick Marsh]] and [[Meredith Grey]]. They arrived to find Nick with the patient, Mason Taylor, who was brain dead after being struck by a drunk driver. His wife wanted to donate his organs, but UNOS rejected them, so she donated his body for research. Nick explained that they would be transplanting a genetically modified pig kidney into Mason's body in the hopes that they could perfect the technology, which would eliminate the wait for donor organs. He transplanted the kidney near the groin so they had better blood supply and could see the kidney as they waited to see if it would work. After the surgery, they celebrated that the kidney was producing urine. When the kidney later stopped working, Nick had them do a biopsy and sent the residents away to avoid screaming at them. Then he did everything he could to save the kidney, but started to lose faith. Meredith suggested using epinephrine, which worked and Jordan reported that the kidney was working again. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Mabel learned that [[Alice Tom]] was bring treated at the hospital after being attacked at a bus stop for being Asian-American, she decided to stay at the hospital to watch her surgery instead of going home. While she watched, she told Levi that no one stopped to help Alice or call for help or even record the attack. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nMabel was working the day [[Jamarah Blake]] returned to the hospital to evaluate the residency program. She donated blood that day in an attempt to help lessen the burden of the blood shortage. Then she watched Meredith and Nick attempt to remove [[Cora|Cora's]] pancreatic tumor in an ex-vivo surgery. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\nShe later helped the other residents get the word out on social media that the hospital needed blood, drawing in several donors. At the end of the day, when the surgical residency program was shut down, she packed up her things. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\n\nHer grandparents were sent to an interment camp at Jerome. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nShe's a second-year [[Resident|resident]]. She was working at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]]. When it was purchased, she came over to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to interview to keep her job.

She frequently called Meredith \"Mer-Mer\" as a child and watched her grow up. Marie threw Meredith an eighth birthday party where she filled the entire bedroom floor to ceiling with balloons. Marie recalled Meredith being a \"disembodied giggle\" over it.\n\nIn her professional life, she worked on the laparoscopic biliary reconstruction with Ellis. This medical procedure became known as the Ellis Grey Procedure. The procedure was nominated for and later won a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], Ellis' second and final win. Marie, however, did not receive any credit for her contribution. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\n\nMarie came to Seattle to meet with Meredith when Meredith asked for use of her polymer in research. When she arrived, she and Meredith realized they knew each other when Meredith was a child because Marie and Ellis were best friends. They caught up on the lost time and then Meredith made her proposal. Marie was still unconvinced, and so Meredith had [[Taryn Helm]] bring out the mouse they had saved by secretly using Marie's polymer.\n\nMarie then agreed that it was revolutionary and said after she had a good night's sleep, they'd meet and talk business. However, Meredith learned shortly afterward from [[Richard Webber]] that Marie and Ellis hated each other, which is why they were no longer best friends, and that Marie had likely stolen Meredith's idea. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith asked her about it, Marie said that Ellis had stolen the idea for the surgical innovation that won her her second Harper Avery. They had developed it together, but Ellis published the research solo before Marie could publish it jointly. In exchange, Marie wanted Meredith to announce Marie's contribution publicly and change the name of the procedure to the Grey-Cerone Method. Meredith told her she couldn't undo her mother's legacy without being able to hear her side of it. Marie then decided she would use her company's resources to fully develop the mini-livers before Meredith could do so and have them known as Cerones. ''([[Old Scars, Future Hearts]])'' \n\n\nWhen Meredith gave a presentation of her mini-livers, Marie attended. During the presentation, Meredith informed everyone about Marie's contribution to Ellis' surgical method and announced that she wanted the method to be now known as the Grey-Cerone Method<ref>Although called the Ellis Grey Procedure in \"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\", Meredith calls it the Grey Method, which is how it is referred to in every other instance.</ref>. After the presentation, Marie tried to talk to Meredith, but Meredith said she'd said everything she wanted to say. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith reached out to Marie in Spain to inquire if she could help her out on her quest to find Rhnull blood for [[Gus Carter]], but to no avail. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\n\n\nMarie never married and never cared much for romantic relationships. ''([[Old Scars, Future Hearts]])'' \n\n\nShe went back to Spain after time in the US because her father wanted her to run his company. Later, she took over ownership when her father died. She considered her father's death to be timely, as he had been sick for a long time. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\nShe and [[Ellis Grey]] were best friends for many years. Marie considered Ellis to be the greatest love of her life. ''([[Old Scars, Future Hearts]])'' Sometime after Meredith's eighth birthday, they had a falling out.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMarie considered Meredith to be the closest thing she had to having children. She was very fond of her, and watched her work over the years as she grew into a surgeon. \n\n\nShe is an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]].\n\nWhen she and Ellis Grey worked together, she was sexually harassed by [[Harper Avery]] and was eventually paid a settlement as a result of that. Ellis Grey left her name off the paper publishing their work in order to win a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], which Marie was ineligible to win, ending their friendship and resulting in Marie returning to Spain to run her father\us company. At a presentation she was giving on her mini-livers, [[Meredith Grey]] announced that the Grey Method would be known as the Grey-Cerone Method to acknowledge Marie's contributions.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxMarieCerone.png|[[Games People Play]]\nxMarieCerone.png|[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\nxMarieCerone.png|[[Fight For Your Mind]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Marie Cerone Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Marie Cerone]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cerone, Marie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

''(\"[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]]\")''\n\nDesperate, Andrew called in [[Lauren Riley]], an expert diagnostician from UCSF. After having Maggie do a pericardial window to relieve the pressure of the fluid around her heart, Lauren said they need to withdraw all treatment, so that they could see the symptoms without the medications. Suzanne was reluctant, but ultimately agreed to let them withdraw all treatments. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\nSuzanne's previously treated symptoms started to appear again, causing discomfort. They continued to run tests, which still didn't show anything conclusive. Finally, after Andrew noticed that Suzanne's platelet count had dropped almost to zero, they did a bone marrow biopsy. That showed hemophagocytosis, a result of macrophage activation syndrome, a known complication of Still's disease, which she had prior to the appendectomy without knowing it. They have her high-dose steroids, which caused her to feel better almost immediately and said she'd be referred to a rheumatologist to manage her condition. Her kids were both excited to get to see her healthy again.

During her interview, they were surprised she'd never run a department on her own, but had rather assisted the department head, but she defended that Bailey had never been chief until she was. The interview was interrupted when Richard came in and asked Michelle to scrub in on an emergency surgery on [[Brad DiMarco]], who had injured his face when a firework went off. They continued the interview in the OR, as she said she thinks more clearly in there. In the surgery, she became inpatient with Levi when she had to ask multiple times for instruments.\n\nAfter she completed the surgery, Bailey officially offered her the job, but she turned it down, saying their residents weren't at the level she required, as she heavily depended on residents in her work. Richard said that happened because the pandemic stole an entire year from them and he promised he would catch them up. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nDespite her resistance, Michelle took the job at Grey Sloan. During the heat wave, she treated [[Chet]], who had burned his butt and upper thighs on the hot sidewalk while filming a video for social media. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nMichelle later went with Bailey to a recruitment fair to try to court medical students to apply to their program. She helped Bailey talk about the program and hand out brochures, to minimal interest. Michelle encouraged Bailey to publicize the Webber Method, in the hopes it would draw potential candidates in. Bailey had Levi and Mabel come and demonstrate how the Method worked, but the medical students were unable to understand how it was better than what other programs offered. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\n\nLin attended the M&M that discussed the death of [[Devon Gomez]]. She questioned use of the Webber Method, despite having used it as a recruitment tool for new residents. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nLin worked on [[Alice Tom]] when she came into the ER after being attacked at a bus stop for being Asian-American. Alice had severe facial trauma, requiring surgery. As Lin operated, she shared her experience as a child wondering if she could use her mother's make-up to look more American, which in her mind meant more white. After Nico shared feelings of also feeling like an outsider, BokHee assured them both that their faces were American faces. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nAt her former hospital, she served as the [[Attending#Department Head|assistant head]] of [[Plastic Surgery|plastics]]. She described her previous head of plastics as a man who enjoys vacation homes and only hired women because he was obligated. Some time before that, she completed her [[Resident|residency]] in [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngology]] at NYU, where her mentor, Dr. Joyce Wu, taught her how to use an -gauge needle to differentiate between living and dead tissue, even in the most extreme of cases. She then went on to complete a [[Fellow|plastics fellowship]].\n\nWhen she manages residents as an attending, she moves quickly and teaches by doing. Her style of teaching relies on the residents' abilities to keep up as she does not have the time to go through each step in detail nor hold their hands. Given the high-level surgeries in her caseload and practice, she expects her residents to anticipate her next move. \n\nDuring her interview at Grey-Sloan, she was granted surgical privileges by [[Richard Webber|Dr. Webber]] on an emergent plastics case. After her interview, she was offered the head of plastics position, but expressed a concern of the residents' competency given her management style. Despite Dr. Webber committing to fast-track their education, she asked for some time to consider the offer. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nShe eventually accepted the position, and she is currently the Head of Plastic Surgery and an [[Attending|attending]] [[Otolaryngology|ENT surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].

He previously worked at [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota.\n\n\n\nFive weeks after having a kidney transplant, Nick came to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to retrieve a liver for a long-time patient of his. After the surgery, he collapsed in a hallway because he returned to work earlier than recommended. Meredith did an exam and ran some labs. He flirted with her and they talked and laughed while waiting for the results to come back and they got to know a bit about each other. His labs were inconclusive, so Meredith did another ultrasound, which showed a clot in his renal vein cutting off blood flow to his new kidney. While she rushed him into surgery, Nick entrusted Meredith with the code for his niece's college fund and asked her to make sure Charlotte attended college, just in case he didn't make it. His worry was unnecessary though, as she was able to remove the clot and save his kidney.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\">[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\n\nNick was leaving a bad date at the restaurant where Meredith was having dinner with [[David Hamilton]]. When he was leaving, they exchanged a brief look. Intent on meeting her, he took a chance and guessed she would be staying at the five-star hotel near the hospital. He waited for her at the bar and had an employee escort her to the bar upon her arrival. She said thought he hadn't seen her, but he replied that she's hard to miss. Over drinks, he told her about his terrible date while when she mentioned that she had recently ended a relationship. He told her that Charlotte wanted him to thank her for saving his life saying that's the deepest conversation he could get from her from a loud dorm. Meredith was happy for him since when they first met, he told her he wanted for his niece to go to college. Even though he was happy for Charlotte, he said his house felt too quiet. Meredith talked about having survived COVID and Nick understood the pressure she was feeling to make the most of her life after her miraculous survival. After another drink, he escorted her to her room. She shared that she was staying for a few more days and repeated she would not be inviting him, which wasn't his intent. They flirted a little as he walked off.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], x</ref>\n\nHe returned to her hotel room to slide a note under her door but got caught since she was still awake. He wanted to ask her out on a date without waking her up since he had forgotten to ask for her number. She agreed to a date by the lake. Later in the day, she glanced at Nick while walking Amelia back to the car. In the evening, she arrived in the hotel lobby all dressed up only to spot him in casual clothes. He asked her to change and drove her out to his favorite spot by the water. As they listened to the sounds of nature and stargazed, he said he had pulled back on his hours to enjoy life more because he was missing the good little things around him. He then inquired about the top secret project that she was in town for. She admitted to being scared of saying yes due to fear of public failure given the high stakes. Nick knew her well enough to know that she was ready to trade in her safe and comfortable situation in Seattle for the project. He wasn't a safety person either and told her it would be one hell of a ride no matter the outcome. Later that night, she accepted Hamilton's offer.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith ended up accepting the position in Minnesota, splitting her time between there and Seattle. Nick ran into her in the parking lot after having just performed a liver transplant. He invited her to dinner that night. She accepted and told him to get some rest, after which she headed into the building as he smilingly stared after her.<ref>[[With a Little Help From My Friends]], x</ref>\n\nWhen David threw a tantrum, Meredith sought out Nick to gain intel on David. Nick knew that Hamilton has Parkinson's and was using a lot of his money on the project. Seeing who was involved in the project, he assumed that David Hamilton wanted a solution to his problem. Meredith was surprised that Nick knew anything about her project. He told her that David was not in it for the greater good. Meredith was disappointed that she fell for his charm and thought of him as an investor rather than a desperate surgeon. Nick pointed out how hard it must be for David to feel himself become obsolete and advised her to cut him some slack yet not let him walk over her. She took his advice and smoothed things over with David. At the end of the day, they met on a rooftop terrace for another date and ended up sharing their first kiss.<ref>[[Bottle Up and Explode!]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the success with the Parkinson's Project, when David Hamilton offered Meredith a position at Mayo, she decided to accept the offer, as she felt that people at Grey Sloan still saw her as the intern she once was. Knowing that the residency program was struggling, Nick suggested that Meredith stay until the program was secure. He also offered to help cover staff shortages.<ref>[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]], x</ref> Despite their efforts, the residency program was shut down and Bailey quit, so Jackson offered Meredith a job as Chief of Surgery. She decided to stay and told Nick to go back to Minnesota.<ref>[[You Are the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAfter six months without talking to each other, they met again due during a big bus accident which led multiple organ donors to Grey Sloan with several transplant surgeons there, including Nick. Meredith asked him to stay and do a triple organ transplant for a patient of hers since it was the first day of the new residency program and she couldn't be away in a OR for so many hours. After this long procedure, Nick thanked Meredith for the surgery because it was the first time he had done a triple organ transplant. She stopped him when he tried to leave, asking him stay and offering him the job of Residency Program Director at Grey Sloan, saying he was the best for the job.<ref>[[Everything Has Changed]], x</ref> After thinking about it, he said yes and started working at Grey Sloan. To Meredith surprise, he was professional towards her, while she expected an email or for him to go to her office, so at the end of the day, she paged him to talk about a budget request for new component of the residency program. Then she segued into her asking him why he he barely spoke to her all day. They got interrupted by Owen and seeing how busy Meredith was, Nick told her to talk to him if she had any doubts about the program. Before he could leave the office, she asked him to talk. He said they didn't have time for that \"back and forth\" because people were always asking for her. Meredith told him that when he got back to Minnesota, she went numb and that's why she didn't call him and assured him that she still loved him. Nick asked her to dinner but she said no, but instead she asked him to go with her to Zola's presentation for the North Pacific scholars, which he accepted.<ref>[[Wasn't Expecting That]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe sees himself as an easy person to talk to and he isn't a comfortable person. Nick sees adventures as something that can go well or poorly, but either way he likes to try and do it so he can know if the outcome is worth it. \n\n\n\nWhile he was in the hospital, he flirted heavily with Meredith and the two chatted for hours as they waited for his lab results. At the end of the day, Meredith confided in Alex that Nick made her feel something for the first time since she lost Derek.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" />\n\nWhen Meredith began traveling frequently to Minnesota to develop a cure for Parkinson's, they struck up a relationship. \n\nWhen he told Meredith he was falling in love with her, he mentioned that he doesn't fall in love easily and he has done so very rarely in his life.\n\nEven with the distance from Seattle and Minnesota, their relationship got developing and after the success of the Parkinson's project, Meredith got an offer from [[David Hamilton]] so she could join [[Mayo Clinic]] as Chief of General Surgery and have control over [[The Grey Center]]. After some time, she decided to leave and take the new job without knowing the residency program at Grey Sloan was on probation. Nick saw how the people in the hospital felt about her leaving and he didn't want her to resent him in the future so he moved to Seattle, using his personal days off and working locum tenens at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to help her and the hospital so the program would not be shut down and she could leave without feeling guilty or in bad terms with the people she knows. \n\nDespite their work, the residency program got shut down, Bailey quit, giving Meredith the key of the chief's office and Jackson pressured her to stay and save the place. Meredith told Nick to go back to Minnesota because she had a lot of work to do for the hospital.<ref>[[You Are the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nFor the next six months, neither of them tried to contact the other until Nick came back to Seattle to retrieve an organ. Maggie saw him in line talking with Winston while waiting for his turn and went to Meredith's office to tell her to go talk with him, adding that even Zola noticed how sad Meredith had been and had asked her for Nick's phone number so she could call him and ask him to return. Meredith went to Nick and asked him to do a triple organ transplant on her patient and he agreed. After the transplant was completed, Meredith offered Nick a job as an attending and Director of the Residency Program, an offer he accepted.<ref>[[Everything Has Changed]], x</ref> On Nick's first day at Grey Sloan, to Meredith surprise, he was professional towards her, while she expected an email or for him to go to her office, so at the end of the day, she paged him to talk about a budget request for new component of the residency program.

Nick asked her to dinner but she said no, but instead she asked him to go with her to Zola's presentation for the North Pacific scholars, which he accepted.<ref>[[Wasn't Expecting That]], x</ref>\n\n\nHis father used to take him to the Boundary Waters between Minnesota and Canada. His dad would get a look on his face that Nick would like to experience.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" /> His dad left his family when Nick was  years old.<ref>[[Haunted]], x</ref>\n\nHis mother died when he was fifteen of heart failure while waiting for a heart transplant. He  described her as \"impossibly smart\" and he likes to think she's proud of him.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" /> Until his father left him and his mother, his neighborhood was his whole world. After Nick's father left, his mother bought an RV and over spring break, they went to the Grand Canyon. Until then, he'd never been outside of Minnesota and it made him realize there was this big beautiful world were no one knew or cared he was the kid whose dad left him. His mother showed him there was more than the place and realities he knew and he was thankful for her gesture.<ref>[[Haunted]], x</ref>\n\nAfter his sister, Erica, bailed due to her struggles with drug dependency, he took in his niece, Charlotte, and raised her as his own saying it was the best thing he ever did. She was sixteen at the time of his hospitalization.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" /> He doesn't see his sister much because she has an uncanny ability to break his heart and enrage him all in once. Whether she's sober or not, she lies to him without remorse. Despite that, he struggles to say no when she asks for something and so the distance he established is the easiest way to avoid a heartbreak and to keep his and Charlotte's lives on track.<ref name=\"Stronger Than Hate\" />     \n\nHe is very protective of Charlotte and always did his best for her. When Nick took Meredith to his cabin for a romantic weekend, Charlotte showed up with her boyfriend whom Nick hadn't met before and didn't like very much. Over dinner, his niece told him she wanted to leave college for a while so she could travel and spend some time in Costa Rica. Nick wanted her to finish school first, causing a conflict between the two of them. Later that night, Meredith told Charlotte she reminded of herself at that age. Meredith encouraged them to talk and Charlotte explained to Nick that she wanted to get a chance to mess up a little alone without him telling her what was good for her. He explained that he did it so she didn't have to struggle and to help her keep from becoming like her mother, but Charlotte stopped him and asked him to give himself some credit because if it weren't for him, she couldn't even dream about traveling the world. She assured him she would get back to college, that he did a great job raising her, and she was grateful for him. Nick agreed to give her more space, but asked to meet her the next week so they could talk about the places she would be visiting in Costa Rica.<ref>[[The Makings of You]]</ref>\n\n\nHis [[Brian Williams (Today Was a Fairytale)|best friend]] donated a kidney to him. They have been friends since they were five years old, used to go camping every summer and played Little League together.<ref>[[Today Was a Fairytale]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe is a world-class [[Transplant Surgery|transplant surgeon]]<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" />. During his [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]], he had a fondness for all the [[Specialties#Surgical Specialty|specialities]], especially [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardio]] and [[Neurosurgery|neuro]], but he couldn't sit still and wanted to travel, which transplant surgery afforded him.\n\nAs an attending, he teaches that the organ isn't just an organ. He insists on teaching his students that to be a great transplant surgeon, it's important to remember that an organ it's one of the greatest gifts a human being can give to another human being and they can not forget the person who gave the gifts. Unlike most of the transplant surgeons, when he has the opportunity, Nick likes to meet the people who have lost someone, offer his condolences, and get to know a little about the person who is donating the organs.<ref>[[Legacy]], x</ref>\n\nHe was involved in a study on liver transplant with HIV-Positive organ donors and recipients that required a lot of travel.<ref>[[The Makings of You]], x</ref>\n\nHe is studying stem cell therapies and xenotransplantation and successfully did a xenotransplantation with a genetically-modified pig kidney.<ref>[[Put It to the Test]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the residency program at Grey Sloan restarted, six months after the shut down, Meredith offered Nick the job to be in charge of the program because she said he was the best teacher she knows and how much he cares about people.<ref>[[Everything Has Changed]], x</ref> Nick accepted the position.<ref>[[Wasn't Expecting That]], x</ref>\n\n\n*He was on dialysis for only a month before his kidney transplant.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" />\n*He believes that doctors make the worst patients.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" /> \n*After his kidney transplant, surgery and his niece Charlotte were his priorities.<ref>[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]], x</ref>\n*He was the first member of his family to go to college.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" />\n*Nick did his residency in D.C. and his fellowship in Minnesota.<ref name=\"Stronger Than Hate\" />\n*Before his mother died, he had never considered a career in medicine.<ref>[[Let's Talk About Sex]], x</ref>\n*His plan B was to be a shoe salesman.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" />\n*He likes to fly.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" />\n*He declared himself \"too math-dumb\" to pull Charlotte out of a hole in her Calculus class, when asked if he wanted to call someone when he got hospitalized at Grey-Sloan.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" />\n*He likes to cook.<ref>[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]], x</ref>\n*He likes running and cycling.<ref name=\"Stronger Than Hate\">[[Stronger Than Hate]], x</ref>\n*He kept his important documents in the third drawer of a green cabinet at his place in Minnesota.<ref name=\"One Day Like This\" />\n*The cabin was his first big purchase.

Link used his experience working at a bike shop to take the bike apart to free her. They then took her into surgery to put an external fixator on her broken leg. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\nLink was later angry to learn that Jackson had taken Nisha into the hyperbaric chamber without notifying him. Link and Nico watched as Jackson worked on debriding her wound. When Nisha started coding, Link figured out that the source was her external fixator, to which the infection had spread. Unfortunately, it was too late and Nisha died in the hyperbaric chamber. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\n\nNico examined [[Arthur Krug]] in the ER and told him that he hadn't broken any of the bones in his face. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\n\nNico worked on the case of [[J.J. Williams]], who broke his arm trying to climb a fence. His arm was broken, which they confirmed with an x-ray. However, the x-ray also showed a mass, which a biopsy confirmed was cancerous. They told him and his mother and J.J. was worried about going bald, prompting Link to cut his own hair and let J.J. help him. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the wind storm, Levi was sent to the clinic with Nico to clear it of patients. He and Nico argued over a patient as they worked, but Levi insisted he could handle it because he had experience. After taking a patient to peds, Nico came back to make sure Levi got back okay. After Levi said he'd wait it out in the clinic, Nico went to leave and got swept away as soon as he took one step outside. Levi crawled to him and then helped him get into a nearby ambulance. In the ambulance, Levi said he didn't know he was gay when he was young because he didn't have the opportunity to explore the feelings he had. After his speech, Nico kissed him again. Then they had sex in the ambulance. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nAfter the storm had calmed somewhat, they were startled when Alex came into the ambulance to escape the wind. They worried they'd be fired, but at the end of the day, Alex told them what they did was unacceptable and instructed them to use a room with locks in the future. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the wind storm, the power went out, trapping people in elevators. However, when the power came back, the elevators did not immediately start working again. Dahlia and Jackson found the elevator where [[Phoebe Moss]] was trapped with Bailey and Taryn and, with Link's help, started trying to get the elevator open. [[Jed Lundberg]] tried to stop them until he learned that the elevator contained organs for Cece. He then helped them get the trapped people out. After they were out, he tried to haul himself out, but before he completely cleared the elevator shaft, the elevator started working again and came down on his legs. They were able to get him free with his legs still attached. Nico helped while Link and Jackson operated and found a way to let him keep both his legs. After his surgery, Jed had nerve function in his foot, which was a sign the surgery worked. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n\nNico worked on the case of [[Natasha Deon]], who had fallen from a hotel balcony and broken her pelvis. In the OR, he helped Link repair the damage around the pelvis. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n\nHe spent time with his family before Christmas. He told Levi he wished he had come and Levi promised to come next year with Hanukkah gelt. ''(\"[[Girlfriend in a Coma]]\")''\n\n\nNico worked with Levi to prepare him for a hip replacement. However, the surgery was rescheduled to the mass overdose. Instead, they operated together on a woman who had broken both arms after overdosing and falling. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\n\nNico was working on [[Hunter Martinez]], who had osteosarcoma in his right femur. After three months of chemotherapy, he was ready to have a rotationplasty, to remove the cancerous portion of his leg and flip the lower part of his leg to make his ankle his knee. The surgery was successful and they were hopeful that he'd be able to continue to play baseball. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\n\nNico treated [[Douglas Hall]] in the ER. He had been in a car accident and had a broken clavicle and humerus. ''(\"[[And Dream of Sheep]]\")''\n\n\nNearing the end of his fellowship year, Nico started to look into employment at other hospitals. He specifically scheduled an interview with a hospital in San Francisco. The day of the interview, he operated on [[Josh Sterman]], injecting cement into his spine to stabilize it after a fracture. However, he made a mistake and Josh died. After this, Levi tried to console him, but he brushed Levi off and did his interview anyway. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nNico continued to be cold to Levi, even while Levi tried to be there to support him. Levi ended up backing off when Link advised him that he needed to let Nico process what had happened on his own. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nNico was paged when [[Scott Carter]] fell and broke his coccyx and also ruptured his rectum. While they were operating, Taryn came in to update him on his patients and joked about the broken butt until Nico snapped at her and sent her away. Richard then talked to him about needing to find the humor in humorous patients, though he brushed it off. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Kari Donnelly|Kari Donnelly's]] finger twitched, a sign that the stem cells might have worked, Link asked Nico to keep an eye on her. Nico saw it as a punishment, but Link said he was trying to give Nico the chance to witness a miracle, hoping it would help his attitude - Nico hadn't made progress in processing his mistake and he was rapidly developing a reputation for being unpleasant to work with. Link said he was on the verge of failing his fellowship and this was his chance to save it. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n\nNico was in the ER when he heard [[Soyoung Oh]] speaking Korean. He came over and told Amelia and Link that she was looking for her friend, a Bird. They had him help communicate with her as they treated her for dehydration. They later learned that Bird was actually [[Bertram Hollister]], a fellow patient who had had heart surgery. They had fallen in love in Korea and lost touch. Nico continued to translate for them as they caught up on their lives. ''(\"[[Reunited]]\")''\n\n\nOn Halloween, Nico was supposed to meet up with Levi after he got off work, but Levi got roped into planning the peds Halloween event, so Nico came to the hospital to see him instead. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing to see if she would lose her medical license, Levi forgot his tie, so Nico went to his locker and retrieved his lucky tie, which he put on Levi. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n\nNico, being Levi's only friendly social contact after the hearing, was at the bar having drinks with Levi when a car crashed into the side. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nNico immediately jumped in to help the injured and tried to encourage a panicked Levi to calm down and help as well. When they noticed that [[Blake Simms]] was under some rubble, he helped Jackson remove it so they could free him. He got vodka to sterilize the area so they could stop the bleeding. Then when he heard that the back door was blocked, he attempted to kick it open before Pruitt could tell him that a large vehicle was blocking it. Nico continued to help tend to the patients until the firefighters finally removed the vehicle blocking the back door. Then he helped evacuate those who could walk. ''(\"[[I Know This Bar]]\")''\n\nNico rode to the hospital in an ambulance with Simms. Once he was there, he ended up in surgery with [[Taryn Helm]], helping Link fix her leg. Before they started, Levi collapsed in the OR, so once they were nearly finished, Link offered to let Nico leave to go check on Levi, but Nico insisted on staying, saying Taryn was Levi's best friend and he couldn't help Levi anyway. When Taryn coded as they were finishing, they called in Bailey and Richard to take over. Nico when went to be with Levi, who was told he just needed rest. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Sullivan came into the hospital to see if he was eligible for surgery on his leg, Nico monitored his scans. When Sullivan couldn't stop moving due to the pain, Nico suggested getting a shot for the pain, but Sullivan asked him just to wait and he concentrated on keeping still. ''(\"[[Eulogy]]\")''\n\n\nNico went with Levi to visit his Uncle Saul, who was in hospice care. When Saul died immediately after Levi came out to him, Levi was upset. He then said according to Jewish tradition, he had to stay with the body until someone else arrived to take over. Nico and Levi played card games as they waited. When [[Daniel Schwartz]] arrived, they were surprised to learn that Saul was himself gay and Daniel was his boyfriend. They shared stories and then Daniel helped Levi prepare Saul's body. After this, Levi went home and started packing, telling his mother that it wasn't accepting him if she continued to refuse to let him tell anyone else in the family. ''(\"[[The Last Supper]]\")''\n\n\nNico treated [[Joey Phillips]], who had come into the hospital with a broken clavicle.\n\nLater, when Levi had a patient who was dying of metastatic cancer, Nico helped him turn the cafeteria into a dance floor so his patient and her husband could share a last dance together. After watching them dance, Levi told Nico that he was looking for a dance partner like that. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Link decided to turn down the offer to return to his job with the Mariners, he suggested that Nico apply and offered to recommend him and help him prep for his interview. This excited Nico, who was thrilled with the idea of taking the job. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Ben had the PRT parked at Grey Sloan, Nico peeked in and said it looked cool. Ben said he was welcome any time he wanted to take a shift in it. ''(\"[[No Days Off]]\")''\n\n\nA month into the Covid- pandemic, Nico was still working at Grey Sloan. After finishing a surgery, he came outside to tell the patient's wife, but couldn't find her, so he left the message with Levi, who said he hoped that Nico was doing well, though he himself wasn't. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nWhen Bailey's ankle was hurt when two patients' fathers fought, Nico came and certified that it wasn't broken, just sprained. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")'' He later confirmed with her that it was feeling better. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Dave Oyadomari]] came back into the ER after falling off a stepladder and injuring himself, Nico ended up on the case due to him having a broken collarbone. Due to his being Asian, Mabel quickly realized he'd been misdiagnosed with appendicitis during a prior ER visit and instead had right-sided diverticulitis, which had perforated after he was sent home. Owen allowed Mabel to scrub in due to her catching the correct diagnosis. After Dave's surgery, Mabel went to talk to Owen about how his medical care, which was centered on European norms, had led to Dave being seriously injured, causing him a month off work that would otherwise have been avoided. However, before she could confront him, Nico sent her out of the room, having previously advised her not to risk her residency over it. Instead, he confronted Owen himself. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Andrew had been stabbed following Opal, Levi blamed himself for having seen her in the ER and not stopping her. Nico assured Levi that there was no way he could have known. He also encouraged Levi to get someone to replace him on Andrew's case, knowing he would be too distracted to be a good doctor. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\nAfter Andrew died, Levi confided in Nico that he felt guilty and sad and angry over Andrew's death, but his go-to emotion was guilty. Nico said his was numb, which they recognized was what was wrong with their relationship. Later, they attended Andrew's memorial together and held hands as they watched the video. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nNico treated [[Erika Swift]], a patient who had broken her leg while rollerskating. He put her leg in an bandage and said she'd need a cast for about six weeks while it healed. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\n\nIn April , Nico attended Maggie and Winston's wedding as Levi's date. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nNico helped treated [[Nadia Correa]], who was injured when she flew off the back seat of a tandem bicycle she and her wife were riding after they collided with a priest. She had numbness in her legs, leading them to suspect spinal fractures. They ended up operating on the fractures as well as a tethered spinal cord she'd likely always had. At the end of the day, he attended Teddy and Owen's Wedding at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, [[Myrna Schmitt]] brought Thanksgiving dinner to the hospital for Levi and Nico. She knew they were busy, so she said she'd set up the food and they could come eat whenever they had time. Nico quietly told Levi he didn't technically have to work and could sit with her, but Levi said his mother would never let Nico leave if he did. Despite this, Nico later went and sat with Myrna, who told him stories about Levi as they ate together. When Levi finally made it to the cafeteria, Myrna left and told them both they should visit her. Nico and Levi then had their own Thanksgiving with Jo, Bailey, Richard, and Luna. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\n\nNico scrubbed in on Owen's surgery and helped repair his leg, which was severely broken in a car accident. After that surgery, he learned that Levi had lost a patient and had scrubbed his hands until they bled afterward. He found Levi sitting outside the hospital up against the building and came to sit next to him. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\n\nNico attended the M&M that was held after the death of [[Devon Gomez]]. After Levi spoke, he walked out, over Bailey's objections that the M&M wasn't over. Nico went to Levi's mom's house to see him and reassure him. Levi brushed him off saying he wasn't returning to work and they were over. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nNico treated [[Alice Tom]] after she was attacked at a bus stop for being Asian-American. While he and [[Michelle Lin]] were operating on her, they talked about their experience growing up Asian in the US and feeling like they'd never be American enough. BokHee assured both of them that their faces were American. After her surgery, he punched a hole in the wall of an on-call room. Levi came to check on him and brought him ice for his hand. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the hospital's blood shortage, he helped the residents get the word out on social media that they needed blood, drawing in several donors. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Levi Schmitt]]\nHis romantic relationship with [[Levi Schmitt]]\uabegan when Nico winked at Levi while operating, confusing Levi. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\nLater, at Joe's bar, Nico bought him a beer after a rough day. Levi wanted to pay him back and grabbed his wallet, but Nico touched his hand to stop him and said Levi could buy the next one. Nico then left, with Levi staring after him. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\nNico later came into the residents' locker room to shower despite having access to the fellows' lounge and Levi was shocked and distracted by seeing Nico with no shirt. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\nLater, Nico then asked Levi if he would be willing to get that drink that evening, but Levi said he might have plans later. Nico just said he'd be at Joe's if his thing got canceled. Later, Levi came to the bar for that drink, but Nico mostly brushed him off, confusing Levi. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\nAfter working together on [[J.J. Williams]], Levi and Nico ended up in an elevator together and they kissed. They stopped when someone else got on the elevator, but once they were alone again, Nico apologized for what he'd done. Levi said it was fine and also that it was his first time and he was happy to learn. However, Nico said he didn't want to teach him since he had already dealt with his coming out and didn't want to go through it again. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\nAfter being trapped together in an ambulance during the windstorm, Levi talked about having feelings for men before, but never exploring it because he was a nerd and never considered sex much at all. After his confession, Nico kissed him and the two of them had sex in the ambulance. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")'' They have been in a relationship since.\n\nWhen Levi's mother called while he was hooking up with Nico, Nico was upset when Levi shushed him. Levi tried to explain why his mother didn't know about Nico, but Nico wasn't persuaded and left. Later that day, Levi explained to Nico that his mother likes to talk about everything as if it's going to hurt him and he wants to lock Nico in his own eyes before inviting his mother's criticisms because Nico's his first love. Hearing that Levi loved him, Nico kissed him and they started to walk away. Levi asked if he's not going to say it back. He said he would, but he wanted to make Levi sweat for a minute first. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\nLevi learned that Nico had an upcoming job interview with a hospital in San Francisco, and expressed worry about a long-distance relationship through bringing up sports teams. While together on a case in which Nico had to fill the man's body with cement, Levi continued complaining about Nico's proposed move. Later, it was revealed that Nico made a mistake during the surgery, and the patient collapsed. Bailey ordered Levi to fix the man, as he was the grandson of a friend of hers, but things didn't go well, and the patient died. Later, Nico was about to do a Skype interview with his new prospective boss, and Levi attempted to persuade him to leave and re-schedule the interview. Nico spoke sharply to Levi, saying that he was not a failure, and implied that Levi is, which broke his heart. Levi was angered when Nico started the interview and slammed the door behind him. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nNico was annoyed that he is relegated to simple tasks in the wake of his surgical error. Levi, on a high due to him saving the Seattle Fire Chief, ran to tell Nico about it. However, Nico didn't want to hear it and was rude to Levi, and demanded Levi's help in fixing a shoulder dislocation. Later, Link told Levi to leave Nico alone, and that if he wanted to talk, he should wait for him to say so. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nNico later realized via Link that his past behavior had been unacceptable, in the wake of a fog throughout Seattle, which led to a massive car pile-up on the freeway. He tracked Levi down, only for Levi to give him the cold shoulder, which immediately turned into lecturing on Levi's end when Levi informed him that he missed him. Levi told Nico about his day, and Nico listened, which culminated in Levi informing Nico that he loved him, but he still deserved better than how Nico had treated him. Nico came clean about his anger due to his failure, and that he was jealous of other doctors in the hospital, Levi especially, due to their ability to bond with patients and have successful moments. Levi immediately told Nico that he could help him, and wanted to. Later, the two tearfully watched\ua''My Girl''\uain Levi's basement, and his mother came downstairs with chicken noodle soup. She was very welcoming towards Nico, but called him Levi's \"friend\". Levi immediately informed his mother that Nico was his boyfriend that Nico was the one who had been having a bad day. Mrs. Schmitt then offered up the chicken soup to Nico, after he informed her that he liked it, telling Levi that they would talk later. Nico told Levi that he was \"amazing,\" and Levi put his head on Nico's shoulder. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\nAfter the other residents learned that Levi had been the one to turn Meredith in, they started ignoring him, which upset him. He didn't want to go to work because of it, so Nico promised him a reward after he got through the day. At the end of the day, they were having a drink at Joe's and Nico said he could have his reward after they got some food. However, this was interrupted when a car crashed into the bar. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nNico chafed when Levi started staying with him after moving out of his mother's place while looking for a place of his own. Nico didn't feel they were ready to cohabitate and told Levi that. Later, after seeing [[Irene Sholman]] dance with her husband, Levi told Nico he was looking for his dance partner. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship was further strained when Nico didn't want Levi to meet his parents, even though they were in town. Levi said he could take the criticism, but Nico admitted he'd never told his parents he was gay, despite having told Levi he didn't want to live in Levi's shame spiral. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship continued to struggle, with them only having sex and not talking about the situation they were in. Levi expressed his desire to have a relationship that was more than just sex, but Nico blew up at him, saying that he didn't want to talk about his feelings and he didn't understand why Levi couldn't just accept that. He said if Levi wasn't okay with that, they should end things. Levi said no, he could be okay with it and they proceeded to have sex. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\nLater, when Link decided to recommend Nico for the job with the Mariners, which Link himself was turning down, Levi decided it was time to end things between them, as Levi felt he was always the one making sacrifices for their relationship. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\nAfter the start of the pandemic, Nico went to Levi. He apologized for not being a good boyfriend, but offered to provide Levi with help de-stressing, starting right away in the supply closet. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nNico's arrangement with Levi developed to the point where they had essentially resumed their relationship, to the point where the pair were comfortable joking about their history. After some weeks, Levi finally told Nico he was upset that Nico was unwilling to give any space in his apartment to Levi, even a drawer. In response, Nico told Levi he loved him and asked him to move in. In a complete reverse of their feelings months earlier, Levi made an excuse to leave the conversation without answering. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter this conversation, Levi avoided Nico for several weeks. Nico confronted Levi, asking if they were breaking up, if he wanted to see other people. Levi said he didn't. After the doctor who administered his vaccine for the vaccine trial flirted with him, Levi went to Nico's place, where he learned that Nico had been lighting candles every night in the hopes that one of those nights, Levi would show up. He confessed his love to Levi and they kissed. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nAfter Levi did two laparascopic cholecystectomies in one day, he and Nico had sex in a supply closet. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nLevi ended things between them after losing a patient in surgery, also telling Nico that he wasn't going back to work. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\nWhen Levi returned to work, the two of them had an awkward moment in an elevator. At the end of the day, Nico reminded Levi that Levi had told him to go. Levi said he had had a rough time and the difference between the two of them was that when Nico was having his own rough time, Levi kept coming back. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\nAfter treating [[Alice Tom]], an Asian-American woman who'd been attacked by a racist, Nico punched a hole in the wall of an on-call room. Levi checked on him and then brought him ice for his hand. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\nHe spent Christmas with his family. He describes them as very critical of him, which is why he's never come out to them. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\n\nAs part of his training, he works closely together with department head [[Atticus Lincoln|Dr. Atticus Lincoln]].\n\n\nNico is an [[attending]] [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Shortly before the COVID- pandemic, with his fellowship ending soon, he was offered an interview to take over Link's old job with the Mariners. He either ended up passing on the job or decided to stay on as an attending at the hospital to help out during the pandemic.\n\n\n*He is the first openly gay male surgeon in the show's history. Although Levi was introduced earlier, he didn't realize he was gay until after Nico came on to him. \n*He is also the first orthopedic surgery fellow in the show. [[Callie Torres|Dr. Callie Torres]] followed a specific orthopedic surgery residency, eliminating the need for a fellowship, and all other known orthopedic surgeons were introduced as attendings. The only exception was [[Eliza Minnick|Dr. Eliza Minnick]] as  she trained as a [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] and followed-up with an orthopedic surgical fellowship.\n*As an [[attending]], he wears a personal scrub cap.

Wanting to improve her odds of survival, Jackson took her for debridement in the hyperbaric chamber. He was able to get down to viable tissue, but was shocked when she crashed.

Once his son was discharged, Noah signed an AMA form and left the hospital with his son. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nOwen did some research into the burn pits that caused Noah's condition and found no good research, only anecdotes. He continuously tried to contact Noah to talk to him about it more, but got no response, so he went to Noah's house to appeal to him directly. Noah agreed to tell Owen everything he knew. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nNoah and Owen attended a meeting for veterans, led by [[Roy Davis]], who was collecting stories to appeal directly to the government to get them to acknowledge the connection between the burn pits and the many soldiers getting sick. Roy was surprised to see Noah there, as Noah had always previously refused to attend. Owen started to explain the study he was developing when Roy coughed up blood and collapsed, so they called an ambulance to take him to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Since he was already dying, they knew any treatment would only be about prolonging his life. He decided to have the surgery anyway, hoping to get enough time to lobby congress. He survived the surgery, but coded in his room afterward and died. When Owen told Noah Roy had died, Noah became upset with Owen and said he was done helping him with his study. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nNoah returned to the hospital when he passed out while bagging groceries at his job. When his wife brought Danny to the hospital with her, Noah asked Owen to take Danny and distract him, which Owen did. An x-ray in the ER show a pneumothorax, so they put in a chest tube and gave him steroids and a breathing treatment. After the chest tube was placed, Noah asked Owen how much longer it would be before it was over, because the bills were still piling up and he was tired. Owen said it would be soon. Then he helped Noah get dressed and the family left the hospital together. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\nNoah passed away shortly before Christmas, using medication Owen Hunt had provided for him. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")'' Before he took the medication, Noah assured Owen that his wife knew his plan and that he was at peace with his decision, saying he could care for his son better from the other side. Desperate to help other soldiers, after Owen provided him the medication, he made Owen promise to give the same medication to other soldiers when they needed it, including those who didn't live in a state where physician-assisted suicide is legal. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe was married to [[Heather Young]].\n\n\nHe and his wife have a son, Danny. When he learned he was dying of pulmonary fibrosis, he was desperate to spend as much time as he could with his son.\n\n\nHe was very close with [[Roy Davis]], whom he met when he was just a recruit.\n\n\nHe was in the US military. During his service, he did two tours in Afghanistan, one in Jordan, one in Djibouti, and two in Iraq. After leaving the military, he worked at a seafood plant, but lost that job because his pulmonary fibrosis made him too weak to do the work.\n\nHe later got a job bagging groceries to help pay the bills that were piling up.

The CT showed that the tumor was back, meaning she needed to have awake brain surgery so they could monitor her function as they worked. While in surgery, she was able to sing, her passion, but wasn't able to speak normally when the edge of the tumor was stimulated, meaning she'd lose her ability to speak if they operated. They told Peg\uaabout this and she challenged them to go back to their research and find another option, because Kimmie faced everything with a smile and they should do better for her. They had an idea to use frequency waves to treat shatter her tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue, but while they developed the technology, she had to have more radiation and chemotherapy to treat the cancer. Even though she knew she'd be bald by fall with chemotherapy and radiation, she kept a smile on her face, despite wanting to be able to audition for a musical and beat out Susie Oppenheimer. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nThe doctors continued their research to look for a cure for Kimmie as she continued to deteriorate. Despite her failing health, Kimmie didn't lose hope and still happily sang in her hospital room with Alex and debated the best musicals with [[Tom Koracick]]. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\nWhile undergoing chemotherapy, Kimmie had trouble keeping any food down, so they wanted to place an NG tube. Kimmie didn't want that, so she asked for medical marijuana in the form of oil instead. She said it had been Peg's idea. Alex got the paperwork filled out to get the use approved, but when he went to Peg about it, she was against it, because both Kimmie's parents had been addicted. She fired Alex and decided she wanted to move Kimmie to another hospital for treatment. However, Alex went to her personally and explained to her the benefits of using medical marijuana over conventional medicine. She agreed and Kimmie was given the oil, which greatly helped her nausea.

After treating [[Noah Brosniak|Noah]] with the laser treatment, Tom and Amelia decided Kimmie couldn't wait for it to be honed to work for her type of tumor and decided to develop a treatment plan that would allow her to live until summer, when Tom would take her and Peg to New York and see as many Broadway shows as they could before she died. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\nAfter Kimmie tired of waiting for a cure, she decided she wanted to go to New York and sing in the street on Broadway and live the rest of her life outside the hospital.

After completing medical school, he was matched to Grey Sloan Memorial. On his first day, Koracick assigned him to scut despite his experience practicing medicine.\n\nHe was later tested for COVID, along with the rest of the hospital staff. At the end of the day, Reza, along with Sara and Alma Ortiz, was taken into the OR by Richard Webber, who modified his traditional intern speech to fit the pandemic, promising them to teach them as much as they could and assuring them they'd get through it together. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nWhile assisting Jo while she operated on [[Val Ashton]], Reza used his surgical skill to anticipate her moves. He explained how he came to the US to escape religious persecution and bombings and felt having to repeat his training was a small price to pay. He cheerfully followed Jo's orders, explaining to her that his mother taught him that every day above ground was a good day. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nHe continued working with Jo on Val's case as Val's condition worsened. Finally, two days after Val's surgery, she had to go on liver dialysis when her remaining liver began failing. Later, she coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Levi found himself unable to work on Andrew's surgery for fear of being too distracted to be a good doctor, he asked Reza to step in for him. Reza assisted Teddy as she worked on Andrew's heart. They were able to repair the damage and Andrew was stable and awake in the ICU afterward. However, Andrew coded again later that night and had to be taken back into surgery. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to save Andrew and Reza called time of death. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n\nReza worked on the case of [[Arthur Beaton]], a toddler who was born with multiple ventricular septal defects. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, she cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, Reza was able to get his first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total,  patients were treated using this method. Reza assisted Levi with two of them, as Levi finished the first one earlier than anticipated and another patient had come in through the ER. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nAround Christmas, Reza scrubbed in with Winston for [[Farouk Shami Hunt|Farouk Hunt's]] heart transplant. They awaited the arrival of the donor heart, unaware that the car transporting it had been involved in a serious accident. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nThe heart arrived despite the accident and Winston examined it and found it to be bruised, likely from the crash. Despite this, the transplant went forward and Farouk survived the surgery. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe learned a sense of optimism from his mother, who said that every day above ground is a good day.

She wasn't surprised when they got the news that the liver had been redirected. However, Bailey then found out a patient who was a donor had suffered cardiac death only five minutes prior and was a match for Roberta. Desperate to save the liver, Bailey immediately started compressions and called for a reperfusion machine. They removed the liver from the donor and hooked it up to the machine and were able to restore function, giving them a healthy liver to transplant into Roberta. They called UNOS, who said it wasn't up to them. They then called the Organ Procurement Center, who said they'd get back to them. However, Alex said to shut it down.

When she was faced with deportation to El Salvador, she moved to Switzerland to work at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]].\n\n\n\nSam was born in El Salvador. A war broke out and her father was shot on their front porch, after which her mother took Sam and her sister out of the country. They moved to Florida and her mother worked  jobs  hours a day to keep them safe. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\nSam came to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for an interview to be considered for an internship. In her interview, she said she'd read all about the fire and [[Stephanie Edwards]] was her hero. She didn't realize they'd already done the remodel of the hospital. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nSam attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. In the hallway, Sam was shocked to see Andrew and learn that he worked there. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a roller coaster derailed at a fair, Sam came to Ben because she needed supplies for a burn patient in the clinic. He had Andrew show her where central supply was, not knowing their history. They ended up having sex in the skills lab and were caught by Bailey and Webber. He later came into the on-call room where she was resting and despite them agreeing that they were bad for each other, they had sex again. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the heart monitors started malfunctioning in the ER, Sam stepped in to defibrillate, not knowing the patient was simply sleeping. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nSuffering from a lack of sleep, Sam then started to cause patients to panic in the ER. Richard told Andrew to stay with her and supervise her. Andrew ended up telling her not to talk to anymore patients until she got some sleep. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nAfter overhearing Amelia ask Andrew to figure out which of the new interns had written a paper on pupillary response in comatose patients, Sam told Amelia it was her and was invited to join her team, along with Andrew. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nSam and Andrew both continued working on Team Shepherd, torturing both of them, as they had agreed they shouldn't have sex anymore. Despite this, they tortured each other as they worked, each of them turning the other on. They did this while they worked on a proposal for a surgical innovation to save [[Kimmie Park]]. Their proposal, under Alex and Amelia, was submitted for consideration for the surgical contest, but was not selected. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nDespite not getting the funding, they continued to work hard to figure out a way to save Kimmie. Amelia brought in [[Tom Koracick]] to help them and they tested over and over again, but had no success. Koracick wanted to give up trying to find a solution in time for Kimmie, but during a fight, he had an epiphany and they tried another method, which had greater success. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\nThey use the guided laser treatment on Noah and it worked, but also showed them they didn't have enough time to hone the procedure to work for Kimmie. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Andrew was concussed in the ER, Sam worried about him. When Amelia caught wind of this, she encouraged Sam to tell Andrew she was in love with him. Sam went to Andrew, but Andrew stopped her and said they were young before, but now they're not and they confessed their mutual love. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\n\nWhen ICE agent [[Martin Fields]] came to the hospital looking for Sam, they hid her in an OR and worked on a plan to keep her from being deported back to El Salvador, where she had never been since her family left. They toyed with having her flee, but fleeing would make her a criminal and not let her practice medicine ever again, so they dismissed that chance. Pressed for time, Meredith contacted [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] and got Sam a job at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] working for her and gave Sam all the documentation she needed to show that she had plans to leave the country, including an essay she'd written as part of her application to work there. Then she got a cab from the hospital to the airport. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nShe and Andrew had a relationship in the past. Realizing they weren't good for one another, things ended badly. As she refused to answer his calls, he kidnapped her dog and she then broke into his apartment to retrieve it. He then moved across the country without saying goodbye to her, leading to her blocking him on social media. They hadn't seen each since then until they bumped into one another at Grey Sloan Memorial, where Sam had just started her residency.\n\nHe initially ignored her because they always wreck each other and because he thought she followed him to Seattle, but she made it clear it was pure coincidence. After ending up in the same on-call room, they ignored the toxicity of their relationship and ended up having sex, something they continued to do every chance they got.\n\nAfter Andrew was injured in the ER, he and Sam confessed their love to each other and agreed to start again. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nWhen she learned that Andrew was living in an on-call room, she asked him to come live with her.

Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs.

While working on her, Sara learned that Black patients are subjected to a multiplier when their kidney function is assessed based on assumptions about Black bodies, which made Rashida ineligible for a transplant while a white patient with the same numbers would be eligible. When her last access port failed, Winston insisted that she be placed on the transplant list. Finally, when Rashida woke up, he and Sara were able to tell her she was on the list.

When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip.

However, before they could operate, he needed a blood transfusion as he was anemic. They got him blood, but he rejected it because it wasn't the right type. They re-typed his blood and showed AB, but with no Rh antigen, a very rare occurrence. Before he could have surgery, they needed to find blood donors who were an exact match to his blood so he wouldn't reject it.

Scott went to clean them up, but slipped and fell, breaking his coccyx. He was taken into surgery. While he was there, Gus had a heart attack because of the lack of blood in his body and his organs started to fail, so he was taken to the hyperbaric chamber in order to buy him enough time to wait for the transfusion.

Shayne tried to stop the car, but didn't have time and they drove up the ramp into the back of the truck. Karissa had only minor lacerations, but Shayne was crushed between the steering wheel and the car. When station  arrived at the scene, Andy climbed in the back of their car to check on them and put collars on their necks. Then she started two IVs in Shayne to stabilize him as much as possible while they waited for USAR to arrive.\n\nWhile they waited, Karissa started panicking about being trapped in the car and begged them to save her first because she had people who cared about her and needed her, unlike Shayne, who only had her. Soon after, they cut through the side of the truck and pulled Shayne out that way. They got him onto a stretcher, put a temporary binding on his pelvis, and sent him to the hospital. Then they got Karissa out and put her in a separate aid car to the hospital. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, Shayne and Karissa were taken to separate rooms to be treated. An x-ray showed an open-book pelvic fracture, so they placed a binder on his pelvis and then took him to CT to check for additional abdominal injuries and then to surgery, where they repaired his pelvis. After surgery, he was told he'd need some rehab, but he'd recover completely. He then asked to speak to Karissa. He asked her for an annulment, saying he'd ignored her self-absorption and now knew she wouldn't change and he didn't find it cute anymore. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Karissa Skolaski]]. He says he knew early on that she was the love of his life. They got married during the [[COVID- Pandemic]] after isolating together to ensure regular sex. However, after they were in an accident, Karissa begged to be saved first, despite him being more seriously injured, saying that she had people who cared about her and he didn't have anyone but her. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")'' After hearing these remarks, Shayne asked her for an annulment.

Four years later, he was undergoing chemoradiation to treat mets in his lungs. His wife found him struggling to breathe in the nursery trying to assemble a crib. They admitted him and ordered a CT, which showed a mass in his ileum that was obstruction his bowel, likely the cause of his pain. Jo operated with the hope of resecting the tumor and reducing his pain, which would buy him more time, as his wife was  weeks pregnant and he was desperate to live long enough to meet his son. However, when they opened, Jo found that the tumor was too invasive, so instead of removing the tumor, she performed an ileostomy to make him more comfortable and buy him a little more time. After his surgery, Jo told Kristen that he had a month at most to live. Kristen asked them to do a c-section immediately so he could meet his son, but Jo said it wasn't safe because she was too early. Link said he'd check with [[Carina DeLuca]], giving Kristen hope, but Carina also said no. Kristen then went to Simon and told him he needed to live to meet his son. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, he started chemotherapy treatments to try to buy him enough time to meet his child. While he was getting treatment, he and Kristen did puzzles to pass the time. [[Catherine Fox]] got her treatments at the same time as his and they talked as well. When Kristen began having contractions and needed to go upstairs to be examined, Catherine sent Richard up with her so she wouldn't have to go alone since Simon couldn't go with her. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\nSimon continued receiving supportive care as Kristen's pregnancy continued into the final weeks. When he struggled to breathe, he asked them not to intubate him, fearing the tube would never come out, but desperate for Simon to meet their son, Kristen authorized it. A CT showed that his mets had grown and he had new ones. Kristen then made the decision to have the doctors put Simon on ECMO to buy him a little more time, even though they warned her she might later have to decide to turn off the machines. While Simon was being connected to the machines, Link brought her food and assured her she wasn't being selfish trying to get Simon to live long enough to meet their son. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\nSimon was stable on ECMO when Kristen suffered a placental abruption and had to be rushed into an emergency c-section. While he was in surgery, he learned that Kristen needed the blood that had been brought for him and he said to send it to her so that she and their child would be saved. After their son was delivered, Winston brought him to Simon, who kissed him and told him hello forever before dying.

They were all doing mushrooms and decided to set off some fireworks. They were interrupted by the firefighters of station , who informed them that setting off fireworks in the park was illegal. However, Brad lit another one and it exploded directly in his face, seriously injuring him. All the friends panicked and Tara's ankle was injured in the ensuing chaos. All the friends begged the firefighters to save Brad and then Will, in a misguided attempt to help Brad, climbed into the fire engine and started to drive it out of the park. He drove it into the intersection, where it was t-boned by a delivery van and tipped on its side, trapping Will inside. While some firefighters worked to free Will, others worked on Brad, using a t-shirt to stem the bleeding from his face while they waited for an aid car to arrive. Tara frantically told them they had to save him because she loved him and he'd saved her life by dragging her out of the house after the pandemic, saying she needed to celebrate the fact that she'd lived when so many hadn't.\n\nBecause the accident will caused blocked the intersection and backed up traffic, the aid car was unable to get to the park, forcing them to walk the gurney to the park on foot and then walk Brad back to the hospital. Tara followed them despite having an injured ankle. ''(\"[[Phoenix from the Flame]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, Tara informed the doctors that Brad had been using mushrooms, but begged them to save him anyway. After his surgery, Tara happily hugged [[Michelle Lin]] and thanked her for saving him and was told he'd need additional surgeries. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe's friends with [[Brad DiMarco]], [[Mac]], [[Will]], and [[Bella]].

She is roommates with [[Levi Schmitt]]. After the shutdown, she got a job as a bartender at [[Emerald City Bar]].\n\n\n\nShe had panic attacks as a child. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")'' When she was young, she used to pretend her stuffed animals were sick and would bandage them up. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nTaryn came into [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for an interview to be considered for an internship. When asked about her faults, she said that she hates all of her peers. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\nTaryn attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\nOn Taryn's first day, a roller coaster derailed at a fair. Taryn and Vik tended to [[Dean Parson]], who was injured while pushing kids out of the way. They noticed free fluid in his abdomen and he was taken to surgery, despite Amelia ordering a CT. When Taryn informed Amelia of this, Amelia brought the CT into the OR to do the scan. They found a bleed in his brain and Amelia did a craniotomy. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\nWhen the hospital was hacked, Taryn and the other doctors had to resort to using old school methods to diagnose and treat patients. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nTaryn came to tell Alex their patient had a bleed, but he sent her to find Jo and stay with her. Taryn did so, even going so far as to follow Jo into the bathroom stall. She was later joined by [[Vikram Roy]] until they were dismissed when Alex and Meredith came to stay with Jo. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\nTaryn helped April treat [[Paul Stadler]] when he was initially in the ER and then later informed April that he had died, though she didn't know the details of the case. She also assisted April in delivering [[Ruby Taylor]]. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith had an idea for a surgical project for the contest while operating, she had Taryn pull out her phone and record Meredith explaining everything she wanted to do for the project. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith needed to convince another surgeon who held the patent for the polymer she needed to allow her to use it for her research, she had to wait for a phone call from Madrid. She had Taryn wait for the call, but when it came, Meredith was busy with a patient, so Taryn took the call, angering Dr. Cerone. When they called back, Taryn was told to hand the phone over to [[Andy Herrera]], who was able to convince Dr. Cerone to meet with Meredith when she was in the US. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\nTaryn informed Meredith later that Dr. Cerone was dead, which is why they were stalling. The patent was left under the control of his daughter, [[Marie Cerone]], also a doctor. They later presented the idea to Marie, who was an old friend of Ellis's. When she was reluctant to allow Meredith use without proof that it would work, they showed her the mouse they had secretly treated using her polymer. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nThey continued to try out other polymers to treat various mice. However, the mice kept dying, threatening their success. They kept working despite those setbacks and found that the mouse who had been injected with the cells without a polymer did the best overall, giving them hope for progress. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\nAfter overhearing Maggie, Amelia, and Meredith planning a game night, Levi showed up with Taryn. Maggie just shut the door in their faces. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. Andrew and Bello were fighting in Spanish and Italian, when Helm joined the arguing in French. April also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\nAfter several of the doctors ingested weed cookies, Meredith told the interns they'd have to step up more and told them to keep track of what they did and whoever did the most would win a contest and get to scrub in with her on a Whipple. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\nTaryn assisted Jackson and Meredith on [[Diego Ramirez]] and his tumor resection. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\nAfter April was in a car accident and came to the hospital hypothermic, Taryn and the other interns took shifts with the attendings doing CPR. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Taryn was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. When Taryn got drunk and said she was going to confess her love to Meredith, Carina stopped her, saying love's too precious to waste it on someone who can't love you back. Despite a series of delays, Jo and Alex eventually got married on the ferry, witnessed by their friends. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\nTaryn spent the night monitoring [[Cece Colvin]]. When she crashed, Taryn helped save her. She then continued to monitor Cece as they tested her heart and when Cece noticed that Taryn has a crush on Meredith, she advised Taryn not to waste her time and offered romantic advice. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\nCece later got an infection that made her dialysis catheter no longer available for use, which forced them to find a new way to get access. Meredith later figured out they could use a translumbar catheter. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith showed up to work dressed for her lunch date, Taryn was in awe of her appearance. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] took a personal day last-minute, Webber told Taryn and Schmitt that they were to report to Andrew and remember to provide patients the best level of care. They helped Andrew treat a man with lacerations and Levi had trouble with a cut on his forehead. Levi struggled, so Andrew gave him a pointer. Later, when [[Molly Graham]] stopped breathing, Andrew had to intubate and brushed off the interns' help, which Richard disapproved of. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\nDuring the windstorm, Taryn was excited about the impaled patients. She helped treat [[Phoebe Moss]] and when Phoebe was declared brain dead, she noticed that Phoebe had the same blood type as [[Cece Colvin]]. She contacted UNOS who said because the organs couldn't be transported anywhere due to the storm, they would approve a directed donation to Cece. However, the power went out right as Cece was being taken into surgery. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nTaryn quickly began to panic in the elevator, which increased Bailey own panic. They worked to calm each other down, but were soon calling out for help to come. Jackson and Link came to their aid, trying to open the doors even as [[Jed Lundberg]] tried to stop them. When he learned the organs were for Cece, Jed instead helped. He helped them get free and Taryn and Bailey rushed the organs to the OR. Taryn then assisted with the transplant, but unfortunately, Cece didn't survive the surgery, which greatly upset Taryn. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on the case of [[Uma Paxton]], who was having several internal organs removed to treat a recurrent vaginal tumor. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\nWhen Catherine had surgery to remove her tumor, Taryn was in the crowd watching from the gallery until Richard closed the gallery. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on the case of [[Lucille Reid]]. She believed Lucille, [[Julian]], and [[Marvin]] were a poly couple and seemed pleased to see them. However, it turned out that while she and Marvin were married, she and Julian were just best friends. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\nDuring the opioid overdose, Taryn worked meeting the ambulances outside and triaging patients. She triaged [[Betty Nelson|Betty]] and [[Linus]] when they came in. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\nWhen Alex's mother came to the hospital to see him, Taryn came to tell Alex she was there, calling her Mrs. Karev. Alex, believing that she was talking about Jo, corrected that it's Doctor and told her to say he would meet her at the party. She relayed the message to Helen, who was confused. ''(\"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\")''\n\nWhen one of the lambs from Vincenzo's lab died, he argued with his children over why it happened and what it meant for the research. Taryn came to get Alex so he could see what had happened. ''(\"[[And Dream of Sheep]]\")''\n\nTaryn helped Jackson treat [[Toby Donnelly]], who had been in a snowmobile accident. ''(\"[[Add It Up]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Abby Redding]] needed surgery after being raped, Taryn was among the women who lined the hallway to the elevator to ensure that Abby wouldn't see any men's faces. ''(\"[[Silent All These Years]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on the case of [[Gus Carter]], a child who had a cough a recurrent sinus infection for over two weeks. Due to autism, he wasn't comfortable with a physical exam, so Alex used his love of building and some legos to get him to tell them he was in a lot of pain in his chest. They found a thymoma, but couldn't operate because he was anemic and needed a transfusion first. Then they found out he has an extremely rare blood type with RH null, meaning he needed an exact match to his type. They had only been able to locate four potential donors in the world, but Alex promised they'd keep looking until they found enough to operate. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\nTaryn stepped into [[Scott Carter|Scott Carter's]] surgery to update Nico on his other patients and also asked if she could scrub in on the broken butt. Nico criticized her for making light of a patient's condition and sent her away. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to find her joy again, Bailey set up a skills lab based around the case of [[Wade Foltz]]. She challenged the residents to determine his diagnosis and then practice their surgical skills for the chance to do a portion of the surgery. Taryn participated in the skills lab and won over the other residents. In surgery, she finished her part of the surgery, but when she removed the second clamp, he started bleeding profusely. Taryn immediately panicked and looked to Bailey, who took a step back and Andrew eventually stepped in to finish the surgery. ''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\nWhen an article came out that condemned the healthcare industry, stemming from a list of possible article topics Meredith floated to a publisher, the residents discussed it in the locker room while getting ready for their days. Taryn liked the article and said Meredith was a badass for writing it, but Blake warned them that while he had Hopkins and Koracick on his resum\ue, they might have difficulty finding other jobs. Later, Taryn worked with Teddy on Alicia Chen, who had been hit by a person who fell out of a plane. ''(\"[[It's Raining Men]]\")''\n\nWhen Zola had to have her shunt revised, Taryn was in on the surgery. To her delight, Meredith gave Taryn her number to get updates. Taryn sent updates throughout the surgery and when they were finished, she came out with Tom to tell Meredith how things went. ''(\"[[Breathe Again]]\")''\n\nOn Halloween, Taryn went to the peds department costume parade to watch the children. When Nico came to see Levi, who was unable to leave due to having to plan the event, she commented on their relationship and costumes. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing, Taryn and the other residents were told they'd have to up their game to make up for the missing attendings. At the end of the day, the residents were all exhausted from the extra work they'd done. Blake then announced that Levi had been the one to turn Meredith's fraud in, turning the other residents against him. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\nOn Meredith's first day back at work, Taryn and the other residents greeted her with a cake. Afterward, they went on rounds, where they worked on the case of [[Elliott Calhoun]]. Taryn scrubbed in on his surgery and asked if she should close. However, due to a complication, they ended up having to leave him open and wait.  ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Taryn was at the bar with some other residents, a car crashed through a window and into the bar. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nTaryn's leg was injured in the accident and she also believed she had a broken pelvis. Jackson determined that her leg was broken and set it after giving her a couple shots of whiskey so she could tolerate the pain. She continued to believe she was dying, despite multiple people assuring her she wasn't dying, that she was just drunk. When they finally got the back entrance unblocked, Taryn was put on a gurney and taken out of the bar. ''(\"[[I Know This Bar]]\")''\n\nAfter being removed from the bar, Taryn was taken to the hospital, where they placed an IVC filter and repaired her leg. While Meredith was placing the filter, Taryn, a little intoxicated, confessed her love for Meredith. As Link and Nico were finishing on her leg, she started coding, so Bailey and Richard stepped in to stop some internal bleeding. They had to extend the initial incision into a sternotomy to get proper visualization to find the bleed. They were able to stop her bleeding and she was expected to make a full recovery. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\nTaryn and the other residents were assigned to look into every possible diagnosis for [[Suzanne Britland]]. They gathered in her hospital room and went over every possible explanation for Suzanne's symptoms. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\nAfter she had recovered from her injuries and returned to work, Taryn worked on [[Scott Burke]], who came in after being attacked by a bear. She was confused when she learned that Scott's wife, Rachel, was in love with another man, but kept it secret from Scott at her request. Scott later died of his injuries. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\nTaryn rounded on Ms. Gutierrez with Richard and some other residents. She was meant to scrub in on her surgery, but after she made an off-putting comment about freezing to death being peaceful, Richard chose [[Tess Anderson|Tess Desmond]] to scrub in instead, not knowing she was actually a patient, not a resident. Taryn later scrubbed in on the surgery when the truth came out. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\nTaryn was impressed when Meredith set up a day for  people to get pro bono surgeries. She helped coordinate the patients, but got into trouble when she moved patients at Andrew's word, without Meredith's authorization, an act which she told Andrew was unforgivable. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on Guthrie Hamilton's surgery. When Amelia believed she was in labor during the surgery and had to step back, Taryn congratulated her. Later, when Tom had a moment of panic when Guthrie coded, she asked if she should go page someone to help. Teddy was able to calm Tom down and he was able to finish the surgery. ''(\"[[Sing It Again]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard returned to Seattle after his disastrous presentation, Taryn along with the other residents were challenged to look for things that could explain his symptoms. ''(\"[[Sing It Again]]\")''\n\nShe continued to work as part of the team finding a diagnosis for Richard. When he was diagnosed with cobalt poisoning, his hip replacement was replaced and he was cured. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\nTaryn helped on the case when [[Erin Banks]], whom the hospital previously knew as Cindy Wright, came back to the hospital. She was a human trafficking victim who had developed a hernia. Taryn was shocked to see Bailey let Andrew work on her case. When they learned the truth about her, including her name, Taryn was the one to call the police and inform them of Erin's location. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\n\nEarly in the pandemic, Taryn had a mild case of COVID-. She said she learned to make sourdough during that time. She couldn't taste or smell it, but the texture seemed right to her. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\nTaryn was back to work at the hospital as COVID- cases started to creep up. When a shipment of PPE arrived, expected to contain masks, Taryn and Mabel were assigned to guard the boxes. They were all disappointed when the shipment contained only booties. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Yvonne Boyd]] was mauled by her pet tiger, she was brought to Grey Sloan Memorial. Taryn did an ultrasound of her heart and pronounced her dead on arrival. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\nTaryn worked on the case of [[Manoj Joshi]], a sex therapist with a hand injury. She became fascinated when she learned that he advertised as being able to get his clients up to  orgasms in an hour. While they operated on him, Taryn talked about people needing sex especially during a pandemic. After surgery, when Manoj offered his secret, Taryn eagerly asked him to share it. He said he simply asked what his clients wanted and he listened to them. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Tom Koracick]] demanded a second COVID test, believing the first to be a false positive, Taryn delivered it to his house and took it back for testing after he completed his own swab. She was interested in his statistical model, which he wanted to use to stop the pandemic. When she returned to his house a second time, he told her he'd destroyed the world on the model. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\nTwo days later, Tom was brought to the hospital with neurological symptoms. Taryn noted that he'd been fine when she last saw him. When they got him into the ER, Taryn was kicked out of the room as she was a resident and he had COVID, even though she'd already had it and recovered from it. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nWhen Seattle Pres reached capacity and stopped accepting patients, Grey Sloan Memorial activated surge protocol, which meant residents would start seeing COVID patients. Taryn was part of the operation to set up the cafeteria as COVID overflow. When she placed the monitor in the wrong place, Teddy snapped at her and then sent her away when Richard asked for help moving patients. Later, she found Meredith in another patient's room, having tended to them when they coded. As Meredith went back to her own room, she told Taryn to get her a wheelchair and then she collapsed. Taryn sat by her bedside as Richard made the difficult decision to have her put on a ventilator. ''(\"[[No Time for Despair]]\")''\n\nTaryn was in the ER when she saw that Andrew had been stabbed and needed surgery. She went to share this news with Richard Webber. Later, Andrew died of his wounds. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\nIn the wake of Andrew's death, Richard Webber planned a memorial service for him as they would be unable to have a funeral. Taryn recorded Levi speaking about Andrew to add to a video tribute for Carina, but wouldn't let Levi record hers. Taryn felt extremely guilty. She helped treat [[Byron Gibbis]] for endocarditis and as many of the doctors headed toward Andrew's memorial service, she told Maggie that she had benefitted from Andrew being sick as it meant more surgeries for her and that left her feeling guilty. On top of that, she hadn't touched anyone without gloves since before the pandemic started. Maggie had her turn around and they stood back to back, touching through their clothes. Taryn then attended the memorial with the other doctors. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\nOnce Meredith was off the ventilator, she had another CT because she was unable to stay conscious. Taryn was delighted when the scan showed no obvious problems, but Richard was concerned because she was still too weak to wake up. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\nTaryn helped treat [[Guy Houston]], who was injured in the Seattle protests that followed the death of George Floyd. She was shocked at how much damage a rubber bullet could do and learned that a rubber bullet is a metal bullet encased in rubber. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\nAfter some time treating patients during the pandemic, Taryn began to feel burned out and considered leaving her residency. Levi, seeing her struggling, invited her to move in with him, so she wouldn't be alone so much anymore. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\nJo chafed at Taryn's presence and only let her stay because she was a good cook.\n\nAt work, Taryn bonded with a heart patient named [[Gwendolyn Yates]], talking to her about her dating life and work. When Gwendolyn was discharged, Taryn gave her her number and said to call anytime. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nTaryn enjoyed living with Levi, but Jo was annoyed by their constant presence and decided to leave. \n\nMeanwhile, when Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, she cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, Taryn was able to get her first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nTaryn helped treat [[Father Christopher]], who was injured when [[Emma Correa|Emma]] and [[Nadia Correa]] lost control of their tandem bicycle and ran into him. Despite their best efforts, he died of his injuries. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them  seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total,  patients were treated using this method. At the end of the day, Taryn sat outside a bench thinking through her surgery and what went wrong. Bailey told her that was a good thing as it would prevent her from making the same mistake again and that all great surgeons did it. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nLater, Taryn scrubbed in to assist Levi as he operated on [[Devon Gomez]], who was having an ileostomy reversed. When they reached the point of dissection, Levi had an attending paged, but decided to go ahead and start the next part of the surgery, saying it was routine for him by that point. However, Taryn quickly noticed that Devon was bleeding. She and Levi raced to find the source of the bleeding. Once they'd identified it as coming from the base of the IMA at the aorta, they tried to stop it, but they were unable to and by the time Maggie, Richard, and Bailey arrived in the OR, Devon was dead. Taryn explained what had happened and Bailey forced Levi to call time of death, as it was his patient and his mistake. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhile Levi went to the scrub room to scrub out, Taryn explained to Bailey and Richard what had happened. Later, when Jo told her that Levi needed their help, she helped get him to the ER, where Jo and Jordan bandaged his hands, which he had scrubbed until they bled. ''(\"[[No Time to Die]]\")''\n\nAn M&M was assembled to determine how Devon's death could have been prevented. At the M&M, Taryn weighed in when Levi struggled, filling in details. After the M&M, Taryn was hesitant to treat patients, worried about getting something wrong. Bailey noticed this and acknowledged that Taryn had been through something as well. Taryn explained that as a child, she always knew the right answers, but never raised her hand because she didn't want to be known as a know-it-all and she was getting that same feeling again, even though Levi is her best friend. Bailey reminded her that in that OR, he was her boss in addition to being her best friend. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Levi quit, the other residents were only getting assigned simple procedures, which they considered a form of punishment. When Richard didn't show up for work, they questioned what they were supposed to do. Meredith, who was operating on [[David Hamilton]] that day, went to Hamilton and asked if she could use his surgery as a teaching opportunity and allow all hospital staff to observe. The residents were eager to be part of this. Before the surgery started, Meredith explained what they were doing and gave them time to ask questions. The surgery then proceeded and went well. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Ivan]] came to the hospital entrance with a python wrapped around his body, Bailey sent Taryn to gather the surgeons to come consult on his case. Once she'd gotten them downstairs, she hid inside the hospital doors, because she was afraid of snakes, until Richard sent her to get alcohol to help release the python. She later scrubbed in on Ivan's surgery. ''(\"[[Put the Squeeze On Me]]\")''\n\n\nTaryn was selected from among the residents to scrub in on [[Fernanda Lima]], who had traveled from Boston for a Ross procedure. Taryn told Maggie she was honored to be selected for such a difficult surgery. When they learned that Fernanda's condition had worsened and had to convert to a Ross-Konno procedure, an even more difficult surgery, Taryn was worried about the additional risk, but the surgery went smoothly and Fernanda's family was told she'd be okay. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nWhen Taryn learned that Andy had been assaulted, she brought an evidence collection kit from the hospital so she and Carina could collect the evidence where Andy felt most comfortable. They asked for Andy's consent before starting each step of the exam. Taryn then explained that one vial of blood would go with her back to Grey Sloan for testing while the other went into the kit to be handed over to the police. ''(\"[[When the Party's Over]]\")''\n\n\nTaryn and the other residents were called to do grand rounds with [[Nick Marsh]] and [[Meredith Grey]]. They arrived to find Nick with the patient, Mason Taylor, who was brain dead after being struck by a drunk driver. His wife wanted to donate his organs, but UNOS rejected them, so she donated his body for research. Nick explained that they would be transplanting a genetically modified pig kidney into Mason's body in the hopes that they could perfect the technology, which would eliminate the wait for donor organs. He transplanted the kidney near the groin so they had better blood supply and could see the kidney as they waited to see if it would work. After the surgery, they celebrated that the kidney was producing urine. When the kidney later stopped working, Nick had them do a biopsy and sent the residents away to avoid screaming at them. Then he did everything he could to save the kidney, but started to lose faith. Meredith suggested using epinephrine, which worked and Jordan reported that the kidney was working again. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the Grey Sloan Memorial surgical residency program was put on probation, Taryn worried about the possibility of the program being shut down, which would mean finding a new residency spot. And if they weren't able to find new spots, she worried that they'd have to change specialties. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\nTaryn met [[Simon Clark]] in the ER and presented his case to [[Atticus Lincoln]] and [[Jo Wilson]]. He was a previous patient of Link's, so Link took over his care. Next, she presented the case of [[Margot Talbert]] to [[Maggie Pierce]] and [[Winston Ndugu]]. She had abdominal pain and a pulse in her abdomen. They took her for a CT, which showed an abdominal aortic aneurysm. They took her into surgery, but her aneurysm ruptured before they could start, forcing them to hurry. They were able to repair the damage and she was stable afterward. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\nOn the day [[Jamarah Blake]] was set to return to the hospital to rule on if the program would be allowed to continue, Taryn scrubbed in on [[Cora]], who had a large pancreatic head tumor. Due to the intricacies of the tumor, they decided to do the surgery ex-vivo, removing all of the involved organs, then dissecting out the tumor before replacing the organs. During the surgery, Taryn was responsible for sucking up as much of Cora's blood as possible so that it could be recycled back into her body. The surgery went well until they replaced the organs and began re-attaching them. Taryn noticed some unexpected bleeding and since they had no blood available to transfuse into her, Meredith suggested they stop until more blood arrived. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")'' Taryn went to retrieve the blood, but found that the shipment of blood had been largely destroyed, leaving them with no blood for Cora. This forced them to move Cora to the ICU without completing her surgery. After Cora died, she helped Levi put out the word on social media that they needed blood at the hospital, drawing in several donors. At the end of the day, when the surgical residency program was shut down, she had to pack up her things. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nWith the program shut down, Taryn got a job tending bar at [[Emerald City Bar]]. Six months later, when the program was re-started, Levi came to the bar to beg Taryn to return, but she told him she was making more money as a bartender. ''(\"[[Wasn't Expecting That]]\")''\n\nRichard also tried to get Taryn to come back to work, saying the program needed her, but she still refused. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe has a crush on Meredith Grey. While drunk at Alex and Jo's wedding, she planned to tell Meredith, but\ua[[Carina DeLuca]]\uastopped her, saying love was too precious to be wasted on someone who can't love you back. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\nDespite this advice, Taryn continued to pursue Meredith, who was oblivious to her pursuits. When [[Cece Colvin]] noticed this, she told Taryn that she spent  years falling in love with straight girls and offered to help Taryn not do that. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\nLater, when she was in surgery to place an IVC filter, under the influence of the sedation plus some whiskey, she confessed her to love to Meredith. When she sobered up, she was extremely embarrassed. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\n\n[[Levi Schmitt]]\nShe and Levi are best friends. They lived together at [[Levi and Taryn's Loft]] until he quit his residency and moved back in with his mother. After several weeks, she brought him his mail at his mother's house. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nShe was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] until the residency program was shut down. She found a job bartending, where she said she makes more money with less stress.

She'd previously survived three other types of cancer, starting when she was a child. During her third battle, she was in her third year of medical school. It took a year to recover and it drained her college fund, forcing her to work as a barista. While she was in the hospital, she noticed that there weren't a lot of people there due to the blizzard, so she decided to spend some time in the skills lab, borrowing scrubs and a lab coat to blend in with the residents. While in the skills lab, she struck up a conversation with Richard Webber, who allowed her to practice her skills under his supervision. She then accompanied him and the residents on rounds, where she impressed [[Ava Gutierrez]] by telling her the shelters were open  hours a day and were accepting any animals people brought in to protect them from the cold. Richard decided to let Tess scrub in on Ava's surgery, thinking she was a resident. Just as she prepared to cut, Levi came in and recognized her as his patient. She was then returned to her hospital room, where they got a psych consult for her. She explained how the cancer had deferred her dreams and she just wanted to spend some time in the skills lab pretending her dreams had come true, then Richard invited her to do more and she couldn't resist. Once she was determined not to be a flight risk, they rescheduled her surgery for the following day. Richard then encouraged her to pursue her dreams after she was finished fighting her cancer. He showed her a new tremor in his hand and said his dream was to be a surgeon and now he can't anymore. He then gave her his stethoscope and said he didn't need it anymore and hoped she would.\n\n\nShe works as a barista since her cancer forced her to drop out of medical school.\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, Tess}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

They were both airlifted to the hospital. Toby had a deep soft tissue injury to their shoulder with arterial compromise. Richard did an ultrasound and ordered a CT angio to check for other internal injuries. The CT showed that there was no blood flow to their arm, so they were taken into surgery. The surgery went well and they were stable and away afterward, but Toby was then told their mother would be paralyzed from the neck down due to her own injuries. ''(\"[[Add It Up]]\")''\n\nToby was hopeful when the doctors came to them about a new treatment for Kari, involving stem cells directly injected into her spine. Toby said they were especially aware of their arms and legs because Kari couldn't use hers and they wanted their mother to regain used of her arms if she could. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nThirteen days after her transfusion, Kari still had no movement in her arms and had pneumonia. A CT revealed a lesion on her lung, so they had to remove a portion of her lung. Despite these setbacks, she said she didn't regret it because she was finally living her life in a way that made her happy, which had been inspired by Toby coming out to her. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nShortly after her surgery, Kari's finger twitched. They thought it might just be a spasm, but monitored her just in case. Just when she was about to give up on it, she squeezed Toby's hand. They celebrated and she had even more purposeful movement of her hand and fingers, showing that the stem cells had been a success.

He was [[Chief of Staff|Chief Medical Officer]] of the Foundation before being replaced by [[Richard Webber]]. He was [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], where he trained [[Amelia Shepherd]] in the field. In Seattle, he developed a relationship with [[Teddy Altman]] until she chose Owen after having his baby, though the two later developed a short-lived affair.\n\n\n\nAt some point in his life, Tom got married to Dana and had a son named David with her. When David was  years old, he died when he got hit in the head with a baseball bat.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref> David's death happened two weeks before Halloween, which was David's favorite holiday and Tom and David's thing. They had prepared a Luke Skywalker\uacostume to go trick-or-treating that year. David never got a chance to wear it and the costume hung on the his bedroom door for months as Tom couldn't bring himself to take it down. His son's death left him hating Halloween.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nAfter David's death, Tom went numb and sleep-walked through years of his life. Eventually, he crossed paths with [[Catherine Fox]] and she finally woke him up again and reminded him what it was like to be alive. They performed sacral nerve implantations so often that they came up with a routine of singing \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\". Over time, they ended up having sex though they never were romantically involved beyond that.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nTom was Amelia's mentor at Johns Hopkins Hospital.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nHe met [[Derek Shepherd]] on the conference circuit. Derek was not a fan of Tom's as he told him it was appropriate that his name had \"ass\" smack in the middle of it.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter learning she had a large brain tumor, Amelia called Tom, her former mentor, to come to Seattle to operate on her. After he arrived, he agreed to operate and also made it clear that Amelia wouldn't be allowed to treat patients until he cleared her, as the tumor was affecting her judgment.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref> Amelia's surgery went smoothly and a few days afterward, Koracick cleared Amelia to go home.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Amelia attempted surgery on her first day back, she asked Tom to scrub in, unsure she could handle it herself. He scrubbed in, but she was able to remove the tumor easily without his help. After the surgery, he admitted he'd hoped she'd fail because that would mean she's not better than him anymore. After their shared success, they had sex in an on-call room.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\n\nAmelia called Koracick back to Seattle again to help with researching a technique to remove Kimmie's tumor. After seeing Kimmie and her scans, Koracick believed it was pointless to try to perfect it within such a deadline and wanted to quit, but during a fight with Amelia over the issue, he had an epiphany and discussed a possible solution with Amelia. They later tested it and while it didn't work perfectly, it had more success than their prior attempts, giving them hope.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], x</ref>\n\nTom came to the game night Maggie organized so Amelia and Meredith could meet [[Clive Johnson|Clive]]. He played as April's partner and had a good time. When the night abruptly ended, Tom ended up driving an intoxicated April home.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nAfter waking up from their one-night stand, Tom stuck around at her place and tried to figure out why she was so different from the woman Amelia had chosen for her Power of Attorney during her surgery. He eventually figured out that it was a crisis of faith and talked to her about his own faith, which was tested when his son died in a freak accident involving a baseball bat to the head at age ten. His marriage fell apart after the death of their son and his priest recommended talking to God. Since he didn't want to talk to God, he decided to go to Mass and speak to his son instead, something he told April he still does.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nAfter [[Noah Brosniak]] was diagnosed with an HH tumor, Tom and Amelia decided to use the treatment they were developing for Kimmie to help him. They had to control the lasers very carefully to make sure they were destroying the tumor but not his brain. The procedure was successful and Noah lived, but the difficulty made them realize it would take more time than Kimmie had left to fine-tune it to work for her type of tumor. Therefore, they decided to develop a treatment plan that would allow Kimmie to live until summer when Koracick planned to take vacation time and fly Peg and Kimmie to New York to see as many Broadway shows as possible before she died. Alex became angry when he learned of this plan and shoved Tom up against a cabinet before backing off.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs Tom and Amelia continued their research into using the laser treatments to remove tumors, he spent time in Seattle more frequently. After Meredith turned down his flirtations, Tom caught a first glimpse of Teddy when he witnessed an awkward interaction between her, Amelia, and Owen on the elevator. While working on their research, Amelia began listing reasons for her to be appointed interim Chief over Teddy. Tom picked up on the jealousy shining through in her comments on Teddy's history with Owen and pointed out Amelia didn't need to pretend like she was a victim in her marriage to Owen. She had been an ass to Owen and the sex she had with Tom the day after they separated screamed that she was glad to be rid of Owen. With their research failing spectacularly, Tom took the time to give Amelia some advice. He told her to knock the other player, Teddy, out of the game if she wanted Owen back. Amelia refused to take personal life advice from him. Tom then shared his biggest regret in life was not fighting for his wife when she decided to walk out of their marriage into the bed of another man.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nAs Amelia was pulled into surgeries often, Tom often worked on the project by himself out of boredom. When Link mistook Tom for the new interim Chief, Tom helped him find Alex. Tom then witnessed how Alex swiftly approved Link's request for a new -D printer to make prosthetics without asking for any details. Tom sarcastically commented Alex was very chiefly while he previously thought Bailey had only picked Alex to make herself look better. Over their research, Tom proposed more sex to Amelia, who turned him down as she had turned a new page with Owen. Tom went to the ER to find Alex to get him to approve a requisition before he would be fired. He then took over when [[Vikram Roy|Vik's]] patient with a nosebleed deteriorated quickly due to Vik's incompetence. Tom rushed the patient to the IR suite to embolize the artery and called in Alex for help, but they failed to get vascular access in time and the patient died on the table. Alex dismissed Roy but Tom wanted him to call time of death first. Roy stated this mistake couldn't be put on him as he was an intern and left. Tom then told Alex he was failing at his job.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom and Meredith were both summoned to Los Angeles for a VIP patient. They speculated that it was someone famous. Before their private plane took off, Meredith told him about how she had dabbled in neurosurgery and how that had come to an end. Tom noticed how uncomfortable Meredith was on the plane and she requested he keep talking to keep her distracted. Catherine met the two of them at the new Catherine Fox Medical Center. On their way to the radiology suite, Catherine told them the patient was a -year-old female with crescendo neck and back pain. She showed them the scans and they were in awe of a tumor that had invaded the vascular and nerve domains, which they agreed could not be removed easily. Catherine then revealed that she was the patient. Tom apologized for his bluntness. The tumor required a biopsy and Catherine stated she would not inform Richard or Jackson until they got those results back. She then took them to the IR suite right away. As he performed the biopsy, Tom ordered a worried Meredith not to backseat drive the procedure. Tom told her that she was a Big Gun, like him, spending her days with worst-case scenarios. He told her Big Guns don't worry until there is something to worry about.\n\nAs Catherine started to wake up after the procedure, Tom started singing \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\" to her. He informed her they were still waiting on the results. Meredith wanted to call Richard but Catherine wanted to get a drink first. As they entered the bar and ordered tequila, Catherine asked the two of them to talk her through the next steps if the tumor turned out to be malignant. They tried to dance around the subject but Catherine pointed out that nothing they could say could be worse than what she had been imagining since finding out about the tumor. Tom and Meredith then said there were two options, osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma, with a chondrosarcoma being likely to render her quadriplegic. Tom excused himself to the restroom and returned with the news that the results were in. Catherine requested one last drink before heading back to the hospital. After finding out, Tom and Meredith attended the hospital's ribbon cutting. When Tom commented on Catherine's looks, Meredith asked what was going on between them. He then shared how Catherine had saved him after his son's death. He confided that he was now worried about his friend, who had a grade  chondrosarcoma that he had no idea how to remove without paralyzing her. Catherine came over and told Tom to find away because after surviving her parents' deaths and raising her siblings and building this legacy for herself, she might just survive this tumor, too. Catherine went to call Richard, who didn't answer his phone as he had been arrested.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref> Richard called her back after Meredith bailed him out, but Tom answered her phone. Richard hung up, believing that Catherine was having an affair with him.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nTom returned to Seattle after the windstorm and recruited Amelia's help to figure out a surgical plane for Catherine's tumor. Their plans were disrupted when Owen came to explain to Amelia that he and Teddy had just been fighting as friends, while Amelia stated fighting like that is what couples do. Tom then requested Owen leave so they could focus. Once he was gone, Tom once again expressed interest in Teddy. After a failed VR practice run of multiple approaches, Amelia was paged away for a consult. When she returned, they started arguing over the impossibility of the situation, which attracted Jo to their study room. She shared that there was a brand new way of -D tumor visualisation called ORBEYE. As Jo dug into the case, Tom marvelled over her beauty and miraculous solution. At the end of the day, Tom met Teddy in the attendings' lounge and sat down to eat his fries. He estimated she was about  weeks along, which was spot on. They introduced themselves to one another and Tom fed her fries as she was rubbing her feet.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nWith better visualisation available, Tom and Amelia came up with a plan to remove the tumor. As the day of the surgery drew nearer, they spend every waking moment studying the tumor and preparing. On the morning of the surgery, Teddy came across Tom playing Operations on a bench outside. Teddy was confident that he and Amelia were ready. Tom and Amelia came to Catherine to explain to her and her family their approach. Amelia interfered when Tom's smug demeanor rubbed Jackson the wrong way. On their way to the OR, Amelia and Tom went over the plan again. Tom had to admit he was nervous when even his arrogance was off. He admitted was thinking about how he couldn't lose another person dear to him and how countless men would be left with sexless lives if this surgery were to leave Catherine unable to operate. They then did the superhero pose and entered the OR to meet Catherine. She reminded them to get clear margins and preserve her motor function. Tom and Amelia gave her a private moment with her husband. Jackson then put on \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" and the staff all danced to the song together.\n\nThe first part of the surgery went well, with Tom loudly singing along to the music. The new microscope gave them perfect visualisation. When they came to the part of removing the tumor en bloc, Amelia found that she couldn't get it free. Tom then told her to do a suck and pluck but they found the tumor was too dense. Tom had the music killed and said they needed to go in from the front. Amelia was in disbelief that Tom wanted to flip Catherine with her spine open but she realized they had no other choice. The flip went well but Tom froze as he was now directly facing Catherine's face. Amelia then feigned a problem so they had to switch places, which brought him back. They freed the tumor from the brachial plexus but the electrophysiologist warned them that the signal in one of her arms was lost. Since removing the tumor en bloc was no longer an option, Richard told them to remove the tumor piecemeal and use his PathPen to see if they got it all. They chose to follow that approach. After hours of doing so with still tumor left behind, they were warned that continuing would impair the motor function in her arms. They decided to stop operating and leave some of the tumor behind. Catherine woke up after the surgery with her motor and sensory functions intact. Tom and Amelia then shared that they had to leave some of the tumor behind. Tom and Amelia apologized for that but Catherine was glad to still be alive with no impairment. Tom said she would have to have scans every three months to track the tumor's growth, but Catherine added she could just live her life in between those scans. She thanked her surgeons for giving her her life back. She planned on throwing a party to celebrate this miracle. Afterward, Tom ran into Teddy in the lobby. She congratulated him and noticed that he wasn't in a celebratory mood for not having succeeded at removing the entire tumor. Teddy stressed that he did save her life and her career and invited him to Joe's to buy him a drink. He asked for a rain check because he wanted to smell good when she would spend money on him. She agreed to that and he walked away with a smile.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom was called in to consult on the case of [[Lucille Reid]], who had an aneurysm in her brain. He and Teddy operated together to fix her. They also observed that she had two men doting over her: her husband, [[Marvin]], and her best friend, [[Julian]]. After working on the case, Tom wondered about the analogous situation happening with her and Owen. That night, she went to his hotel room to show him that she was only ever meant to be friends with Owen.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom attended Catherine's party, with Teddy as his guest. At the party, he and Owen butted heads over his relationship with Teddy, which included a planned pre-baby vacation to Palm Springs. Owen confronted him about it, but he was unconcerned until Owen said that he's not a father. When he heard that, Tom punched Owen. Teddy corrected Owen that Tom is a father and stopped Owen from punching Tom back. Tom then iced his hand as the party continued until a plastic pan accidentally placed in the oven forced an evacuation of the building.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Owen left a birthing class Teddy had invited Tom to be with Teddy after she experienced some troubling symptoms, Tom realized Owen was trying to shut him out of the experience. He warned Owen that he would fight for Teddy to have the person who loves her and only her.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Teddy decided she wanted to buy a house before the baby was born, Tom helped her look, as he claimed superpowers relating to houses.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter [[Kari Donnelly]] was paralyzed in an accident, Link found a study that involved directly injecting stem cells into the spines of quadriplegic patients in the hopes of regaining the use of their arms. He suggested this treatment for Kari, who agreed to try it. In surgery, Tom injected the stem cells.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nThirteen days after her infusion, Kari still had no mobility in her upper limbs. She had other health issues associated with her paralysis, which weakened her.\n\n\nWith only three weeks left until she was due, Teddy had not purchased a house for them to live in. Tom took up the mantle and found Teddy a house that fulfilled all the requirements she'd set out. He then surprised her with a set of keys, which he admitted were just a prop because he hadn't been able to go pick up the actual house keys.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nTom later purchased a crib for Teddy's baby and said he'd put it together for her.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy went into labor, Tom remained unaware and continued to assemble the baby furniture at her new house. While working, he Skyped in to see [[Kari Donnelly]] move her fingers.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe tried calling Teddy, but she didn't answer. He then figured she had given birth and went to the hospital. He found her in a room with her newborn daughter and a crying [[Leo Hunt]]. He admired the baby for a moment and took Leo off her hands. He knew Teddy had gotten back together with Owen after he rode in on a white horse and made all the right promises. Teddy took all the blame for her decision and told Tom he was wonderful. Tom knew that and stated it wouldn't last and that she'd come to regret her decision. He told her he would be there for her when it ended because he loved her, and in the meantime, they would remain friends. He then brought Leo back to daycare so she could rest. A week later, Tom had a meeting with Catherine and accepted her offer to become Chief Medical Officer of her Foundation, meaning he would get to oversee all Chiefs of Surgery of her Foundation's medical centers.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nTom arranged to permanently move to [[Seattle]] and he asked his prot\ueg\ue resident [[Blake Simms]] to move with him. Blake refused as he couldn't leave his grandmother behind. However, Tom wanted him so badly that he paid for Blake's grandmother to move to Seattle with them.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nOn his first day at the job, Tom enjoyed taunting Owen before revealing his promotion to him to put him in an awkward position. He made Owen let him step off the elevator first. While rounding the hospital, he found out Bailey had set up a skills lab for the residents and dismissed teaching, ignoring Jackson's remark that Grey Sloan was a teaching hospital. In the ER, he found that Owen and Maggie were working excessively to resuscitate [[Reid Kim]]. He ordered them to stop but Owen ignored him. Before he could shock Reid's heart again, the rhythm returned suddenly. Owen punted to put the already-charged paddles aside but accidentally shocked Tom in the crotch. Tom fell the floor while squirming in pain. His prot\ueg\ue resident [[Blake Simms]] helped him to a wheelchair and got him [[Catherine Fox]] to treat him. Owen briefly apologized while rushing the patient to the OR but he dropped by Tom's room for a proper apology afterwards. However, in the meanwhile, Tom had obtained an emergency restraining order against him for acute emotional and physical distress. Owen was baffled. Tom directed him to his lawyer for any questions and made him leave.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref> Tom had fun in abusing the restraining order to exert power over Owen by making him leave his trauma room while he examined Owen's patient. Later, he made Owen leave the ER altogether.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith released an expos\ue that trashed Grey Sloan's reputation, Tom quickly came up with a plan to get the hospital free positive publicity. He called [[Dana Martin|Dana]] and [[Peter Martin]] to inform them that [[Jackson Avery]] would operate on [[Clervie Martin|their daughter's]] deformed skull pro bono if they allowed them to film the surgery and use it for promotion. The parents consented since the surgery would otherwise require them to take out a second mortgage. Tom hired a camera crew to document Jackson's miraculous work. Jackson hated the set-up, which only increased as Tom was more concerned with getting proper testimonies as publicity material than putting the parents' concerns at ease. After Tom asked the father to repeat his testimony while filmed from another angle with less backlight, Jackson cut in and told him that the surgery was hard enough on the parents already. Tom reminded him that he was the boss and wondered if he should get Catherine to explain it to him again. However, Jackson went behind his back to have the surgery take place without being documented and had him replaced by Amelia. Tom found out and went to confront him in the OR, where Jackson told him he would call security if the camera crew came near the OR. Tom wanted to pull rank again but Jackson pointed out that he was Foundation, too, owning more shares of the hospital than anyone else, and that his cosmetic procedures provided quite an income for the hospital, so Tom better leave him alone. Tom tried to reason that fires like the one Meredith had started spread rapidly and that it would burn down more than this hospital alone but Jackson didn't budge. Tom realized that they needed good doctors to stay and went to inform Owen that he had gotten rid of the restraining order, but he came too late, as Owen had taken a job at Pac-North. Tom thought he would come to regret that and invited him to call him when that happened. He also reminded Teddy she could still call him if she regretted her choice of picking Owen over him.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nTom put Andrew on his service to get him to make Meredith make things right with the hospital. Meredith herself then turned up with a sick Zola. They did some scans and found that her shunt needed to be revised. Tom flawlessly performed the surgery.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Tom worked on a patient with Teddy and Bailey. While he dismissed Halloween every chance he got, Teddy was stressing out over Owen's apparent hint for her to make costumes for their children. She said they skipped so many steps from friends to a family of four that she didn't feel prepared for the situation, leaving her to feel like she had no idea what she was doing. Tom then said he didn't understand her either and told her not to let Owen make her feel inept as a mother for not making costumes like his mother had done. He finished up his part of the surgery and went back to the ER to save more Halloween casualties. The patient made it through the surgery. Afterwards, Bailey confronted Tom with his incessant complaining about the holiday and he told her that his son's death ruined Halloween for him as it used to be their thing. Hearing the story made a hormonal Bailey sob in front of him, which she had been trying to avoid, and he comforted her.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nTom stayed at the hospital while most of the attendings took the day off to support Meredith on the day of her hearing before the medical commission. He was surprised to find Amelia, Link, and Teddy back soon and learned that they had diagnosed [[Paul Castello]], the man who had killed Derek, with a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. Tom performed a craniotomy and managed to evacuate the hematoma against all odds. However, a sudden rebleed happened and Tom was unable to save Paul.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Tom learned that Teddy was scrubbing in with Maggie on a cardiothoracic surgery after months, he came into the gallery to observe her and complimented her technique. After the patient's heart wouldn't restart, Maggie quit because she had lost faith in her abilities. Tom tried to convince her otherwise but she had made up her mind. Tom then asked Teddy to become his Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery again. She got mad thinking he fired Maggie to give Teddy what she wanted. She told him that she loved Owen and had moved on from Tom. She said he would make some woman or several women very happy but she asked him to stop barking up this particular tree. Tom then said Maggie actually quit and he wanted her to replace her. Tom then pointed out that Owen had a baby with her and hadn't even proposed yet while Tom was ready to marry her today, which made him wonder if she really wanted to close the door on him.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nTom sprung into action when his prot\ueg\ue [[Blake Simms]] sustained a mid-facial fracture when a car crashed into Joe's bar. He insisted on checking the scans for brain bleeds himself and found none. He then checked if Jackson was good to operate after the long night he'd had. Jackson said he didn't need a babysitter and went ahead with the surgery. Tom requested an update on every step. Jackson couldn't help but make a snide remark about using this case to exploit Blake's vulnerability for free publicity. They neglected to provide him with updates so Tom came in furious when they were wrapping up the surgery. Owen then stopped Jackson as he saw a sign of a CSF leak. Tom scrubbed in and found and patched up the leak. Tom called Blake's grandmother and while Jackson showed her to her grandson, Tom thanked Owen for catching the CSF leak and they shook hands. At the end of the day, Tom watched in disdain as Teddy and Owen announced their engagement to the hospital staff.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nBailey took some unexpected personal time off while the injured residents were still out, increasing Tom's workload. On her first day back, he commented on her unexpected leave multiple times. At the end of the day, she told it wasn't just a vacation but instead time to grieve her miscarriage. He sympathized with her, having been through two miscarriages with Dana before they had David. He shared that it is not as easy to get over as people make it seem, as a miscarriage takes away a piece of your heart that can never be replaced. That is why he developed a habit of lighting a candle on the babies' would-be birthdays. Bailey took his advice and found comfort lighting a candle in the chapel.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie met with Tom to ask her for her job back but he was hesitant as he had Teddy already to replace her.<ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref> As Catherine purchased and subsequently closed down Pac-North, she had Tom interview the staff to see who could be transferred to Grey Sloan. Bailey wanted to make some recommendations but Tom refused to hear her out. Tom went to the waiting room and started with Richard. Tom immediately told him that Catherine had already secured his position at Grey Sloan, which angered Richard and made him refuse. He also met with Maggie despite Catherine already having re-hired her, too, just to make sure it wouldn't seem like he was playing favorites. However, he stressed that it was still Teddy's department. Owen grew impatient when Tom started interviewing residents after meeting all the other attendings. When Owen suggested he was playing a game, Tom promised him he would be out in time for his wedding and continued to interview the residents. When he had seen everyone but Owen, Tom took his time consulting with Catherine on the phone. At the end of the day, he found Bailey, Jackson, Richard, Meredith, and Owen waiting for him in the conference room. They told him they were prepared to quit unless he agreed to all of their terms, which he could present to Catherine as his own ideas to save face and ensure that Catherine wouldn't fire him for causing her top doctors to quit. He was forced agree to re-hire Owen and to have the Cardio and Peds departments led by Co-heads.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nAs a blizzard hit Seattle, Teddy learned that Amelia was on leave and asked Tom about it, but he didn't know why, only that it was not about her baby. Later, Tom brought Teddy hot cocoa as she was enjoying the snow out in the ambulance bay. She told him that she was trying to quiet her mind as she had been having this fear for months that Owen was the father of Amelia's baby. She admitted she was afraid that Owen would always be in love with Amelia. Tom assured Teddy that Owen was very much in love with her, even though he would like for it to be different. Teddy told him he was a good man. He opened up and said people didn't seem to like him despite his attempts to get in with people. Teddy told him she didn't dislike him at all. Tom then initiated a snowball fight. That night, Teddy came by his hotel room. As soon as he opened the door, she started kissing him. He let her in and closed the door.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOn his way to VIP patient [[Griffin Ford]], a multimillionaire who was behind a rocket explosion over the city causing severe injuries, Tom overheard Owen and Teddy discussing wedding venues. Tom was surprisingly nice to Owen. Teddy was afraid it would make Owen suspicious. Tom wanted to keep seeing her and discuss what it meant but Teddy said it meant nothing and that she had acted impulsively because she was afraid that Owen could be the father to Amelia's baby. Tom then went to see Griffin, who talked about the bad press the explosion had left him with. He pleaded with Tom to do a thorough examination in order to find a medical reason that could have caused him to make the mistake that led to the crash. Tom recruited Meredith, who was annoyed that Tom had cleared an entire floor for Griffin, causing troubles with admissions in the hospital. She started her exam but left it to Jackson so she could care for her own patient. Jackson couldn't find anything. Griffin then offered Tom a bribe, asking for a fake diagnosis in exchange for a large sum of money that would allow him to do good in the world. Tom consulted with Meredith about what she would do with Griffin's money and how she decided which rules to break. She gave him some ideas and said she just followed her gut in order to improve the world. Tom then decided to accept Griffin's bribe and \"diagnosed\" him with an aneurysm that could have influenced his judgment. At the end of the day, Teddy came to see Tom in his office and apologized to him, saying he deserved better than what she had done. She explained Tom made her feel good and like she was in control. She didn't want to hurt him because he was such a good guy. They then kissed again.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith organized a pro bono surgery day with  surgeries scheduled. Tom increased the pressure by only allowing OR access until  PM. During the day, Teddy pulled him into a supply closet and told him that Owen was not the father to Amelia's baby. However, that didn't change the way that Teddy felt about Tom. She was paged away and Tom went to check on the pro bono surgeries. He found several patients and their loved ones yelling at Meredith for increased waiting times. Tom then agreed to give her more time and pay for the overtime as well. He confessed Griffin Ford gave him some money and Meredith immediately figured out what he had done. He reminded her that she told him to follow his gut to fix the world. Afterward, Tom met up with Teddy in the OR gallery and told her that while he had slept with a lot of women, he drew the line at married women because he had been the guy whose wife had slept with another man. He wanted to make it easy for Teddy so he told her to go home to Owen and spend time with him.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nTom was part of the team of physicians trying to find out what was happening to Richard. Teddy caught up with him at work and he casually suggested she not marry Owen. He then suddenly froze as they were approached by [[Dana Hamilton]] and her son, [[Guthrie Hamilton]], who bore an uncanny resemblance to Tom and Dana's son David. Dana explained that Guthrie had a brain tumor with a spinal met and she didn't know who else to go to. Tom had Guthrie admitted and ordered new scans. Noticing how it made Tom upset, Teddy paged Amelia and informed her about the situation so she could take the case. As Amelia went to introduce herself, Tom used his busy schedule as an excuse. Owen paged Tom for a consult on [[Vera Kitano]], who kept on singing after waking up from her surgery. Tom diagnosed musicophilia and went to check out her scans. Teddy found him in the scan room and an emotional Tom told her that he always thought he could have saved David if he had gotten him to the hospital in time, but now it was like David was there and he couldn't even stand to be in the same room as him, meaning that thought he had been holding onto was a lie. Shortly after beginning the operation, Amelia started to experience contractions. She had Tom paged to take over. He desperately asked her to work through it but she was confident he could do it. Teddy calmed him from the gallery, making him focused enough to diagnose an air embolism. They got it out and Tom finished the surgery successfully. He delivered the happy news to Dana, who apologized for having put him through this. Teddy came by his office to comfort him and apologized for the pain she had caused him. He told her she had taken away more pain than she had caused him. They briefly held hands until she pulled away and left.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nTom and Amelia agreed that Richard was suffering from Alzheimer's, which convinced Catherine to take him home. Later, Owen came to yell at Tom for ignoring his request for time off for the wedding. Tom said he had ignored the e-mail because he didn't think it was urgent based on the subject line, though Owen informed him that they had moved up the wedding to tonight. Tom was surprised but approved Owen's time off. Once he left, Tom called out Teddy for not warning him. He feigned happiness for her. When new symptoms arose, Amelia and Tom performed an EMG, which proved peripheral nerve damage, thus disqualifying the Alzheimer's diagnosis. Tom ran into Teddy again and he brought up the wedding, which he thought she was rushing to convince herself that she could live without Tom. Teddy insisted the wedding would happen, which Tom doubted. Tom then went to see Catherine, who told him she might be asking him to take on a bigger role in the Foundation as she wanted to devote more time to Richard as she was determined not to give up on him a second time. This inspired Tom to page Teddy to his office. He told her not to throw her life away and reminded her that she loved him, too. He insisted he wouldn't give up on her and said he would be waiting for her in his car at  PM, ready to take her wherever she wanted to go. As she started kissing him again, she said she couldn't do that but admitted she loved Tom, too. They proceeded to have sex, during which Teddy told Tom that this was goodbye as she was still going to marry Owen. Unbeknownst to them, they were recorded on a voice mail that Teddy was accidentally leaving Owen.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nThe affair effectively ended while word about the butt dial accident spread around the hospital.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle, Bailey sprung into action to prepare the hospital for the incoming patients while Tom maintained his casual, laid-back attitude. He nonchalantly walked around the hospital with a nine-iron golf club to keep people at a distance when necessary and refused to keep Bailey informed on the order of PPE he had placed. Eventually, the delivery arrived. Tom was joined by a handful of excited doctors, amongst them Teddy, at the loading dock to unpack and distribute the box. However, they soon found that all of the boxes contained booties while there were no masks or other protective gear. Frustated by his mistake, Tom started hitting the boxes with his golf club and broke down on the spot.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nTom heard that Richard made up a system using a UV light cleaning robot to clean masks and other PPE. Afraid of facing Catherine's wrath over his mistake, he tried to convince Richard to let him take the credit for Richard's idea, which Richard refused. He hid from her throughout the day but she paged him and Richard to the conference room at the end of the day. She told Tom that the crisis had proved bigger than him and she would accept his resignation at Chief of Chiefs, in return offering him a position as neurosurgery attending. His ego bruised, Tom claimed he could find a job anywhere he wanted, though Catherine pointed out that word of his sexual escapades had gotten around. He then accepted her proposition.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nRichard replaced him as Chief Medical Officer. Tom joined Owen and Jackson in the lounge as they were watching his speech announcing mandatory COVID tests for all hospital staff. He joked Richard was doing better than his last on screen performance, to which Owen reacted by throwing him out of the room. Richard helped Owen set up drive-through testing, which Tom had been putting off for weeks. Richard tasked Tom with introducing the new interns to the hospital's workings during the pandemic, but he only handed out assignments and told them to find someone else for questions. Due to his lacking guidance, [[James Chee]] failed to finish progress notes in time so Tom had to help him out. Later, while waiting in line for his COVID test, Tom overheard Owen instructing [[Mabel Tseng]] to show [[Sara Ortiz]] how to properly put on her PPE, which Owen said \"someone else\" should have shown her earlier. Tom took the hint. After clashing over a patient discharge with [[Alma Ortiz]], who told him half of her class had quit, Tom went to Richard's office. Citing the disasters with the interns quitting or failing at their jobs, he told Richard he wasn't a natural teacher like him. As he prepared to go home, Teddy joined him in the lounge and asked him to let her buy him coffee to apologize for the lack of contact between them these last few months. He asked her to leave him alone so he could get over her, because she had broken him and he had had enough hurt for a lifetime. To make matters worse, Owen came in to inform Tom that his COVID test had come back positive, meaning he had to go straight home and quarantine for  days.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nFrom home and still asymptomatic, Tom virtually attended an attendings' meeting. As he demanded a new test, Jackson flipped over the tablet to shut him out. Taryn delivered the test to his house. Not allowing residents in his home, he had her wait outside while he did the test on himself. Through the window, she noticed he had created an algorithm predicting the global spread of COVID- by adapting the algorithm for a zombie apocalypse game. The test came back positive. He demanded another one but his request was denied. His mood had taken a turn for the worst since his simulation had shown they would all die within a year. In the evening, Teddy showed up with soup to cheer him up, but he ignored her as he sat on the floor sweating and shaking, finally symptomatic and forced to face the reality of his diagnosis.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Tom is admitted to Grey Sloan.]]\nAs his symptoms rapidly worsened, he was taken to the hospital, where he seized upon arrival. He was in a postictal confused state as Teddy started the work-up in the ER. Amelia consulted on the case, coming out of her maternity leave. The exam showed no neurological deficits and she guessed the confusion had to be attributed to hypoxemia or possible early sepsis. She later did another EEG to exclude another seizure while his numbers remained stable. Teddy remained in the room afterward and said she hoped he had been too sick to answer the door, because that meant that there was hope for them, that their relationship or friendship could be salvaged despite the hurt she had caused him. She said they couldn't go through it alone and if he wanted her gone, he had to wake up and tell her to leave. He then opened his eyes and told her he had in fact ignored her. Glad to see him awake again, she jokingly told him she hated him. He stated they both knew that wasn't true and then asked for a sponge bath.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], x</ref>\n\nHis condition improved though he suffered mentally from having people die around him. The confrontation with his mortality had made him nicer to the point where he talked to Maggie without using diminishing nicknames. He told her he had put his hopes on beating the virus himself on Meredith pulling through, so he was delighted to hear that Meredith was awake, too. He got some rest but woke up to Maggie failing to resuscitate his roommate. Tom got emotional and asked for the man's full name so he could properly pray for his family, whom he had heard during the numerous video calls. To cheer him up, Maggie informed him that Meredith was still stable. Tom then bribed a nurse to wheel him to Meredith's room. Inside, he told her he wanted to see that it was possible to beat this thing. As he said he wanted to be in a room where no one was dying, he broke down. She reached out and held his hand. As they had a friendly conversation, another patient down the hall died. Tom opened up and told Meredith that all he had in life was work and a long list of women he had slept with. She told him she had more. As they talked about kids, a nurse discovered Tom in the room and took him back to his own room while judging him for breaking protocol.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after, a somber Teddy came to inform him that Meredith's health had declined and they intubated her. She came to tell him in person because she wanted to be with someone who didn't hate her. Tom said he didn't hate her but he wanted her to hear from her sometime soon that she never loved him. She went back to work without doing so, but returned after operating on [[Andrew DeLuca]]. She commented that Tom's oxygen saturation had gone up, a good sign. She then told she did love him. She tried not to because she also loved Owen. She thought she could love them both but ended up tearing everything down to the ground. Tom pointed out that empirical evidence showed that she did not love them both, even though she may have convinced herself otherwise. He said he was still there while Owen did not want her anymore. If she actually loved him, they would be together and she wouldn't be so miserable. He needed for her to admit that so he could get up off the ground where she dropped him, if he were to survive COVID-. She then tearfully admitted she never loved him. He thanked her for giving him what he needed.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref>\n\nWith his health spectacularly improving, he attended Andrew's memorial service and was  discharged not long after.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref> He returned to work soon and hovered around the COVID ICU to keep an eye on Meredith. He heard about the ventilator shortage in the hospital and warned Owen, who had taken over Meredith's from Teddy, not to take her off the ventilator too soon or else she might not have one available if her sats were to decline again. Owen made it clear he was aware of that. Tom later overheard how the ventilator shortage forced the hospital to close its doors for trauma. Owen found Tom hovering outside Meredith's room and told him they would soon take her off the vent as she was consistently breathing over it. Tom said he would hate it if someone like him got to survive and someone like Meredith wouldn't make it. All too familiar with survivor's guilt from Iraq, Owen softened up and said that that feeling he was something he wouldn't wish on anyone, not even Tom.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\nHis first case back was [[Karissa Skolaski]], who had been in a car accident and had asked the first responder to save her first rather than her husband. Tom took her for a head CT, which showed no lesions that her selfish outburst could be blamed on. He had her admitted overnight for observation.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith failed to wake up with no plausible cause, Teddy took her for a head CT. Tom showed up in the CT boot as they waited for the results. A worried Teddy rambled on about the serious long-term effects. She then remembered that was a reality Tom was facing and apologized for her inconsiderately bringing it up. He brushed it off and said she was merely stating facts. Tom consulted on [[Felix Pelgado]], a patient of Link's that Amelia had brought in. Amelia took the case and as she operated on the meningioma, Tom and Link watched her from the gallery. Tom said he enjoyed watching Amelia's elegance and focus. Link brought up Meredith. Tom stated he had decided to avoid the entire COVID wing. They both wanted to scream at God for the miserable reality they had to live through.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\nTom puts up a tough exterior at work and he is not shy from praising his own skills, both of which contribute to other people generally disliking him. However, Tom is funny and actually an emotional person as confirmed by [[Lorraine Simms]]. As such, he knows when to let go of his tough facade and show his true colors to people who are in need of comfort, like when he helped [[April Kepner]] acknowledge her crisis of faith or when [[Miranda Bailey]] needed some comfort after suffering a miscarriage. The loss of his son David rendered him with a notable soft spot for children as evidenced by his excellent bedside manner with [[Kimmie Park]] and the lengths he went to to make her final weeks perfect for her.\n\n\n\n[[Dana Hamilton]]\nHe was previously married to Dana. They had two miscarriages before their son David was born. Unfortunately, David died at the age of  due to a baseball accident. Tom and Dana's marriage fell apart and they divorced after their son David\uadied.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\uaTom mentioned to Teddy once that he knew what it was like to be cheated on, making it likely that Dana cheated on him as their marriage unraveled.\n\n [[Amelia Shepherd]] \nAfter Amelia's first surgery when she had recovered from her tumor, she had sex with him, where he also admitted she was a better surgeon than him.\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nHe had sex with April after they met at Maggie's game night. The morning after, he helped her with her crisis of faith and shared how he dealt with his son's death.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nicole Herman]]\nHe and Nicole had sex after she became blind.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nAfter learning that Teddy was pregnant with Owen's baby, but they weren't a couple, Tom expressed interest. When he later found Teddy in a lounge massaging her feet, he offered her some of his fries and fed them to her because her hands were covered in feet.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he operated on Catherine, Teddy offered to celebrate with a drink, but he took a rain check, saying he needed a shower.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Tom and Teddy at Catherine's party.]]At Jo and Alex's New Year's Eve party, Tom and Teddy shared a kiss at midnight. Later, he saw her lying down because her feet were hurting and said she should go get a mani-pedi at his favorite place. They ended up getting mani-pedis together, which they both enjoyed.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nTheir relationship hit a small snag when Tom wondered about her relationship with Owen. However, she allayed his fears and he invited her into his hotel room to have dinner.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Teddy was working on the difficult case of [[Elizabeth Hall]], Tom was back at Hopkins. However, he came back and saw her being comforted by Owen.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nLater after having a snowball fight and hot cocoa, she came to his hotel room and they kissed and he shut the door.\n\n\nHis son David died at the age of ten when he was hit in the head with a baseball bat.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref> Tom always felt incredibly guilty over his death, always assuming he could have saved his son had they gotten to the hospital in time.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nAfter operating on Catherine, he went to the chapel to talk to his son and tell him his dad did well.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Catherine Fox]]\nHe has a history with [[Catherine Fox]]. They flirted a little bit when they ran into each other again at the hospital and she invited him to return for lectures in the future.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n\nTom later told Meredith that Catherine was the one who woke him back up after his son died, reminding him that he was still alive and shouldn't sleepwalk through his life.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAs her mentor, Amelia has professional respect for him, though she acknowledges and loathes his arrogance. He likes to take credit for her surgical skills. After her tumor was removed, he stayed to cover her service until she was cleared to return. However, she stopped him from leaving and asked him to join her on her first case back as she needed some hand-holding.\n\nAfter they operated together, he had sex with her after he told her she was a better surgeon than him. He later claimed he only said that to get her to sleep with him, though she didn't buy that. She also told him she dislikes him intensely.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], x</ref>\n\nWhile they worked on their research together, Tom gave Amelia advice on how to get where she wanted to be with Owen.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\n\nDr. Koracick was the [[Attending#Department Head|head]] [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. He trained [[Amelia Shepherd]]. He helped to cover her service at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] while they planned to remove her tumor and stayed to do so until she was cleared to return to work. He later partnered with her on her innovation project regarding ultrasound ablation of inoperable gliomas and gained privileges at Grey Sloan to jump in and help out when necessary.\n\nCatherine appointed Tom Chief Medical Officer at the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]], meaning he was the Chief to all the Chiefs of Surgery at the Catherine Fox Medical Centers, [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] included. He then presumably quit his position at Johns Hopkins to spend his time at Grey Sloan, the best hospital of the Foundation. After he messed up a critical order of PPE during the COVID- pandemic, Catherine fired him and offered him an [[attending]] [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] position, which he accepted.\n\nAfter that, [[Richard Webber]], the new Chief Medical Officer, gave him his [[Resident#Program Director|Director of the Residency Program]] position at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\n*He plays music and sings along while operating.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], x</ref>\n*His Grey Sloan Memorial lab coat has Tom Koracick embroidered on it, while the lab coats usually display the\uadoctors' full first names.\n*He grew up Catholic.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n*He likes to play Operation before surgery to get himself in the mood.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxThomasKoracick.png\nxThomasKoracick.png\nxThomasKoracick.png\nxThomasKoracick.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThe following episodes are Tom-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life:\n*[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\n*[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\n*[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\n*[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]]\n*[[Sing It Again]]\n\n\n\n\n{{Tom Koracick Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Tom Koracick]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Koracick, Tom}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She was the youngest of five siblings, but was always the mother when they played.\n\nWhen she grew up, she married Jonathan and they immediately tried to have children. She had her first miscarriage six months into their marriage and had one per year until they finally got to the second trimester. Then she had a placental abruption and had to have an emergency hysterectomy and the fetus did not survive. Jonathan was then diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma and died, but before he died, he froze his sperm, giving Tovah the hope that she'd eventually bring his child into the world and realize her dream of being a mother.\n\nOver two years later, Tovah was prepared to have a uterine transplant to aid her journey to motherhood. Since she had family in Seattle to help her during her recovery, Addison asked to do her surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial. As Addison operated, the HVAC system at the hospital went out, forcing her to call in Meredith to rush the surgery. After the placed the graft, there was no blood flow, forcing them to detach it to dislodge a clot. Despite this complication, the surgery was a success and Tovah was stable after her surgery. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her transplant surgery, Tovah began having seizures. Addison administered lorazepam and phenobarbital to treat the seizures with no effect. In order to preserve brain function, Addison put her into an induced coma in order to consult with a neurosurgeon for further treatment options. After her CT and labs were evaluated, Amelia ordered an MRI, an EEG, and additional panel-testing to determine her electrolyte and immunosuppressant levels. Because the testing revealed no neurological causes for the seizures, Amelia recommended an increase of anticonvulsants and switching immunosuppressants to combat the likely cause of neurotoxicity from the anti-rejection medication due to the uterine transplant. Addison agreed, and the new treatment plan proved successful. She woke up with the uterine transplant intact and still qualifying for Addison's trial. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nSeveral months later, Tovah was pregnant in her transplanted uterus. The pregnancy was her final embryo made from her husband's sperm. When she was eleven weeks, she reported abdominal pain, so Addison came to Seattle to check on her. Addison found that she had restricted blood flow to both sides of the uterus. An MR angio showed the right side was completely clotted off while the left side was clotted, but salvageable, so they took her into surgery to clear the blockage and try to save the graft and the pregnancy. In surgery, they discovered there was no blood flow to the left side. Addison prepared to remove the graft and pregnancy, but Meredith suggested a vascular revision to restore blood flow. It worked, but by that point, there was not fetal heartbeat. Addison did a D&C. When Addison told Tovah what had happened, she also told her the graft was still viable and she could try again, just not with her husband's sperm. Levi, seeing her grief, offered to recite the mourner's Kaddish with her. She cried as they did so. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe was married to Jonathan until his death. They were both one of five children.\n\n\nShe is the youngest of five siblings. Her family lives in Seattle. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")'' Her sisters begged her not to participate in Addison's trial because they didn't want to lose her.

She had surgery to repair the fractures, but when she woke up afterward, she believed everyone else was singing when they weren't and believed she was talking when she was actually singing all her words. They got a neuro consult and she had an MRI, which showed no signs of a stroke or bleed. They decided to keep her overnight to monitor her and see if it was a side-effect of the anesthesia. Later that day, she developed a tension pneumothorax. They were able to relieve the pressure and she stabilized, but Herschel realized he just wanted her to be safe and sung to her that he loved her.\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Herschel Kitano]].\n\n\nShe is a professor at the University of Washington like her husband.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kitano, Vera}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Veronica had a mild case, but her mother quickly ended up in the hospital with difficulty breathing. Marcella's condition declined, so they called her daughter to see what she wanted them to do, as Marcella had no healthcare directive, but learned Veronica was also at the hospital, as her own breathing had worsened. Veronica begged the doctors to focus on saving her mother while Marcella said to focus on saving her daughter. Soon after, both of them were in the position to need ventilators, but only one was available. As Veronica had the better chance of survival, she was put on the ventilator while Marcella was bagged.

During his interview, he said that he had to keep his phone on him in case he got a call from [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], his first choice. However, when they sent him a rejection during the interview, he quickly changed his mind and sung the praises of Grey Sloan Memorial and Seattle. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n\nVik attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a roller coaster derailed at a fair, Vik and Taryn tended to [[Dean Parson]], who was injured while pushing kids out of the way. They noticed free fluid in his abdomen and he was taken to surgery, despite Amelia ordering a CT. When Taryn informed Amelia of this, Amelia brought the CT into the OR to do the scan. They found a bleed in his brain and Amelia did a craniotomy. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Vik came into the OR to replace Taryn, he was instead sent out to find her and Jo. He did so and stayed with them until Alex and Meredith arrived and told them they could leave. ''(\"[[---]]\")''\n\n\nVik worked on David Roman, who came into the ER after trying to cut off his hand because he believed he was sinning by masturbating often. Vik made a couple jokes at his expense. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\n\nVik decided to sneak into the presentations for the surgical contest. While he was there, he took a cookie from Arizona's tin before Bailey discovered he was there and pulled him out. Despite this, he later lied and said he hadn't had any of the cookies in order to enter a contest to get to scrub in on a Whipple. He later went to a patient who needed a central line and started to freak out due to the weed. He ended up backing into a cart and falling, which caused him to get stabbed in the arm with a scalpel. When Richard learned Vik had lied about the cookie, he fired Vik for endangering a patient. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Vik got fired for endangering patients while high, he hired his brother, [[Sanjay Roy|Sanjay]] to represent him as he sued Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital for wrongful termination. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\nVik agreed to drop the suit and return to work if he got paid for the weeks he missed plus a formal apology from Bailey. Bailey initially resisted, but at a subsequent meeting, Bailey told him he was lucky to have the experience of learning from the doctors at Grey Sloan. She agreed to hire him back with a one-year probationary period. If he didn't screw that up, she'd make him an amazing surgeon. He accepted the apology. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")''\n\n\nAfter his return, as promised, he had to stay by Bailey's side. When [[Matthew Taylor]] came in after a car accident, he helped operate on him to remove his spleen. When he learned that April was also in a car accident and it wasn't looking good, he was upset because he said he liked April. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Lila (All of Me)|Lila's]] mother collapsed at her wedding, Vik met them at the ER to help treat her. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Barry Clemens]] came into the ER with abdominal pain, Vik ended up on the case. When an x-ray showed a large object in Barry's rectum, Vik bet that it was a shampoo bottle. He was also surprised to learn that it didn't mean that Barry was gay as the male pleasure spot is inside the rectum. Later, in Barry's surgery, Vik spotted a bleeder. Despite being told by Richard to wait, Vik cauterized it, which caused the bottle of hair spray to bounce around the OR, injuring Vik and was possibly the reason Barry died in surgery. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Alex was named interim chief, Vik had to follow him around. Vik helped clear the ER of family and the police. When [[Tad]] came in with a nosebleed, Vik parked him in a bed and said he'd come back to pack it. When he returned five hours later, Tad was still bleeding and coughed up blood. Tom stepped up and helped him treat Tad, but it was too late and Tad died. When Koracick told Vik to call time of death since Tad was his patient, Vik refused and left the room saying that he was just an intern and Tad's death wasn't on him. Alex came to the locker room later and fired Vik, citing his lie about having taken care of Tad and his inability to take responsibility for his neglience. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nAfter April had a day with several cases that made her question God and her faith, she went to the bar, where Vik came to sit next to her. The two ended up leaving together. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\nThey continued to sleep together, but with no contact during daylight. Despite this, he fell asleep at her place more than once. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nHe took advantage of their relationship to get better opportunities at work. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\n\nHe was a surgical intern at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] until he got fired because he attempted to treat patients while high. He was hired back when he hired his lawyer brother to represent him in a wrongful termination lawsuit, although he was to work under Bailey's close supervision. However, he was fired again by Chief [[Alex Karev]] when he neglected a patient with a nosebleed for hours, resulting in the patient's death.\n\n\n*He was credited as Eshan in his first episode, but the actor revealed the character's name to be Vikram Roy on his Twitter page.

Winston did so and Wendell and his friend climbed into the car and told Winston to drive away quickly. Not long after that, Winston was pulled over and there was stolen merchandise in the car. He was arrested and his brother and his friend suffered no consequences. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\n\nWendell came to Grey Sloan and roped [[Karen (Season )|Nurse Karen]] into helping him trick his brother, [[Winston Ndugu|Winston]], by posing as a patient with aortic dissection and then pretending to be dead. Then the two of them, plus Maggie, went to get coffee together. Wendell apologized for missing their wedding, saying he had a job go south and couldn't even afford the bus ticket to Seattle. But he had a new job as a medical sales representative. While Wendell and Maggie went to tend their patients, Wendell went to [[Owen Hunt]], who was acting as chief for the day, and pitched the products he was trying to sell. This upset Winston, who quickly realized that Wendell had used their relationship to land the job and came to Seattle to pitch to the doctors more than to see Winston. Despite this, Winston was able to reconcile his feelings and told Wendell he would introduce Wendell to some of the other doctors. He also told Wendell that while he still believed their mother wouldn't have died if she hadn't had to deal with Wendell and their father, he was trying to get past that. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nWendell did a presentation on the medical device he was attempting to sell, saying it was applied like a patch onto the patient's body and would give a continuous ECG, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, allowing doctors to monitor their patients from anywhere. Maggie said she wanted to test the device, so Wendell gave her some. However, the device didn't work. He took it back and said they got the prototype model and he offered a replacement. Winston noticed that the replacement was identical to them first one and Wendell admitted that he had lied. He was desperate to sell the devices because he had taken out a loan from a loan shark to buy them. He told Winston he either needed to help sell them or pay back the loan. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\n\nWinston put Wendell up in a hotel to get him off his and Maggie's couch. He claimed he was waiting to hear about a job in Boston. On the night of Meredith's party, Wendell showed up expecting to join the party. Winston sent him away, even after he said that his lenders were after him. Wendell sat outside the house for a while before leaving. Eventually, Maggie gave Wendell the money he'd asked for and so did Winston, with each of them unaware that the other had done it. ''(\"[[Stronger Than Hate]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe has a tense relationship with his brother, Winston. This stems from their mother's illness and death, as Winston believed their mother focused too much of her time and money on Wendell and their father, which led to her death. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")'' His father was physically abusive to both of them. ''(\"[[I'll Cover You]]\")''\n\n\nHe claimed to be a medical sales representative for Trinity Labs, but in actuality, he'd merely purchased $, worth of their product in the hopes of selling it all for a profit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Wendell Ndugu Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Wendell Ndugu]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ndugu, Wendell}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He is married to [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], whom he trained under in Boston before she moved to Seattle.\n\n\n\nWinston worked under Maggie while he was a resident at Tufts. He had a crush on her from the first day of residency even though she was his chief. The fact that she was younger than him only made him crush harder. He bided his time, but she moved to Seattle in mid-, right before he became an attending, so he never got a chance to ask her out.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nSix years later, for the third time in his life, Winston attended the Surgical Innovation Conference in Los Angeles. He spotted Maggie from across the room during heart valve happy hour and approached her. He admitted he had looked for her at earlier editions of the conference and was glad to have finally seen her there. He then told her about his crush, observed she wasn't wearing a wedding ring, and said he hoped he would finally be able take his shot and ask her out. They soon gave in to their mutual attraction and retreated to her room, where they had sex.\n[[File:x-.jpg|Winston and Maggie reconnect.|thumb]]\nAfterward, they had a walk by the hotel pool. With only  more hours left for the conference, they set out to get to know each other better. They did a lightning round. She described her perfect day to him, which sounded much like a romantic comedy. She then clarified she wanted to spend that day alone because she liked being alone, to a certain degree. He then started to describe his perfect day off, which started with morning sex with Maggie. They kissed again. Maggie then asked him who his favorite person was. He told her about his mother, who had died two years earlier from ovarian cancer. Maggie related because of her own mother's death. Maggie then inquired if having med conference flings was his thing. He admitted he had hooked up at conferences before, but he had never fallen this hard this fast for anyone. Maggie felt the same way.\n\nBack in bed once again, Winston recalled a time he scrubbed in with Maggie on a piggyback transplant. He was so nervous he was afraid he would drop the donor heart on the floor. Maggie told him she felt like that every time she saw him, except in the OR, where she is a hero. She said she was a neurotic mess in real life outside of the OR. Winston said he could not see that, which made her realize how much at ease she was around him. They were surprised by their alarm clocks. They had talked the entire night. As they got ready for the day, Maggie discovered he would be attending [[Richard Webber|Richard]]'s talk on his PATH pen later and she reminded him who Richard was. Winston thought it would be weird for him to meet Richard on what amounted to their first date, but Maggie said the whole thing had been weird. Yet perfect, he added. Instead of getting ready, they ended up making out again.\n[[File:x-.jpg|Winston asks Maggie to move to Boston.|thumb]]\nThey had breakfast separately, but he found her right before Richard's talk. He asked her to move back to Boston with him. He saw how flustered she was, so he offered to move to Seattle. He insisted that you can meet a person and just know they are the right person for you, and that was how he felt about her. After his mother's death, he had embraced \"carpe diem\" as his motto. He and Maggie quoted their second favorite movie, Dead Poet's Society, once again showing how well they matched are. Maggie said she was a person who needed time to weigh and measure pros and cons before making decisions. He happily agreed to give her the time to do so but he said he knew his feelings about her wouldn't change. They then headed in for the talk, where Richard started showing signs of being unwell. Winston watched from the audience as Maggie got on stage to make Richard stop his talk and get him off the stage. Maggie then walked with Richard on a gurney, past Winston, as they left the conference.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing the conference, Winston returned to Boston and Maggie returned to Seattle, but the two continued their relationship long distance. They video chatted frequently, discussing the pandemic, their patients, the ways in which the virus was disproportionately affecting people of color, and shared how their families were doing. Maggie shared stories about her time spent with her nieces, nephews, and sisters and Winston shared stories about his grandmother and his coworkers.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> After Maggie told him a story about how she had a picnic with [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] that turned into a sleepover on the laundry room floor, Winston bought her a tent and had it shipped to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] house in Seattle. He arranged with [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] and [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]] for it to be set up in the backyard as a surprise for Maggie.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith contracted COVID-, Maggie shared her fears with Winston and he comforted her. During this time, Winston invited Maggie to a virtual family dinner for his grandmother's birthday, which Maggie accepted. The dinner was going well until Winston's father joined the call and proceeded to mock and insult Winston and his intelligence. Winston and his father argued as a result, which ended in Winston leaving the call, leaving Maggie to make awkward small talk with his family. Winston later called Maggie to talk about it, telling her that his Dad makes him crazy and that he seems charming, but he has a temper. To make it up to her, Winston arranged for the two of them to watch the movie Coming to America over video chat.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith woke up after being unconscious for eight days, Maggie shared the good news with Winston over FaceTime. Winston told her he was happy to hear that, but ended the call quickly, saying he was in his car at a grocery store parking lot and needed to go buy eggs, leaving Maggie upset and confused. Later that night, Maggie was alone in her hotel room when someone knocked on the door. She opened it to find Winston, who had brought her flowers from the grocery store. He told her that the long distance thing wasn't working for him anymore and they embraced.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nThe following day he and Maggie ordered room service for breakfast and enjoyed the morning together until [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] knocked on their door and told Maggie that she was needed at home. Winston, Maggie, and Jackson went to Meredith\us house and after confirming that they\ud all been tested recently Link invited them in. Maggie went to talk to Amelia about how to tell the kids about Meredith and Winston joined Link and Jackson in the back for beers. Link paced around the backyard holding Scout who he told them would start crying if he stopped moving while talking about Meredith\us worsening condition and the impact her death would have on the kids, Amelia, and his life in general. Realizing what he just said Link felt guilty, but Winston and Jackson reassured him that it was okay and that they all want Meredith to live and not all of the reasons for that have to be selfless. Winston reassured him by telling him that all they can do is keep moving physically and metaphorically. Link commented that Winston was good at reassuring people considering they just met. He then thanked Jackson for getting Maggie to the house even though he knew it was probably awkward and Winston suddenly realized that Jackson was Maggie's ex.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], X</ref>\n\n\nAfter the unexpected death of [[Andrew DeLuca]], Winston comforted Maggie and did his best to support her, Amelia, and Link. While spending time with Meredith's kids, Winston volunteered to take Maggie's place when Zola told her it was her turn to dance with them and she was unable to do so because of her grief. He offered to show the kids some East Coast dance moves and they gladly accepted. Later that day, Maggie gave Winston hospital privileges and they worked together to treat [[Byron Gibbis]], who was admitted after being found passed out on his front porch. After examining him, Winston diagnosed him with endocarditis, but they couldn't figure out the underlying cause until they took him for a CT scan and Winston asked him if he'd had trouble with his teeth. He said he'd picked a popcorn kernel out with his teeth with a paper clip and had sore gums, but had refused to leave his house to go to the dentist. They were about to begin Gibbis's surgery when he got scared and ran out of the OR naked. Winston and Maggie tracked him down with some help from [[Zander Perez]] and Maggie managed to calm him down and convince him to have the surgery. They helped him back to the OR and the surgery went ahead as planned. He later accompanied Maggie to the outdoor memorial that was held for Andrew.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Maggie gave him privileges, Winston continued to work with her to treat COVID patients at the hospital. They spent time together listening to playlists he created by sharing earbuds. Then the time came for him to go back to Boston as the city had experienced another surge and cases were climbing there and he was needed back at Tufts. Maggie didn't want him to go. The two of them sharing ear buds gave Maggie an idea about how to increase ventilator capacity by having patients share a ventilator by splitting the tube in two and filtering the air to avoid contamination. At the end of their shift, Maggie told Winston her job finally felt fun again and that she knew he was needed back in Boston but that she didn't want to be without him. While Maggie tried to ask him to stay, Winston told her he wanted them to listen to one last song before he left and opened his earbud case to reveal a ring. Winston proposed to Maggie and told her she had an out if she wanted one. Maggie accepted his proposal and they kissed.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Maggie accepted his proposal, Winston travelled back to Boston to tie up lose ends. When he was done, he packed up all of his things and drove back to Seattle. He and Maggie texted and video called frequently during this time and he found an apartment that he wanted Maggie to look at. Maggie took a bit to get back to him and when she did she told him she wasn't a fan of the listing. He told her the landlord of the apartment had called previously to inform him he needed a decision today so he told the landlord he would take it as he needed a better option than a hotel or tent in the backyard. He had been driving for three days and had just left a gas station when he was pulled over by the police while he was on the phone with Maggie. Winston assumed a safe position with his hands on the steering wheel and his license and registration in his hand as a sheriff walked up to this window while his partner circled the car with a drug-sniffing dog. Winston asked him why he was pulled over and upon hearing Maggie's worried voice through the phone, the sheriff checking Winston's license demanded that he turn off his phone. Winston cautiously told him his fianc\uee was worried but ultimately complied, fearing for his life. Maggie then attempted to call him multiple times with no response. When Maggie got called back into a trauma when her patient, [[Guy Houston]], went into V-fib again, she handed her phone to intern [[Sara Ortiz]], explained the situation, and told her to keep calling Winston until he picked up.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Guy needed surgery, Maggie paged Richard and explained the situation and that she hadn't been able to reach Winston for the last  minutes. Richard asked for her phone and told her to focus on her patient and that he'd keep calling and if there a wasn't response in a little while, he would go looking for Winston himself. Maggie had just finished moving a catheter into place when Winston called back. Richard let her know and Owen said he'd finish up so that she could talk to Winston. Winston told her he was fine, but that the police made him do a DUI test, had the police dog sniff him and his car, and then unpacked and ransacked all of his stuff, which was now strewn about the side of the road and then had the dog sniff all of that on the grounds that his bike rack was obscuring his license plate. Winston was shaken up and traumatized, but was relieved to have made it out alive. He told Maggie he wasn't good to drive yet and that he needed a moment to catch his breath, so Maggie stayed on the phone with him. Eventually, he got back on the road after talking to Maggie and a couple of hours later arrived at Meredith's house. Maggie and Amelia were waiting on the porch for him. When he arrived, Maggie ran over and embraced him and he told her he thought only about surviving to get back to her. In response, Maggie kissed him.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing his move to Seattle, Winston joined the staff of Grey Sloan Memorial as an attending and worked with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] on Meredith\us case. Her labs showed elevated liver enzymes, so they did a CT of her chest and abdomen. After discovering a clot in her liver Winston declined to do the necessary TIPS procedure because Meredith was his future sister-in-law and said Teddy should do it instead. Teddy prepared to do the procedure herself, but then changed her mind after talking to [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] and had him page Winston to assist. The procedure was successful, but Meredith still wasn\ut able to stay awake, so Winston suggested to Richard that they bring Zola to visit her mom because he thought that hearing and feeling her daughter next to her might help. At first Maggie refused to bring her, but after Zola overheard her talking and said she wanted to go Maggie brought her to the hospital. After putting her in PPE Winston, Maggie, and Richard walked Zola to Meredith\us room and waited outside to see if it would help. At first there was no change, but then Meredith woke up and started talking to Zola. Seeing this Winston celebrated with Maggie, Richard, Amelia, [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]], and Teddy.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref>\n\nIn the weeks that followed Winston worked with Maggie, Teddy, Owen, and Link to treat COVID patients. After getting engaged Winston and Maggie asked Richard to officiate their wedding and he gladly accepted saying it would be the honor of his life.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref> Following their engagement, Winston and Maggie began wedding planning. They got into a disagreement when Maggie told him she wanted everything to feel right instead of a compromise and suggested they wait until things open up a bit more. Winston became upset because he thought she was all in and that she was getting cold feet. Three weeks later, Maggie met Winston in the hospital parking lot and told him that none of his ideas were perfect and that she had finally figured out what had been bothering her. She realized that perfect was never going to be an option because her mother wouldn\ut be there and the feeling that something was wrong never had anything to do with him. She just wished her mother could have met him. Winston told her he missed his own mom as well, that his mom taught him how to dance, and would\uve torn up the dance floor at their wedding. Maggie then suggested they take the engagement ring that her mother gave her and turn it into her wedding band and that she didn\ut want to wait to have the wedding. That they should get her dad and his grandmother to Seattle as soon as possible and just do the wedding with family and then have a big party when it's safe to do so. Winston told her he was good with that idea and Maggie said she was relieved before turning towards a parked car and revealing that she had flown her dad [[Bill Pierce|Bill]] and Winston\us grandmother [[Antoinette Ndugu|Antoinette]] out for the wedding. They wanted to hug them, but couldn\ut until they had quarantined for  days. None the less they were delighted to see each other.<ref>[[I'm Still Standing]], x</ref>\n\n\nIn August , Winston and Maggie attempted to get married at a small ceremony in Meredith's backyard with Antoinette, Bill, [[Catherine Fox|Catherine]], Link, and Meredith and her kids in attendance. However, when Richard asked if anyone objected to the union Antoinette and Bill stood up and said that they did because they both thought that the couple deserved a bigger ceremony than this and that it wasn't right to do it this way because Amelia wasn't there, having been called into work at the last minute for an emergent patient, and Maggie had uncles, aunts, and cousins who weren't there. Bill said he had a savings account to do this the right way and that's what they wanted for them. Maggie told them they couldn't do it the proper way because it wasn't safe. Bill suggested that they wait as they were already living together so they couldn't be in that much of a hurry. Winston and Maggie then agreed to postpone the wedding. In April , when it was safe to do so Winston and Maggie got married at the beach with all of their friends and family that they wanted in attendance. They had Meredith walk down the aisle with her kids and spread flower petals at the start of the ceremony then Bill walked Maggie down the aisle. This time no one objected and the wedding went ahead as planned. While Meredith and Teddy had to leave early to perform a lung transplant on one of their patients, everyone else stayed and enjoyed the reception and dancing with Winston and Maggie.<ref>[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter his mother's death, he adapted a \"carpe diem\" mentality. He is a charming and humorous man. He likes to dance and has been shown to be good with kids. \n\n\n\nWinston had a crush on his superior, Maggie Pierce, starting the first day of his residency training under her. He bided his time to ask her out on a date, but she left Boston right before he became an attending. When they met up at a conference after not seeing each other since she moved to Seattle, they hooked up in his hotel room. After spending the night together, he suggested that she move back to Boston or offered to move to Seattle so they could be together. When she said she needed time to make big decisions like that, he said she should take the time she needed and assured her the way he felt wouldn't change.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> Following the conference, Winston returned to Boston and Maggie returned to Seattle, but the two continued their relationship long distance.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref> They video chatted frequently, but eventually Winston grew tired of the long distance and came to Seattle to be with Maggie.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref> He later proposed to her and they are now married.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>  \n\n\nHe says his mom was his favorite person in the world. She was his protector. She died of ovarian cancer two years before he reunited with Maggie. While describing his mother's protective side, he mentioned that his mother wouldn't let his father mess with him, indicating they have a strained relationship<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> which was confirmed when Maggie attended a virtual dinner party for his grandmother's birthday and the two argued, resulting in Winston leaving the call early.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref> Winston is very close to his grandmother [[Antoinette Ndugu|Antoinette]].<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe is an attending cardiothoracic surgeon at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].

Richard told him to go to do it anyway and he did.\n\nLater, when Catherine came to the hospital looking for Richard, Zander asked her to wait so he could page Richard because Richard had been having coffee with his wife, meaning Gemma. Catherine informed him that she is Richard's wife. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nWhen Pac-North was purchased and closed, Zander was hired to continue his residency at Grey Sloan. Bailey sent him and the other residents to do a skills lab with Richard Webber. However, Richard became discouraged during the lab and sent all the residents home early. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\n\nDuring COVID-, Zander took shifts outside the hospital, taking patients' temperatures and directing them where to go. When one patient came in with a rash, Zander took his temperature and directed him into the ER. When he said he didn't want a Chinese doctor, Zander told him he could go back to the parking lot and hope he didn't die of anaphylactic shock. The patient decided to enter the hospital instead. ''(\uc[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\ud)''\n\nZander came to tell Bailey that Catherine was ready for their meeting. When he saw that Bailey was injured, he asked if he should tell her to wait and if so, could someone else tell her because he's not Catherine's favorite person. Bailey said she'd be there soon. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nWhen a patient, [[Byron Gibbis]], ran through the hospital nude because he was scared to have surgery, Zander saw him and pointed the doctors in his direction when they came looking for him. Later, he reminded everyone at Andrew's memorial that even though they were outside, they still needed to maintain their social distance. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Vic and Travis brought [[Charlie (Station )|Charlie]] to the hospital after his second overdose in three days, Zander informed them that it was his third visit in a month. When they brought in [[Libby]] next, he wasn't surprised to learn that she was Charlie's friend. ''(\"[[No One is Alone]]\")''\n\n\nWhen it started to look like Meredith would get discharged, Richard asked Zander to prepare a clap-out, but keep it quiet as he wanted it to be a surprise. He did so, but when Meredith got discharged, she disappeared and Zander had to tell everyone she wasn't in her room. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, Zander was excited to learn from her. Inspired by Meredith, he asked to listen to [[Gerlie Bernardo|Gerlie's]] lungs before she was discharged, as he hadn't gotten the chance to listen to lungs that had recovered from COVID. Starting in October , Meredith cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, Zander was able to get his first dose of the COVID- vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April , Gerlie got her lungs while Zander attended Maggie and Winston's wedding. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them  seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total, thirteen patients were treated using this method. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\nThe residents enjoyed this new teaching method and eagerly awaited each day. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\nZander was assigned to do an appendecomy one day. As he went to close, he asked the nurse which suture would be better to use. ''(\"[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\")''\n\nWhen The Webber Method led to the death of [[Devon Gomez]], Zander attended the M&M conference designed to determine how his death could have been prevented. At the conference, when questioning targeted The Webber Method and its role in his death, Zander said that Richard was just thinking of their education.\n\nThat same day, Zander treated [[Lila Hanley]] in the ER. Lila had severe pain below her knee, which had previously been treated with cortisone shots. After a thorough exam, Zander tried to tell Link that Lila needed an MRI, but Link ignored him and told Lila that if she wanted a more permanent solution, she should try losing weight. This offended Lila, who got up and went to leave, which is when Link noticed she had foot drop, something Zander had already noticed. Lila got an MRI, which showed a herniated disk, which was causing her pain. Zander called Link out on this, saying Link should have taken the time to see beyond her BMI. Bailey backed him up, telling him to stop looking at patients' BMI, which was not a good measure of anyone's health. In Lila's surgery, Link let Zander do the discectomy. ''(\"[[Living In a House Divided]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Levi quit, the other residents were only getting assigned simple procedures, which they considered a form of punishment. When Richard didn't show up for work, they questioned what they were supposed to do. Meredith, who was operating on [[David Hamilton]] that day, went to Hamilton and asked if she could use his surgery as a teaching opportunity and allow all hospital staff to observe. The residents were eager to be part of this. Before the surgery started, Meredith explained what they were doing and gave them time to ask questions. The surgery then proceeded and went well. ''(\"[[Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] stepped in to act as chief for the day so Bailey could operate and cover the shortage of surgeons, Zander scrubbed in with her on multiple surgeries, sharing in her joy of operating. Then he went to the gallery to watch Maggie operate on [[Fernanda Lima]], who have traveled to Seattle from Boston with her family to have heart surgery. However, had to leave with Owen came in and told the residents they needed to leave to help cover the physician shortage. Specifically, he said that Zander was assigned to general so he should be assisting another surgeon in another OR. ''(\"[[Road Trippin']]\")''\n\n\nZander and the other residents were called to do grand rounds with [[Nick Marsh]] and [[Meredith Grey]]. They arrived to find Nick with the patient, Mason Taylor, who was brain dead after being struck by a drunk driver. His wife wanted to donate his organs, but UNOS rejected them, so she donated his body for research. Nick explained that they would be transplanting a genetically modified pig kidney into Mason's body in the hopes that they could perfect the technology, which would eliminate the wait for donor organs. He transplanted the kidney near the groin so they had better blood supply and could see the kidney as they waited to see if it would work. After the surgery, they celebrated that the kidney was producing urine. When the kidney later stopped working, Nick had them do a biopsy and sent the residents away to avoid screaming at them. Then he did everything he could to save the kidney, but started to lose faith. Meredith suggested using epinephrine, which worked and Jordan reported that the kidney was working again. ''(\"[[Put It to the Test]]\")''\n\n\nZander helped Winston and Maggie when they were testing a medical device [[Wendell Ndugu]] was attempting to sell. When the patch showed that the patient had no heartbeat, Winston tested it on himself and concluded that it didn't work when it gave the same readout. ''(\"[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]\")''\n\n\nZander was working the day that [[Jamarah Blake]] returned to the hospital to evaluate the program to see if it could remain open. He helped out with a blood drive they held that day in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the nationwide blood shortage. He then watched as Meredith and Nick attempted to remove [[Cora|Cora's]] tumor in an ex-vivo surgery. During this surgery, he accidentally informed Jamarah Blake that Meredith was leaving the hospital. ''(\"[[Out for Blood]]\")''\n\nLater, he and the other residents spread the word on social media that the hospital needed blood, drawing in several donors. At the end of the day, when the surgical residency program was shut down, he packed up his things. ''(\"[[You Are the Blood]]\")''\n\n\nHe is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\n*He drinks Kombucha.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[A Diagnosis]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[The Center Won't Hold]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[It's All Too Much]]\nSxZanderPerez.png|[[No One is Alone]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Tradition]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Hotter Than Hell]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[Out for Blood]]\nxZanderPerez.png|[[You Are the Blood]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Zander Perez Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Zander Perez]]\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Perez, Zander}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}
