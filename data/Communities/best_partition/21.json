They started searching for a bone marrow donor, but ethnic donors are scarce, so they were never able to find one. However, they were able to treat his condition with enzyme injections. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\n\nBraden's parents brought him into the GSM ER when he became congested. He was given antibiotics and IVIG to treat the sinusitis. However, he also had a bump on his forehead which he thought was a zit but was actually a Pott's Puffy Tumor. He was taken in to surgery to have it drained. In surgery, the doctors noted cerebral spinal fluid, meaning that the abscess had penetrated his brain, meaning they needed to call in Dr. Shepherd. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\n\nAfter surgery, Braden was put into an isolation room because the enzyme injections had stopped working, leaving him vulnerable to infection. He woke up and was scared when he saw where he was. His parents assured him through the plastic barrier that they weren't leaving him and they love him. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-op, Braden's infection had cleared up. However, his T-cell count was still zero, so he had to remain in isolation. He used a remote control car to break through the plastic and escape to play tag with [[Francesca McNeil|Frankie McNeil]], but he was quickly found and taken back into isolation. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]] had the idea to use deactivated HIV to deliver the enzyme to Braden's body. His parents were initially concerned about the use of HIV, but Dr. Bailey assured them that she was not going to give Braden HIV. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nAfter receiving chemotherapy to kill off the enzyme-deficient bone marrow, Braden contracted a viral infection, concerning his parents. Worried that the treatment would make Braden even sicker, Teresa withdrew consent for the gene therapy. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morrises, Bailey proceeded with the gene therapy as planned. It went well and Braden's T-cell count was up to . He beat the infection and was able to start eating solid food again. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the treatment, Braden improved enough that Bailey felt comfortable discharging him. However, before she could do that, she had to inform his parents that she had gone ahead with the treatment. When she told them, they began to doubt the results. They also decided the press charges against Bailey for assault and battery. Owen and Jackson were able to assure them that the results were as she said they were, but not to drop the charges.\n\nStephanie Edwards lied and told them that she had forgotten to tell Bailey that they had withdrawn consent and it was entirely her fault. That still didn't convince them until they held their son and they agreed to drop the charges in exchange for Dr. Edwards being suspended for a week. ''(\"[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]]\")''\n\n\nAfter being discharged, Braden had a follow-up with his pediatrician and he was very healthy. ''(\"[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\")''\n\n\n\nBraden is annoyed by his parents, who are constantly worried about him because of his condition. He brushes off their attention and dislikes their nicknames for him.\n\n\n[[Francesca McNeil]]\nDuring his time in isolation, Braden befriended Frankie McNeil, who would visit his room and share gossip with him.

She was confused and her words didn't make sense. When she went behind the nurses' station and picked up the phone, Nathan and Andrew tried to remove her, but she collapsed to the floor.

He agreed to join both of them. While he was in the OR with Burke, they talked about Cristina and Burke was shocked to hear they'd been together for three years.\n\nHe then observed Derek's surgery. While Derek was operating, [[Helen Crawford|the patient]] had a cardiac episode and he had to open her chest, aspirate an air embolism, and do open cardiac massage. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\n\nColin prepared a ten-year plan for the hospital which he presented during his interview with the board.

He invited both Cristina and Burke to scrub in with him. However, in surgery, Colin critiqued Burke's technique and ultimately said it would be better if he simply observed.\n\n\nAfter the surgery, Colin watched Cristina talking to Burke.

[[Preston Burke|Burke]] became very offended by this realization but Cristina assured him it was nothing. Cristina tried to avoid him by hiding, but he found her, and she confronted him by telling him that she was in a real relationship and would no longer include him in her love life. He continued to flirt with Cristina, but she yelled at him and told him to leave her be, and that she was happy without him, saying she moved on. Eventually he left as he felt the Cristina he knew before no longer existed and the job was beneath him anyway.\n\n\n[[Preston Burke]] had initially intended to befriend him (due to his great success) and introduced himself to Dr. Marlow with a smile. Marlow rudely passed Burke and hugged Cristina. Burke realized that Colin was touching Cristina's butt. Cristina told Burke that she was with Colin for  years. Burke became upset with Cristina, but even more so, Colin. He no longer liked Colin or anything to do with him. Burke was still upset, and started being rude to Colin. Colin was confused, but later saw that he really loved Cristina.\n\n\nDr. Colin Marlow was a [[Attending|professor]] at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] and a brilliant, admired, and legendary [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] noted for pioneering a procedure called the Marlow transplant.

Don't disappoint.|'''[[Craig Thomas]] to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]'''}}\n\n'''Dr. Craig Thomas''' was an [[Attending|attending]] [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] who worked at the [[Mayo Clinic]] with and mentored [[Cristina Yang]] after officiating her [[Board Certification|boards]].\n\n\n\nAfter telling Cristina that he knew she had been in a plane crash, he revealed he was the sole survivor of a plane crash in Vietnam and talked to her about the guilt that they both felt. ''(\"[[Love the One You're With]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina took her boards at the end of her residency, Dr. Thomas was one of her boards examiners. She quickly became frustrated with his old-fashioned approach to medicine. ''(\"[[Let the Bad Times Roll]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina left Seattle to work at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, she was displeased to see that Dr. Thomas worked there. She was very reluctant to sit and listen to his stories. He invited her to watch him operate and while observing, she criticized his technique the whole time.\n\nWhen he invited himself to operate on one of her patients, she stood up to him and insisted that she would be operating. ''(\"[[Going, Going, Gone]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina questioned him performing a ventricular reduction instead of placing an L-VAD, a much safer option, he insisted that he could do it and that he wanted to go for a repair instead of a bandage. In surgery, he greatly impressed her by closing without using felt pledgets. It was his signature. He was the only one in the country who was able to do it because he had dedicated his life to perfecting it. He encouraged Cristina to figure out her own signature move. ''(\"[[Love the One You're With]]\")''\n\nWhen he had a surgical plan that would take  hours, she proposed an alternate solution that would take half the time and would only use one incision. He initially rejected that plan, saying that they weren't a pizza delivery service. However, after she put a little pressure on him, he agreed to change his plan, much to the surprise of [[Darren Parker]].\n\nIn the surgery, Dr. Thomas had a problem with the catheter and asked Cristina to take over. However, she instead coached him through it and he was able to pass the wire. When she offered to take over and do the next part for him, he refused and finished the surgery himself.\n\nThat night, they went out for drinks together. He showed her his watch and said it was given to him by the hospital at a surprise retirement party four years prior. It's a cheap piece of junk, but he wears it to screw with them. She made fun of him for ordering an Old Fashioned, but then laughed and ordered one for herself. ''(\"[[I Saw Her Standing There]]\")''\n\nWhen Cristina's car was buried in snow, she called Dr. Thomas to come get her and he brought her a danish and brought her a case. Dr. Thomas and Cristina operated on the largest aneurysm Dr. Thomas had ever seen, despite Dr. Parker's protests. After that surgery, a second surgery was planned on the [[Katy Noonan|same patient]] to repair a heart defect, but Dr. Parker put him on probation. Despite being on probation, Dr. Thomas proceeded with the second surgery. While operating, Dr. Thomas suffered a heart attack. Despite Dr. Parker's best efforts, he died in the OR. ''(\"[[Beautiful Doom]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe had no family and no children.\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nHe was a mentor for [[Cristina Yang]] until his death. She was initially reluctant to learn from him, sure that he had nothing to teach her. However, after seeing him directly suture myocardium, she was impressed by his skill and began a more agreeable relationship with him. She frequently joked about his age, both to him and to patients. He told her that she loves him more than anyone had in a very long time. In surgery, he advised her not to hold her breath because when you stop breathing, you stop thinking. He told her that she'd be the surgeon of her generation and he wanted it to be known that he helped train her.

He's very dreamy, but he's not the sun, you are.|'''Cristina Yang''' to '''[[Meredith Grey]]'''}}\n\n'''Cristina Yang''' is a researcher, Chief Medical Officer, and Director of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]], having been trained at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], and [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She was engaged to [[Preston Burke]] and had a tumultuous relationship and marriage with [[Owen Hunt]]. She is also [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] [[Person(s)|person]].\n\n\n\nCristina is of Korean descent raised in Judaism (her mother converted upon re-marriage) and a native of Beverly Hills, California. Though Jewish, she has stated that she is not religious.\n\nAt her high school prom, her mom made her go with her best friend's son, whom Cristina said was a dork. She was okay with providing the kid a date, but once they got to the party, he tried to get sexual with her and touch her in front of the entire school by the punch bowl. He then threw up all over her dress because he was nervous to touch her.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nHer mother married Cristina's stepfather, [[Saul Rubenstein|Dr. Saul Rubenstein]], an oral surgeon, when Cristina was three. Cristina's biological father died when she was nine years old in a car accident; Cristina watched her father bleed out before help arrived, attempting to close his chest with her hands, to try to stop the bleeding. Cristina felt his last heartbeat in her hands. She claims this is the reason she became a doctor, and could very likely be the motive behind her interest in [[Cardiothoracic Surgery]].\n\n\nCristina is a graduate of [[Smith College]]. She earned her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she earned her M.D. from [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], where she graduated first of her class.\n\n\nCristina ended up pregnant after a sexual encounter with [[Preston Burke]]. She scheduled an abortion soon after she found out she was pregnant. She put off telling Burke about the pregnancy, and made the decision not to tell him after he broke things off with her. During a thoracotomy with Dr. Burke she began sweating and having severe pain and eventually collapsed in the [[Operating Room|OR]], seriously scaring Burke. [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] and [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] helped her and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] finally operated on her. One of her fallopian tubes had burst and she was bleeding out. Earlier, Cristina didn't seem so attached to the pregnancy and tried to convince everyone that she was fine but at the end of the day she finally broke down and she cried hysterically. When Burke came to visit her, he got into the bed beside her and held her.\n\n\nDuring the [[Hospital Shooting|hospital shooting]], Cristina and Meredith initially didn't take the lockdown alert seriously. They assumed lockdown meant not leaving the building and so lackadaisically wandered around. Derek found them and ordered them into a supply closet to hide. Cristina was peeking out of the window and saw the shooter, recognizing the man who asked for directions to Chief [[Derek Shepherd|Derek Shepherd's]] office. Cristina immediately realized that Derek's life was in danger, but once she divulged that Derek was one of the intended targets Meredith couldn't stand staying in place. Cristina tried to bodily stop her, but Meredith shoved her aside and ran out into the hallway.\nThey witnessed Derek and the shooter's stand-off. Cristina held back Meredith from intervening and possibly getting shot herself. After Derek was shot in the chest and the shooter walked away the two sprang into action. With the help of April Kepner, they got him down to the ER. There they found Jackson Avery who had a few scrub nurses and an anesthesiologist. Cristina begged [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] not to watch saying that it would distract her; implying that Meredith's pain would be the thing that would push her over the edge. Cristina said that gunshot wounds are always a little unpredictable. Cristina realized that the bullet was next to the aortic valve thus complicating the procedure all the more.\nUnfortunately the unthinkable happened and the shooter entered the OR with Cristina operating on Derek. He held Cristina and everyone at gunpoint demanding they stop and let Derek die. He warned that if Cristina continued operating, he would kill her. Owen tried to attack and apprehend the shooter but he himself was shot. Owen crumpled onto the ground and the gun was turned back onto doctors around the table. To defuse the situation Jackson pulled out the wires connecting Derek to the heart rate monitor making it look like Derek flatlined. Appeased, the shooter left the room and Cristina starting working again. She successfully saved Derek's life, but the incident traumatized her so completely that for months afterward Cristina practically refused to operate. Meredith and April operated on Owen Hunt's gunshot wound in a different OR. After Cristina finished with Derek, she went to visit Owen and agreed to marry him.\n\nAfter the shooting, Cristina and Meredith were the some of last to be cleared for surgery by the trauma counselor. Neither of them were truly dealing with their fallout; instead Cristina threw herself into planning her wedding. She hoped that she would be different, more steady afterwards but it did not help her PTSD. Owen convinced Richard to go over the trauma counselor's head and clear Cristina for surgery. Owen and Teddy thought that some cutting would jumpstart her recovery, bring the old Cristina back to the surface, but instead she had a PTSD episode in the OR. Jackson Avery accidentally dropped a tray of tools and the loud noise triggered Cristina. Meredith rushed in to comfort her; Meredith laid on the floor with Cristina until she was ready to get up. \n\nCristina went downhill from there. Derek first fought for her not to leave the program, insisting that because he owed her his life, he would help her through this. She worked with him in neuro for a while. When Derek's sister Amelia was visiting she even called Cristina a \"dud\" because of her reluctance to do even hold a retractor. Owen and Teddy made repeated efforts to engage, but Cristina was apathetic. The attendings tried to give her easy cases, understanding of her PSTD. Also during this time, Cristina and Meredith's friendship was tense. Cristina becomes frustrated that Meredith was seemingly recovered while she was still messed up. Cristina insisting that Meredith's wails to save her husband were part of the reason why she was still suffering.\n\nEventually, Cristina quit the program entirely. First, she and Torres organized a housewarming party. Derek warned her that Owen, Teddy, and Meredith were planning an intervention and the two of them spent the party on the roof drinking and talking about home renovation. Derek consistently was supportive of Cristina moving at her own pace. Meredith was convinced that Cristina wouldn't be fine until she returned to work. Derek, however, said that as long as Cristina was all right it didn't matter if she rejoined the program. Even when Cristina briefly become a bartender at Joe's and spent the night drinking and dancing like a party girl. Derek spent the night watching out for her until Owen came to take a very inebriated Cristina home. \n\nCristina went on a fishing trip with Derek to the surprise and shock of Meredith and Teddy. Owen however just wanted someone to spend time with Cristina during the day. Cristina did a lot of research the night before and quickly become frustrated with the lack of progress. Derek commented that she just needed to be quiet and patient, that fishing was about being relaxing. Cristina said that she couldn't just turn off her brain therein indicating she was becoming frustrated with the lack of intellectual stimulus in her new unemployed existence. Eventually, when she did catch a fish, a  pounder, Cristina got her picture taken with it but suddenly she started crying. It seemed that finally, Cristina was ready to begin healing.\n\n\nCristina found out she was pregnant, but did not want a child. When she told Owen she was going to have an abortion, he got very upset because even though he knew Cristina never wanted children, he wanted children. During their argument over the matter, she yelled again that she was saying no to a baby, leading him to kick her out of the firehouse. Cristina packed her stuff and moved in with Meredith. \n\nSince Derek left Meredith over her tampering with his trial, Cristina helped Meredith take care of Zola, of whom Meredith had been granted temporary custody. Cristina meanwhile tried to reach out to Owen, but he ignored her calls and walked away from her in the hospital every time she tried to tell him that she didn't get the abortion yet, as she didn't go through with it the first time. However, she was determined to have the abortion, with or without him, during her second appointment that night. While Teddy came around and told Cristina she would start teaching her again, Cristina found out that Meredith had been fired by the hospital board, leading Cristina to start hating Alex and urging Meredith to find a way to fight the board's decision. Cristina had a busy and boring day at work, as Teddy's new plan was to teach Cristina all about the basics, which Cristina skipped during her first years of residency because she was so talented. When Meredith informed Cristina that her new plan was to be a stay-at-home mother for Zola, Meredith questioned if Cristina if she wanted to be a mom too, which may have been the reason she didn't go through with the abortion the first time. Cristina assured her she did not want to be a mother; she wanted to be a surgeon and she really needed someone to get that, hoping Owen would be that person to support her decision, but she guessed he never would show up for the abortion.<ref>[[Free Falling]], x</ref>\n\nNoticing how the relationships between the fifth-year residents had deteriorated, Callie and Bailey organized a Gunther, some sort of test to see which one of the residents would step up as the leader while treating a patient. As suspected by most of the attendings, Cristina took the lead in the OR right until she accidentally administered epi to Alex, arresting his heart. Cristina immediately stopped operating and revived him with a crash cart. Although the epi revealed an underlying arrhythmia, Cristina admitted to Teddy that she moved too fast and made a mistake. Cristina was then paged to the hospital basement by Meredith, who had disappeared with Zola hours ago, because they were probably going to take her away. She promised a panicking Meredith she would fix it. \n\nShe did not get an abortion at the first appointment because Owen was threatening a divorce and she did not want to upset him so she waited to talk to him and then got another appointment to have an abortion. Owen came with her to the appointment and held her hand.\n\nOwen was upset with Cristina and so went out for a drink with a patient's friend. They both got drunk and on their way home she asked him to kiss her. He told her that he was married. She told him to kiss her anyway, which he did. One thing led to another and they had sex.\n\n\nDuring her final year of residency, Cristina was approached by many hospitals to join their programs. Many offered incentives, such as research labs and funding, as well as fruit baskets and Broadway tickets. While most other residents were flying around the country participating in interviews, Cristina was content to be wooed and let the heads of department come to her. Following the plane crash, she elected to leave [[Seattle]] to work at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota.\n\n\nTogether with Meredith, Derek, Lexie, Arizona, and Mark, Cristina boarded a plane that was supposed to take them to a hospital in Boise where they would assist on a surgery to separate conjoined twins. However, the back of the plane broke off during the flight, resulting in the plane crashing in the woods.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the crash, Cristina's shoulder was dislocated and she somehow lost one of her shoes. She helped a confused Meredith get back up and told her that the plane crashed. Meredith also couldn't find Derek lying around anywhere, and Cristina remembered that he was sucked out the side when the plane hit the trees and that the back of the plane came off. Meanwhile, Arizona kept on screaming in pain until Cristina yelled at her to shut up. When they heard a banging sound, she, Meredith, and Mark followed it and found Lexie trapped under the part of the plane that broke off. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Mark popping Cristina's shoulder back in.]]\n\nWhile Meredith went off looking for Derek, Cristina and Mark stayed with Lexie. Mark popped Cristina's shoulder back in and put her arm in an improvised sling, after which they tried to lift the part of the plane to release Lexie, though they were unsuccessful. Cristina asked Lexie about her condition, and she replied that her legs and pelvis were crushed and that she was not sure her left arm was still there. Both she and Cristina realized that Lexie wasn't going to make it, though Mark convinced a teary-eyed Cristina to go back the front part of the plane to get fluids and oxygen tanks.\n\nBack at the front part of the plane she stabilized Jerry's spine. Jerry, the pilot, told them that the rescue team should be there in four hours. While looking for supplies for the stabilization, Cristina found a flare gun, and when Jerry asked her about his potentially paralyzed legs, she got a pen and stuck it into his leg. He didn't react, and she apologized, indicating that they were indeed paralyzed. Cristina then got bottles of water, and Meredith came back saying she hadn't found Derek yet. She wanted to continue looking for him, though Cristina said she should come with her to Lexie first.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Cristina and Meredith find out Lexie has passed away.]]\n\nHowever, when they arrived at the back part of the plane, they found a devastated Mark next to Lexie, who had only succumbed to her injuries seconds ago. Cristina sat down and started staring in front of her while mourning the loss. She and Meredith eventually decided to go look for Derek, until he appeared with a bleeding hand. \n\nCristina went back to the front part of the plane to look for supplies to treat Derek's hand the best way possible. Cristina returned to the back part of the plane, where she handed the supplies she found over to Meredith, who closed the tear in Derek's hand with a safety pin. Meanwhile, Cristina wanted to start a fire using matches she found, and urged Mark to help her, but she noticed he was really weak. As he didn't react, she tore open his shirt, revealing he had a massive cardiac tamponade. Cristina then instructed Meredith on how to do a pericardiocentesis, which Meredith pulled off successfully. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|The plane crash victims.]]\n\nAfter that, they dragged Mark back to the front part of the plane, to Arizona. They informed her on what happened and Cristina gave Meredith the  remaining matches to build a fire when suddenly a helicopter passed. They tried to fire the flare gun, but it didn't work. They slept through the night, waiting for help to arrive.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\nCristina was the only one who was awake when the rescue helicopter finally came to rescue the plane crash victims. She stepped into the light and waved to get the pilot's attention. She was taken to the Boise Hospital with the others, where Cristina kept on fighting the doctors. They sedated her and tied her to her bed. When Owen arrived, the Chief of Boise told him she thought that Cristina was in a state of reactive psychosis.\n\nCristina was sedated again before being flown back to Seattle. She remained in her state of reactive psychosis, refusing to speak. While she just laid in bed, her sight was blurry and every sound was muted in her ears. The doctors at Seattle tried to help her, but she didn't react to anything they tried. She reacted for the first time when a couple of interns were talking about her outside her room. She grabbed a vase and threw it at the window, after which the interns ran off. When [[Dr. Hurst|another doctor]] interfered with Cristina's case and yelled at Owen and Bailey that she belongs in psych, Meredith once again urged Cristina to talk, but it didn't have any effect.\n\nHowever, at some point, Owen decided to take her home with him. In the tub, Owen assured her they could figure it out, but Cristina replied that she could never get out. She finally started talking about what happened during the four days they were in the woods. She stayed awake every minute of those days and tried to take care of the other doctors, clearing the bugs out of Arizona's leg and keeping Mark alive. While everyone was asleep, she took care of everyone under the very dark sky. Out of necessity, she had to drink her pee and even the fuel from the plane. She also tried to keep the wild animals off Lexie's body, but wasn't successful doing so.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nSoon after, Cristina got out of her state and made plans to relocate to Minnesota, where she took a job at the Mayo Clinic. Before taking off, Cristina had a discussion with Meredith, who was worried that Cristina was just running away. Cristina admitted she was just fleeing from Seattle, where horrible things kept happening to her. Meredith wanted to stick together, but Cristina only advised Meredith to leave too. An angry Meredith then yelled that Cristina's person was Cristina herself and that she should just leave. Cristina then got in her car and drove off to Minnesota. After their fight, she and Meredith didn't have contact for a couple of months until Meredith left her a voice mail to tell her that Seattle also meant positive things to her, for example, it's the place where she met Cristina. Cristina then called her back to tell her that Meredith was still her person, and that she always would be.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n[[File:Christinainmayoclinic.jpg|thumb|xpx|Cristina in Minnesota]]\n\nHowever, at the Mayo Clinic, Cristina had some difficulties fitting in. She was tasked to \"babysit\" [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]], a very old surgeon with boring stories. She constantly FaceTimed with Meredith when not operating, and made plans to fly to Seattle when Mark would be taken off life support. She had tried to fly to Seattle previously, but chickened out every time. She promised Meredith that this time, it would be different. Later that day, she revealed she wasn't really in a hurry to get to Seattle, as Mark would still be in a coma whenever she arrived at Seattle. She missed her flight when she operated with Dr. Thomas observing her, though she thought about Mark when it was  o'clock in Seattle. After the surgery, Cristina asked [[Darren Parker|Dr. Parker]] to steer Dr. Thomas into someone else's direction, even though she insisted she was a team player. However, Dr. Parker ordered her to take a couple of days off to soften her sharp Seattle edges. That night, she FaceTimed with Meredith again and they agreed they needed to get over their fear of flying, as neither of them was able to fly to the other one.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nBefore the plane crash was going to be investigated, the plane company offered the group of doctors a one-time settlement.  The doctors had to decide unanimously, but taking the settlement would mean there wouldn't be an investigation. During one of their regular, short phone conversations, Owen informed her about the settlement and she promised to call him in three days when she would make her decision. She returned to work the next day after her days off, where she faked a story about having visited the Mall of America. He figured out she just googled it, but she assured him she was ready to be a team player. He ordered her to work with Thomas, only believing team playing when he sees it. Later that day, she complained to Parker about Thomas's conservative approach. He promised her she'd join him in the OR very soon to learn cutting edge surgery, but she had to take her turn in babysitting the old guy. This urged her to try to do her best to fit in, even smiling on command. During a FaceTime with Meredith, Cristina told her she and Owen only talked about the settlement and that she would just agree with what the others would decide about the settlement since she was a team player now. In surgery with Thomas, he confessed having googled her but continued to teach her when she told she preferred to talk about medicine. She was impressed with his techniques, despite them being conservative. Cristina called Owen an hour before the settlement meeting, telling him she was fine with whatever the group decided. She also said they couldn't keep calling each other because she was beginning a new life in Minnesota.\n\nAt the end of the day, an emotional Cristina sat down on a bench outside the hospital, where Thomas joined her. He revealed he once had been in a plane crash too, and he never talked about it. They started talking about how everything, like cigarettes, seems to kill you these days, which started off their friendship.<ref>[[Love the One You're With]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, she started a sexual relationship with Dr. Parker, resulting in quickies in his office. Through her, Parker was informed on the old surgical procedures that Thomas doing. During a phone call with Meredith, Cristina revealed that having sex was her way of trying to fit in, making friends. She confessed she didn't even like Parker, but it's not necessary to like a sex friend. However, she became regular friends with the ancient guy, telling Meredith he was her bestie, the Minnesota version of Meredith. She reassured Meredith that Parker was fine and that it was just a way to get an orgasm. Cristina and Craig Thomas worked together, with her constantly making jokes about his age. While practicing for her surgery with Thomas, Parker asked her if she even suggested a less invasive approach. She did, a procedure that would only take half the time, but he asked her if they were a hospital or a pizza delivery service, and if they needed to have it done in  minutes or less. Parker and Cristina agreed he was stubborn, but Cristina pointed out there were also advantages to Thomas' procedure. \"Enjoy him while you can,\" Parker said as Cristina returned to Craig. She asked if this meant she was off probation soon, but he didn't answer. \n\nIn the evening, Cristina went to Darren Parker's house to ask him what his deal was with Dr. Thomas. He was disappointed because she came to him to talk about Thomas rather than having sex. He asked her to come, which she only did because it was cold outside. She asked if he was firing Thomas. Parker said they couldn't fire Thomas, only force him to retire. He said that telling her this broke a whole lot of board regulations, but she interrupted him and asked him to name one mistake Thomas had made. He hadn't, but when he did, his age would make it an instant malpractice suit that the hospital would lose. He added that Thomas was years behind in his medical education, which she said herself. He questioned if Craig refused to try the minimally invasive technique because he was stubborn or because he didn't know how to. Cristina realized that is why Parker had had her working with Thomas, because she represents everything that is new, smart, and advanced in their field, which is his exact opposite. When the time would come to make a case, it would be helpful if she were to help them do it. Cristina angrily said that he should've told her and left his house, with him saying he thought she'd never have a problem with it.\n\nThe next day at work, Cristina once again asked Thomas why they weren't doing the minimally invasive technique. He replied it was because they had a surgical plan, but she said she thought he rejected her pitches because they scared him. He thought she had learned something from him. She had, that mortality was breathing down his neck and that he was running from the future like a scared old chicken. He said he was perfectly able of threading a catheter, so she dared him to prove her wrong. While she was scrubbing in for the surgery, Parker came in and asked her what she said to him to make him change his plan, thinking he could legally get in trouble if she told Thomas about what the board was up to. Cristina said it was Thomas' idea and that she was surprised too when he suddenly changed his mind. Parker thought about it and said they might even luck out because he had never seen Thomas do a procedure like this and he wouldn't allow it if Cristina wouldn't be in there to take over when Thomas craps out. He said that Thomas crapping out would be all the board needs for his dismissal. Parker left and Thomas beckoned her from the OR.\n\nIn surgery, Thomas was having trouble with the catheter but Cristina gave him tips to pull it off successfully. When it worked, Thomas got enthusiastic about the modern procedure and refused her help when she offered to finish it. In the evening, Parker joined Cristina on her way out, knowing Thomas pulled off the procedure successfully, and she told him he could look a little less disappointed. She said Thomas was a historical treasure and that that was in no way funny. He offered her to go and have sex, but she rejected him because she was meeting a friend for drinks. He said it was nice that she was making friends and wanted to continue, but she wished him a good night and walked off. At a bar, she and Craig were having a drink. Craig knew they were trying to push him out, showing her the watch they gave him at a surprise retirement party four years ago. He thought the watch was a piece of junk, but he wore it just to screw with him. He said they were all so polite and didn't dare to say anything directly. It'd been a while since he had anyone who cared enough to give him grief. Cristina ordered another drink and urged Thomas to order something that contains actual alcohol, so he ordered an old fashioned. She laughed and decided to order one too, instead of another tequila.<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n\nAs Cristina woke up on a morning, she felt miserable. Parker slept over and tried to be nice, but she brushed him off. Leaving for work, she friendly greeted her neighbor, telling Meredith on the phone that she was neighborly now. As she came outside, she found her car buried under a mountain of snow. Luckily, Dr. Thomas soon came to pick her up and he gave her a danish, accompanied with the scans of a huge aneurysm they were going to operate on together. Parker offered her to join on his cool surgery in the afternoon, but she simply stated not being available. Parker soon interfered with Thomas' case and told Cristina that even though Craig was a great old guy, there was nothing to gain by working with him. Cristina thought otherwise and walked away. Parker came to check up multiple times during the surgery, wanting to interfere when the aneurysm blew, but Thomas told him to back off. After surgery, Parker put Thomas on probation as he refused to step down gracefully and he asked Cristina to talk to Thomas. Cristina confessed to Thomas that she felt guilty over what happened, but he assured her that Parker had been after him a long time. He told her not to worry about his employment and drove her home to get a good night's sleep before the second surgery on their patient. \n\nInspired by her doomsday prepper patient, Cristina assembled her own bug-out bag, filled with tequila. As Cristina was worried that Parker wouldn't sign off on the second surgery, Thomas told her that the sex with Parker made her conventional and skittish and that he tried not to think about Parker. Cristina couldn't let it go and went to talk to Parker, asking him to let it slide and not to fire Thomas. He said that Thomas was holding her back, which she'd see once he was gone. Cristina then tried to convince Thomas to let her do the surgery with someone else, as it could be the end of him, but Thomas said he may be ready for that. Cristina shouted she couldn't work at the hospital without him, but he pointed out she wasn't going anywhere due to her fear of flying. He revealed he wanted to go down fighting for something he believes in. \n\n\nIn surgery, Cristina joked that she was his dream come true, which he affirmed. He continued to teach her and complimented her, saying she would be the surgeon of her generation. He told her people would try to diminish her, but they would fail. Suddenly, while operating, Craig froze, looked up at her and fell down. Nurses still tried to resuscitate him as Cristina continued operating, but it was too late. She continued operating with his advice in her mind. She successfully finished the surgery. As she kept thinking about his advice and compliments, she saw his body being rolled off on a gurney and she ignored Parker, who tried to reach out. While remembering that Thomas told her that none of the people at this hospital had the capacity to understand her, she got dressed and left the hospital. She took a flight to Seattle and showed up at Meredith's house, where they hugged after all the time they hadn't met. Cristina had drunk all the tequila from her bug-out bag to board the plane. Seeing each other helped them to accept both Thomas' and Lexie's death.<ref>[[Beautiful Doom]], x</ref>\n\nCristina moved back into the dream house with Meredith, who understood she needed support after her friend's death. Cristina soon met up with Owen, who showed her what he could offer her salary-wise. She thanked him, but he told her she should thank Jeff Russell, the new head of cardio who really pushed to get her. He told her there was a meeting about the plane crash lawsuit. She had to be there now, because he wasn't acting as her proxy anymore. He gave her an orientation packet and formally welcomed her to the hospital. Cristina marked her return with some mean comments towards April and her way to treat the interns. She soon met up with Jeff, who simply told her to go and have fun, see patients. He trusted her to run his service while he was dealing with his own research and surgeries. He allowed her to sign her own surgeries and only asked her to call him if she had a really cool case. She reminded him she was only a fellow, but he believed that she was as good as an attending. In the plane crash meeting, Cristina was informed they were going to talk about physical, mental or emotional difficulties that they experienced after the crash. They were informed that these harms would mean a sizable award for them, much bigger than the offered settlement. After hearing they might go after Jerry, the pilot, for the money, Cristina said she couldn't help them and left. She started naming the interns with dwarf names, making them hate her.\n\nOne of the lawyers followed her and convinced her a statement of her could benefit all of them, so she told him her shoulder hurts sometimes and that she may have had some PTSD. This made her realize she did have some things to talk about and agreed to  minutes, but she was called by a nurse for a patient emergency. She allowed her interns to scrub in with her, making them realize she was awesome instead of hate worthy. The surgery went great, with Cristina teaching the interns that it was sometimes better to do things the old fashioned way. After surgery, Owen yelled at her for having operated on Russell's patient without consulting him first, believing Russell would fire her for that. There was a little meeting with Russell and the two of them, and while waiting for Russell, Cristina told Owen he shouldn't have hired her back if he didn't want her there. Russell arrived and simply stated Cristina made a good call. Seeing what Cristina did, Russell told Owen he now knew why Owen pushed him so hard to get Cristina on staff. Cristina was surprised to hear this and Owen quickly left, feeling awkward. At the last meeting of the day, Cristina begged her lawyers to leave the pilot, who is paralyzed now, alone. After Owen was asked to step out, their lawyers told them the best strategy would be to look for a fault from this hospital itself, the people who put them on the plane: Owen. After coming home from work, Cristina realized that the firehouse didn't feel like a home anymore and packed her stuff, moving in with Alex, who bought Meredith's old house. Even though he didn't want roommates at first, she managed to convince him.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a morning meeting, Owen assured all attendings that the fact that a group of doctors filing a lawsuit against the hospital wouldn't affect their work. After everyone left, Cristina asked what he wanted to do about the firehouse, as she wasn't staying there anymore. He simply told her to do what she liked, as it was her house. During a conversation with Meredith, Cristina said she didn't want to feel like Owen's old wife, chained in the attic, but she didn't know what she wanted to be to him. Cristina met Owen to have him sign off on her surgery and she asked him why she was here, as he pushed so hard to have her back but still didn't seem to want her here. He stated she was good business, but she asked if that was the only reason. He said she moved away, asked him to stop calling, and now she's back, so he had no idea what she wanted. Neither did she, but he pointed out they don't work because they'll always end up hurting each other because they want different things. That's what they've always known and nothing changed about it. During surgery with Bailey, Cristina advised Bailey to just put on her wedding dress and get married, just like she did with Owen. After surgery, Bailey noticed how Cristina cared about the interns, even having fought Bailey to teach one, and how she cared enough about Bailey's wedding to give her good personal advice. She pointed out Cristina changed, even though Cristina didn't think so. This made her think about Owen saying nothing changed between them. She thought maybe she was the thing that changed, and she asked Meredith if she did. Meredith said she did, because she wanted Owen back. Owen came to the firehouse to talk, and just as she wanted to say she wanted to try again, he told her wanted a divorce.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn the day of Bailey's wedding, Owen informed Cristina that the lawyer put together the divorce papers, which he'd send tomorrow. Cristina pointed out it was fast, but Owen told her he asked the lawyer to be fast and asked if that was a problem for her. She said no, but seemed to feel otherwise. They agreed to be amical so they could still work together. However, during a conversation with Meredith, Cristina found out that Owen only asked for a divorce because it would benefit the doctors in the lawsuit. After a surgery together, Cristina asked him if it was true. It was, because he really wanted them to get the money and he didn't ask her first because he thought she'd reject it just because it was his idea. She asked him why he made the unilateral decision about their marriage, but he simply asked her why she didn't dare to ask for a divorce when moving across the country. She yelled that he let the plane crash make the decision for him, only to have him revealing that he feels insanely guilty because he is the one who chose the airline due to budget cuts he had to make. She assured him he wasn't at fault, but he couldn't let go of his guilt. After getting dressed for Bailey's wedding, Cristina went to Owen and asked him if the lawsuit was the only reason he asked for a divorce. He didn't know what to say, so she confessed she was going to ask him to try again when he asked for the divorce, resulting in a passionate kiss.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nThe kiss resulted in them having sex again. After making out, Cristina said that maybe, they were going to be fine. He didn't want to talk about at that moment and started kissing her, but stopped when he got paged. After having worked together all day in the ER, they sat down in a lounge with the divorce papers. She proposed they take a minute to think about what this meant, but he was done thinking about it and confessed they never should've gotten married, as they only put themselves in a box where they kept beating each other again the walls and ripping each other apart over the last two years. He said that they would get out of that box once they signed the papers, after which she took a pen and signed the papers, after which he did the same. They held hands as they both cried and kissed each other to show that they still love each other, even though their marriage ended.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nThey went from being married to being friends with benefits, with Cristina commenting to Meredith that having sex with someone who used to be your husband is way better than when you're still married. After they got a call from their lawyers, they went to the courtroom to find out they won the case and were awarded with  million dollars each. When they returned to the hospital, Cristina revealed to Derek that she figured out Meredith was pregnant, even though Meredith hadn't told her yet. She and Owen went to an [[On-Call Room|on-call room]] where they talked about the plane crash lawsuit. She asked him to come to Callie's survivor dinner that night, but he refused as Derek was still blaming him. Cristina wanted to comment on this, but he told her he just wanted to enjoy the moment of them being together and they started to undress. After the sex, Cristina went to talk to Derek and begged him to forgive Owen so they could all move past the plane crash, but Derek said it wasn't that easy. In the evening at the restaurant, Callie made her colleagues realize that they should be celebrating because they were all still alive. To make the dinner more fun, Cristina kept on sexting Owen until the others caught her. During the toast, Meredith revealed that she was pregnant and Cristina acted as surprised as the others. Derek called Owen and forgave him and asked him to come over, but Owen refused. Cristina took over the phone and asked him to come and celebrate with them, but Owen still rejected the offer, even after she told him there were bathroom doors that lock. Without the survivors knowing, Owen was informed that the hospital would have to pay the survivors, as the insurance company found a loophole and thereby wouldn't pay. This would mean that the hospital would go bankrupt and would have to close its doors.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Alana Cahill, a physician's advisor, was hired by the hospital to find a way to save some money and prevent the hospital from going bankrupt, the doctors were informed that the ER would be closed down.<ref>[[Walking on a Dream]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, cameras were installed in the CCU. There was a remote physician behind the eye to help reduce mistakes, improve patient care and maximize physician hours. Cristina felt extremely uncomfortable with the cameras, thinking they'd soon be installed everywhere (on-call rooms included), and soon started to butt heads with the remote physician. That evening, the ER was closed and Cristina comforted Owen, who was sad as there was no more trauma department in the hospital. She joined him as he went to the bar to go have a drink.<ref>[[Bad Blood]], x</ref>\n\nEverytime Owen visited the house, they had loud and hot sex, being made fun of by Alex and Jo. After it became public that the hospital could only be saved through a buyer, Alana started looking for a face to represent the hospital, Cristina was asked to, but she refused as her face only goes on the Nobel brochure. Meanwhile, Alana found a company called Pegasus that was interested in buying. Cristina helped the other doctors take care of hit-and-run victim, despite the fact that the hospital no longer was a trauma center, jeopardizing the sale to Pegasus. At the end of the day, Owen told Cristina the staff was killing him, though they both realized it was the right thing to do. They started to make out in the on-call room again while Callie informed the other survivors that a Pegasus hospital is all but positive and suggested they buy the hospital themselves.<ref>[[The Face of Change]], x</ref>\n\nWhile the others were having a meeting about Callie's suggestion at Meredith's house, Cristina and Owen were having sex, ignoring Meredith's texts. Owen gets a text from Cahill and confides in Cristina that if there's even a small group of staff that quits, Pegasus backs out. She promised him that wouldn't happen and continued making out with him. The next day at work, Meredith informed her that they were thinking about buying the hospital. Cristina laughed it and didn't understand why Meredith thought she'd be on board. Cristina said they have no idea how to run a hospital and she also told Meredith that they couldn't quit, as this would make the whole hospital go down. Even the interns started talking about looking elsewhere, but Cristina urged them to stay loyal to the hospital. Stephanie made her realize though that the interns now don't have the same things as Cristina had when she was an intern. This made Cristina agree to listen to Stan, Derek's financial adviser. He told them they needed more money than they all had combined and that they needed the hospital's financial statements if they were to continue with the plan and if they wanted a precise number of how much more money they needed. Cristina said Owen could get them, but Stan told her that Owen was legally obligated to tell Pegasus everything that could jeopardize the sale, so she should keep him completely in the dark about their plans.\n\nCristina overheard Owen promising the nurses that Pegasus was their best option. She later asked him if he really believed this, and he replied he didn't. She asked him why he was fighting so hard then. Because it's the only option, he said. As Owen got a call from Alana to inform him that Pegasus moved up the sale and that they would buy the hospital that night, Cristina realized they needed to do something, fast. As all other survivors finally agreed to buy the hospital, Cristina informed them about Pegasus' plans and told them there was only one thing they could do. They went to the conference room where Pegasus was about to buy the hospital and they all quit their jobs, making Pegasus back out. Cristina felt like she stabbed Owen in the back, but Meredith assured her Owen would understand once they could tell him, which Cristina doubted. The group of doctors went to Meredith's house, where Stan explained that they needed to form an LLC so they could legally get all their funds in one place.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\nThey found out that they would need  million dollars on top of their own money, so they started looking for an investor. They assembled a packet to convince possible investers, but Cristina didn't believe a packet would convince someone to invest so much money. She was worried this wouldn't work, because Owen stopped calling and he would never speak to her again if this whole project failed. Meredith assured her Owen would be the happiest of all once they bought the hospital and the sneaking around could stop. Alex informed them the hospital was following apart after they quit, as a lot of staff members followed their example. Cristina wanted to ease Alex's fear, but Meredith reminded her they couldn't tell anyone. They found a possible investor in [[Julian Crest]], who would love their main idea of research being very important in the hospital. After a successful meeting with his junior executives, their case was passed up to his business development guys, who wanted to see more of the financial side rather than their medical dreams only. Stan gave them a folder with that kind of information, which made one of the suits run it by Mr. Crest, who agreed to give the doctors  minutes in the afternoon before leaving for Dubai. \n\nThrough Heather Brooks, they found out that Alana managed to make a new deal with Pegasus. The company wanted to buy the hospital to liquidate its assets and lay off its staff and the hospital board would agree, as there was no other deal. As Crest was their last chance to save the staff, they were encouraged to learn everything about the financial side by heart. Crest thought they were looking for an out-right buyer, not that they actually wanted to run the place. He did his homework on them and found out that there was no manager in the bunch, no administrative leadership experience. He respected their passion and shared it, but he wasn't feeling it. He advised them to get someone with real administrative experience on their team and then they could talk again. While Meredith went to get Richard on their team, Cristina confessed everything to Owen as telling him wouldn't make any more difference now. She explained they only walked out to stall the sale to Pegasus and that they have an investor, only needing him and Webber to get the guy on board before the Pegasus deal would close. She said she didn't tell him because he could be sued or end up in jail due to the disclosure agreements he signed. She promised she was only trying to protect him, after which he went to the board to tell them about the doctors' plan so they wouldn't agree to the Pegasus deal.\n\nThe group, plus Richard, returned to Julian Crest and introduced him to the leadership he asked for. Derek and Richard flew to the airport together with Julian in his helicopter so they could talk about it again. The others drove there, only to find out from Richard and Derek that Julian said no again. After this, Cristina met Owen at Joe's. He enthusiastically told her the board decided to wait for them to present their offer, but she had to tell him Julian wasn't going to invest. This meant it was over for the hospital. They returned to Alex's house, where Alex started blaming them for what happened. Cristina finally told him they were trying to buy the hospital and that they screwed up. He got them some good booze and requested they finally started talking to him. The next morning, all doctors were called to a hotel where Catherine Avery, informed about the problems by Richard, told them that the Harper Avery Foundation would very much like to invest with them. There was only one condition: they would like a representative of their choosing to sit on the board of directors. They all happily agreed to the offer, but weren't so enthusiastic to find out Jackson was the elected representative.<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\nNeither of the doctors were happy that Jackson has a bigger say than one of them in running the hospital, but because he represents the Harper Avery Foundation, which put in the majority of the money, Jackson has the decisive vote and the right to veto theirs. Jackson was late during their first meeting and he revealed that the Foundation was still thinking about the reopening of the trauma department and that they were thinking to replace Owen as Chief of Surgery, because they were starting fresh and it'd be good for the moral. No one agreed to this and Cristina told him that this thing with Owen wouldn't happen, no matter who was giving him his marching orders. Meredith pointed out they were grateful for the Foundation's investment, but they didn't ask them to start dictating policy. Jackson replied no one asked them to sue the hospital into bankruptcy either. They reminded him they did so for the plane crash that killed Lexie and left the room.\n\nCristina went to tell Owen that Avery was talking about replacing him, but she assured him they wouldn't let that happen. She just didn't want him to hear a rumor. He was determined to fix this himself. Cristina found out that Owen quit. He told her he did so because someone was still blaming him for everything, which made him believe he couldn't be effective. The other board members weren't glad she told Owen, but she stated they've been going behind his back for long enough. During the day, Cristina contributed to creating an administrative mess to show Jackson he wasn't capable of leading a hospital. Cristina met up with Derek, whose comments about who to blame made Owen walk out, and told him he should stop blaming Owen. She didn't understand what it was about, as Derek seemingly forgave him months ago. Jackson stepped up as a leader when he managed to solve the OR crisis and find an available OR for Cristina. \n\nIn the evening, the doctors signed the documents and they officially became the board of directors. Before they could leave the room, Jackson wanted to share some things that were top priority. They agreed to listen and he told her he wanted to reinstate Owen Hunt as Chief of Surgery, to which Owen agreed. This brought him to his second point: they were reopening the ER so they would be a level  trauma center again. From now on, the Foundation would be following their lead, not the other way around. Lastly, he proposed they rename the hospital, as they were building a new hospital that stands for leading and innovation and he wanted them to remember they were a hospital run by doctors, which should mean something. He suggested a name to remember the very reason they came together and been able to do this. He turned around a paper and revealed the name \"Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital\", a name that exemplifies the spirit of the hospital but also the depth of their dedication. With every member of the board voting in favor, the hospital was officially renamed.<ref>[[Transplant Wasteland]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, a brand new ER was opened with cutting edge equipment. Owen was very pleased with this, thanking Cristina with a passionate kiss. The board also had a  hour meeting to decide on a logo for the hospital. Cristina was excited about the fact that them buying the hospital earned them an article in the magazine Surgery Today. While browsing through a magazine, she saw an article about Marcus Cho, a \"moron\" who was a year behind her at Stanford. Frustrated that other doctors were doing research while she kept on postponing research to fulfill her administrative duties, she went to look for Dr. Russell to find earth-shattering badass cardio research she could get in on. Russell overheard her saying this and was glad to hear her say that, thinking he had just the right procedure for her. He introduced her to his valve trial, allowing her to complete the procedure on her own on his patient of the day. She enthusiastically told him everything she knew about the procedure and confessed she had wanted to get in on the trial ever since she heard about it. After the procedure, she was completely impressed. He told her the results of phase  had been astounding and she asked when phase  would begin. That depended on her, he said. She thought he would allow her to do phase , but he told her it was his trial and that he didn't need another surgeon. What he needed from her was  million dollars to keep it going. She thought he was bringing her onto the trial, but understood he was only pitching her. He said it was nice to finally have someone on the board who got what he was doing.\n\nCristina ventilated her frustration to Meredith. She said that this was exactly what she was afraid of: the administrative duties were taking over her career, and now Russell saw her as someone on the board instead of as a surgeon. To give Miranda the money she needed for her genome project and to punish Russell for the way he treated her, Cristina cut Russell's budget by a few million. He shouted he asked for more and that this would mean he had to lose a resident and a research assistant. Probably two of each, she pointed out and fakely apologized. This only left him with her, determined to take over the work of those four people and do her very best at it. She would treat his patients, take his surgeries and assist in research, including projects she'd find on her own. \"Pile it on,\" she said and he started objecting he couldn't do that, but she told him the board believed he could. In the evening, she took a whole bunch of research material home with her to get through that night.<ref>[[Idle Hands]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter hot morning sex, Owen was paged to the hospital for the victims of a big accident on the highway. Cristina started treating Paul Dawson, the father of Ethan, the boy Owen took care of. Cristina had to operate on Paul and Owen soon came to check if she could give him a time frame for Ethan. As Ethan was fine but his mother had to have surgery as well, Owen spent time with Ethan to comfort him. In the evening, Owen and Cristina hung out together in an on-call room. She informed she had no idea when Paul could be transferred out of the CCU, which Owen hoped would be soon as Ethan started freaking out. He soon fell asleep and she got paged. She went to Paul's room, where Paul was arresting. She managed to revive him and induced therapeutic hypothermia, which would help to avoid another attack. Owen started caring for this family and questioned her move, asking her about Russell's approval. She reminded him he was her patient, but he went to talk to Russell about it. He agreed with Cristina's plan, though Owen suspected he may only do so because he was afraid of her, like she suspected herself. Cristina asked what was going on and he explained that Paul had a little boy of whom both parents were hospitalized. She assured him she only made the decision in the best interest of her patient and, just like him, wanted Ethan to see his dad again. He hugged her and apologized for his behavior. She proposed they get out together. He agreed, but first went to to spend time with Ethan without her knowing.<ref>[[Can't Fight This Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Paul was still unconscious and while Cristina was checking up on him, Owen came to talk to her. He told her Ethan spent the night on the peds ward to keep social services away and that Ethan's grandmother was coming today. Cristina brought up they were supposed to meet up last night and told him she wore the T-shirt that she's not allowed to wear when they're arguing because it makes him forget what his point was. He was sorry he missed it and as she said she could put it on again, Owen asked her why Paul was still out. She said he would wake up once she'd reverse the hypothermia. She reminded she said he might, or might  hours later or he might  days later. They don't have a problem until it's any more than that. Owen wanted her to talk to Russell about this, even though she assured there was no reason to. Later that day, Cristina overheard how Arizona informed Owen that Ethan's grandmother got stuck back east and that she advised him to call social services. Later that day, Meredith asked Cristina if she would take care of her kids when Meredith would start suffering from Alzheimer's, but Cristina once again made it clear that she didn't want to have kids and that she preferred to visit the kids regularly rather than raising them. She wanted to be the coolest aunt in the world, but she couldn't be a mom. Meredith later came to convince her to give her a lethal injection once she started showing the symptoms of Alzheimer's, as Derek didn't seem to want to do it.\n\nLater that day, Cristina gave Paul Dawson a bolus of D, as it might help him to wake up. Owen asked her why she didn't talk to him first. Because she talked to Russell about it like, he asked. He brought up that she knew he was concerned about the case, but she questioned if there had to be three highly-trained surgeons supervising one man's recovery. He said they work as a team at the hospital, and while she brought up she had been too busy teaching the Syrian doctors to overthink perfectly straightforward post-op care, he told her that the next morning, she would round on Paul with him and Russell. Meredith came over to Paul's room and Cristina told her Paul was going to wake up in a few days, so they could all relax about it. She told her that she Owen maybe didn't like being Chief because lately he was all about Russell not supervising her and she thought that may be because he missed teaching and that the administrative crap made him lose touch with medicine. In the evening however, she and Meredith watched Owen talk with Ethan in his room. She said this must be why he'd been acting so crazy lately. Meredith pointed out that kids make you crazy and Cristina agreed. Meredith said it looked kinda cute though, which Cristina did not like hearing.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a board meeting, Jackson told the other board members that the CDC, which was brought in to examine a post-operative infection that spread among  of Bailey's patients, asked them not to discuss the investigation with Bailey, so they had to avoid her that day. All thought it was ridiculous and they were opposed his idea to put out a statement. Meredith also asked her to be in her corner when she was giving birth, but Cristina declined because people poop on the table during childbirth. Throughout the day, Cristina teased Alex about his feelings for Jo, suggesting he punch Jason to take back his girl. Owen and Cristina ended up in an elevator together and agreed to celebrate in an on-call room after surgery. She asked him about Ethan's grandmother, who had arrived earlier that day. He told her she was sweet but useless, but that was not a problem as Rachel, Ethan's mother, was doing better. Cristina said she did neurological exams on Paul and she had a good feeling that he'd wake up soon. Owen kissed her and thanked her for the good feeling she had. He also advised her to agree to Meredith's request, as seeing a baby being born is like watching God in person. Cristina then told Meredith she would be there and hearing that Meredith would suffer more than her, as she'd know Cristina saw her poop on the table, made her feel a little bit better. She walked into Owen and she told him she was sorry about Paul's wife. He barely reacted and she asked if he was angry with her, but he was just angry at the situation. Cristina suggested they go home to relax a little, but he wanted to stay in case Paul's condition would change or Ethan would need something. He just didn't feel like he could leave and asked her what she would do. She replied she would go home because she was his doctor, not his family. He still decided to stay and she told him she understood. At the end of the day, Cristina had a meeting where Bailey was found to have spread an infection due to microtears in the gloves, which were implemented by Pegasus' protocol. The blame was all on the gloves and Bailey could return to the OR once she was infection-free, which was the best outcome, Cristina told her. That night, Alex came to talk to her and he confessed indeed loving Jo. On her turn, she confessed that she thought she was losing Owen, not today, but soon.<ref>[[Sleeping Monster]], x</ref>\n\nOn the eighth day of Paul's coma, he still hadn't woken up. Cristina didn't like that the family overheard her saying the number of eight days, as they now got their hopes up while it could also be a few days after the eighth day. She started thinking about other treatments she could have followed, but she concluded the therapeutic hypothermia was the only right one. Following his confession, Cristina helped Alex to avoid Jo. Meredith informed her Bailey had locked herself in her genome lab because she was mad at all of them for the CDC thing, which prompted Cristina to go talk to her. From outside the lab, Cristina explained the situation and without Bailey answering, Cristina came up with the idea to go global. She called several international hospitals to ask about their trials regarding waking up coma patients, but without success. The entire board later tried to apologize to Bailey, but she continued to ignore them all. When Ethan was brought in with an overdose of sleeping pills, Cristina suddenly realized that zolpidem is a gaba agonist and that they could reverse the effects. She and Owen went to Paul's room to give him zolpidem, which triggers the gaba pathway. In normal brains this causes drowsiness, but when there has ban a chemical balance disturbance, the drug can reverse the effect. They waited next to his bed for an hour, but it didn't work. Owen got angry and frustrated because a social worker was going to take Ethan away as his grandmother, who suffered from cataracts, couldn't take care of him anymore. Cristina showed up at Ethan's room and assured him that they were trying anything to wake up his father, telling him not to give up on his father. Cristina watched how Owen started comforting the crying boy and left in pain. At the end of the day, Cristina and Owen snuggled in an on-call room and she brought up he changed. She knew he still wanted a kid. He convincingly said he wanted her and kissed her passionately to shut her up, though once the kiss ended, both of their faces clearly showed that they both knew she was right.<ref>[[Do You Believe in Magic]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Cristina replied to [[Nancy Dawson|Nancy Dawson's]] questions about withdrawing care for her comatose son Paul, Owen got mad at her for having told Nancy that it was unlikely that Paul would ever wake up. This pushed Cristina to try even harder to wake up Paul, resulting in finding a small blood clot on a CT scan of Paul's head. Derek informed her that taking out the clot could wake him up, but might also kill him. He asked if the family wanted to take the risk, so Cristina went to ask Nancy, who agreed to the surgery. Derek performed most of the surgery, during which the basilar wall dissected. Derek was forced to leave Heather to finish the surgery when he had to check on Meredith. Cristina was worried about Heather finishing the surgery, but she did good. After the surgery, Derek honestly said that he thought the surgery had done more harm than good. Cristina sighed and started beating herself up over the fact that she hadn't seen the clot earlier, but Derek assured her she did what she could. However, soon after, Paul did wake up and Cristina enthusiastically went to get Owen. Instead of being happy, Owen was visibly disappointed when he saw Ethan and Paul together and ordered an immediate transfer to Seattle Pres. Cristina later talked to Meredith about Owen's disappointment and how close Owen was getting to the kid. She then heard from Meredith that Owen had been thinking about taking Ethan and that he seemed ready to do so. Cristina asked what she could do about it, but Meredith said there wasn't anything she could do.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\nCristina and Owen both were on the elevator to the rooftop with Ethan and his father, who were ready to be transferred to Seattle Pres. Cristina watched Owen take care of Ethan and once they boarded the helicopter, she asked him he could pretend this wasn't an issue. She told him again he wanted kids, but he assured her he just wanted this one kid. She said him lying to himself did not make her feel better about him lying to her, but he promised he was not lying about loving her and wanting to spend the rest of his life with her. She questioned if he would never look at her in the future and only see the things she couldn't give him. He simply asked her if she ever thought about the fact that he might now his own mind better than she did. Cristina then got paged by Meredith. Cristina went to her room and commented it was typically her to go into labor during a super storm. While Meredith was informed she needed to have a C-section, the lights died. In the complete darkness, Shane came to get Cristina as Webber needed her in his OR. Cristina only agreed if Shane took her place by Meredith's side and came to update her regularly. In the OR, Cristina found out through an ultrasound that there was a hole in the patient's heart and she had to open him up to find out where it was exactly. She initially refused, but Richard managed to convince her. Even in the dark, she managed to find to the hole in the heart with Webber's guidance by simply listening to it. \n\nAfter surgery, she thanked Richard for having made her a better doctor tonight. She left the scrub room to go check up on Meredith, only to find that Meredith was not in recovery. She went to Connie, who was already working on another patient, but she had no idea where Meredith was as she didn't know about the splenic bleed Bailey was fixing at the exact same moment. She met up with Derek and they ran to the OR, where they waited outside until Bailey finished the surgery. Derek was worrying, but Cristina listed all the things Meredith survived and concluded she would survive the surgery. Meredith indeed survived the surgery, much to their happiness.\n\nShe went to tell Owen, who wanted to go visit the Shepherd family together. She asked if he knew how much she loved him, which he did. She started talking about the joy she felt in the dark OR and that she feels like that all the time in the OR, pure joy, content. She asked if he felt like that with just her. He avoided the question, but she knew he felt that way with Ethan. He claimed she was reading way too much into it, but she told him to stop for a second and listen to his heart. He started talking about how she was the only thing he needed in his life, but she once again asked if he believed she would be enough. He couldn't reply and she apologized and said she wished it were different. He started to object, but she said it already happened. She walked out of the on-call room and even though he shouted that he said no, he didn't come after her as she left. Cristina went to Meredith's room, but upon seeing them enjoying their newborn son, she decided not to interrupt them and walked away.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a board meeting, in which Cristina's question about Dr. Boswell led to Callie outing Arizona as a cheater, Cristina laid down next to Meredith in her hospital bed. She felt like she was going to die because of the break-up and told Meredith that she ended things with Owen. Meredith thought they'd start things again as always, but Cristina assured her this time was different than the other times they broke up. She and Owen worked together again when he had to mediate between Cristina and Bailey, who differed on opinions over Richard's case. She lost from Bailey when Meredith, who turned out to be Richard's medical proxy, relied on the labs and let Bailey operate. Before Owen was going into surgery with Bailey, Cristina gave him instructions and put them in Owen's phone, even though he told her it wasn't necessary. He kindly told her she was a challenging person, which she already knew. Cristina went back to Meredith's room, where Meredith asked her to say she made the right decision. Cristina let go of her professional opinion and told Meredith she did.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith wanted her to assure her again, which Cristina did. They then waited for news on Richard and Heather. When the latter died, Cristina and Owen went to tell Stephanie. The interns got the night off to mourn Heather's death, so Cristina took over one of Stephanie's patients. While discussing the patient with Owen, he blurted out he wished he had known their last time together that it was their last time together, as he would've done things a little differently. He described their last time together, and after they agreed it wasn't their best work, they rushed off to an on-call room to have sex. When Cristina went back to Meredith's room, Meredith noticed something in Cristina's hair, which an ashamed Cristina quickly covered up. Later, while informing Owen on her patient again, he said he was glad they had given each other a better last memory. Cristina said that if they had really thought it through, the last time he mentioned hadn't been their last time. She whispered into his ear what had been, and they rushed to an on-call room again. While cuddling in bed, Cristina told Owen they couldn't stay friends as they would just continue to have sex all the time. \"Just because I am the one who said it was time, doesn't mean this is easy for me. This is not easy for me,\" she said as she started crying. After a long day of work, Cristina told Owen she was going at Meredith's house to help Callie (who moved in there) and Derek take care of the kids. Owen offered to help, but she just wished him a good night and left.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Cristina already started to miss sex. At work, Owen told her and Arizona that they, as two of the few remaining board members at work, needed to make a decision about the outpatient surgery wing, which was destroyed by the storm. During his speech, he accidentally offended Arizona, who left, leaving Cristina and Owen all alone. Cristina noticed he was stressed and wanted to comfort him, but remembered their break-up and quickly left, before something would happen between them again. Later that day, Cristina talked to Meredith about the situation with Owen, saying that nothing would change if they just kept having sex. While looking at her patient's scans with Owen, there was some romantic tension and he told her he would normally kiss her. Callie interrupted the moment by coming in to ask questions about couples therapy, but offended them both by saying couple's therapy obviously hadn't done them any good. At the end of the day, Cristina and Owen ended up in the elevator together. She told him they would eventually be drawn together again, and then proposed they both date other people. She admitted it would feel forced, but it might help them to get over each other and she made him promise to at least try it.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nAt the fundraising party that was organized to get money to repair the hospital after the super storm, Jackson informed them that % of the money would go to the department of the surgeon who'd raise the most money. Both Owen and Meredith came to complain to her, and she told them it was simple. They just had to be charming, using the same skills they'd use if they wanted to pick someone up at a bar. She knew Meredith knew how to do that, and she'd get Owen to practice if they were serious about meeting new people. She then spotted a guy which she nicknamed Richy Rich, whom she kept on complimenting and flirting with. While she was getting the guy another drink at the bar, she interrupted Owen and Emma's conversation and chased Emma away, telling Owen he wouldn't get money out of her. She advised him to go after an old lady wearing Chanel and returned to Richy Rich with a drink. Some time later, she went to get another drink for the guy. At the bar, she met Alex and told him that every drink she served the guy would mean another zero on the check he'd give her. She had so much that night, reminding her of her intern year, in which they played dirty and stole surgeries. They didn't get to do that anymore now. While treating the victim of an accident at the party, Cristina wondered if Richy Rich was watching, as they looked awesome taking care of the patient and that would mean even more money. She was paged to the hospital to operate on [[James Carlson|a tamponading junkie]].\n\nIn surgery, she called Shane a shark, as he did a pericardial window on his own in the ER. She assured him it was a good thing, as all good surgeons were sharks: you see what you want, do whatever it takes to get it, like her. She told him to never apologize, as sharks don't do that. She allowed him make the decision on how they'd continue the surgery, and he chose the risky move, which she pulled off successfully. After surgery, she met up with Richy Rich and flired with him some more to get him to give her check. Once he did, he proposed they got out of the hospital, but refused it was all about the money for her, unlike what he thought. She flirted with him all night to get him to write this big check, only for nothing in return. He asked her if she didn't even feel a little bit bad about that, which she didn't. He proposed she could sleep with him for free, but she just smiled and walked away with the check. \n\nShe met Owen on his way out of the hospital and told him she understood he didn't want to date other people, as people were gross. She said they looked great though and asked him to go to Joe's for a drink, just as Emma walked in. She came to talk to Owen, who was charmed by her. Noticing Owen's interest in Emma, Cristina said she was just heading out and left the two of them to talk. Once outside, she was seemingly disappointed that Owen managed to find someone new so fast and turned her down for his new love interest.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith and Cristina briefly fought over the fact that their lives had led them to two different places. Meredith ultimately believed that Cristina did not think Meredith could be as great a surgeon as she could because Meredith focuses on being a parent as well as a surgeon. Eventually, their fight ended.\n\n\nCristina began a trial where she used Meredith's D printer to create conduit hearts to help children. Her research led to her nomination for the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], which bought her more recognition for her trial.\n\n\nThough she was told she was the front runner by [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]], she still lost the award. Later, it was revealed that she had all the votes to win. It was the connection the hospital had with the foundation that cost her the award. It is impossible for anyone working at the hospital to win a Harper Avery Award.\n\n\nThe loss of the Harper Avery Award kept on haunting Cristina at the hospital. The other doctors wanted her to use her recent success in the medical community to appeal new surgeons and investors for the hospital. When telling [[Sabine McNeil]] that her children needed to go home in order to properly heal, she herself realized that she needed to get away from the hospital for some time to get over the loss. She told Meredith she needed a day where it was all about her trial and not about the Awards or its financial consequences for the hospital. She then followed Meredith and Owen's advice to give a lecture about her trial at another hospital, and accepted an offer to travel to Zurich. They thought she needed time to figure out what she was going to do next. After spending four days in her hotel, she fell in love with the city. During the lecture, it turned out that it had been [[Preston Burke]] who made her come to Zurich. Initially resentful given their history, she ultimately accepted his offer to scrub in with him as she had also followed his work over the years. He showed her some of his hospital's cutting edge techniques, such as holographic hearts in the OR and  -D printers.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Cristina realizes what she wants to do next.]]\nSeeing all these techniques, she suddenly realized that printing a functioning, beating human heart is what she wanted to do next. He said she could do that at his hospital, as he had an endless amount of fundings and had the material to do what she desired. After overthinking the job offer, she refused later that night, as she suspected some ploy to get her back in his life. However, he revealed he was married and had kids now. Even though he acknowledged her life had changed too and that he didn't know her anymore, he admitted she had become a magnificent surgeon and everything he dreamed she'd be, which moved her. He told her she should be in a place like this hospital and asked her to consider his offer again. That night on the phone, she told Meredith about the offer and that everything she ever wanted was in Zurich, except him being there.\n\nHowever, the next morning, before leaving, she paid him another visit and once again declined his offer. He wanted to know why, as it didn't make any sense. She told him she never wanted to work for him, she wanted to ''be'' him. Him walking away from her at the altar was the best thing that ever happened to her, as it made her stand on her own two feet. She asked why he offered her a job that he knew she couldn't resist, thinking he'd want her to chase \"the carrot\" until he'd snatch it away. He revealed he didn't want her to work for him, as that would destroy his marriage and his life. Eventually, he'd be chasing her. He repeated he did not want her to work for him, so she reminded him he just offered her a job. He then revealed he wanted her to take over from him, as he would be leaving to move with his family. She couldn't believe it at first, but it was the truth: he was seriously offering her a hospital. This place was hers if she wanted it. She then accepted the offer. She returned to Seattle, where Meredith immediately realized that Cristina accepted Burke's offer and that her person would be leaving the city.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\nBack in Seattle, Owen was supportive of her decision, but Meredith suspected he was up to something. Cristina volunteered to interview replacements for [[Jeff Russell]], her boss. None of the applicants seemed fitting, but Owen told her they couldn't all be like her. When Meredith heard about the interviews at lunch, she thought that was Owen's plan: making her meet applicants she wouldn't like so she wouldn't leave and offering her the job at the end. During the last interview, Cristina was asked about the Harper Avery Award, which was the applicant's goal. She told him he'd never win it, as the only goal of the Award's winners is to make patients better using innovative techniques. In the evening, Owen joined her to make a decision. He proposed to ask the Foundation for a large infusion of cash into the cardio department so they could attract higher category talent. Cristina hushed him and asked him not to offer her the job. He confessed he wanted to for a week, but he didn't because he knows she has to go. They both realized nothing good could come out of him asking her to stay, so he wouldn't ask her to. However, he did ask her not to leave him until she had to leave, after which they ended up kissing again.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\nAfter putting off her departure multiple times awaiting a heart for [[Lincoln McNeil]], the day finally came to leave. After drinking with Meredith, she spent one final night with Owen. She promised him they'd have a goodbye at the hospital and then left for the mall to go buy a European phone charger. However, there was an explosion at the mall before she arrived, worrying Owen. She turned out fine at the hospital, where Meredith told her about her move to D.C. and Arizona informed her that a heart had become available for Link. She scrubbed in with Alex and reminded him of how good he is, suggesting he was putting all that talent in a drawer by taking the job at the private practice. Unbeknownst to him, she had laid him an envelope on his bed, leaving him her shares of the hospital. She requested that [[Maggie Pierce]], her new boss, prep Link for her.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Meredith says goodbye to Cristina.]]\nWhile scrubbing in, Meredith joined her and Cristina explained that she needed to perform the transplant in order to feel finished. Meredith pointed out she didn't need to feel finished since she was just taking the next step in her career, and she promised she'd help Cristina leave. As the donor heart was delayed, Cristina had to leave before the surgery. She hugged Derek on her way out. As she allowed Shane to come with her per his request, she hugged and thanked Bailey and Webber. She then rushed off to wave at Owen from the gallery as he was operating. Meredith then got her in the cab just as the heart for Link arrived and told Cristina she loved her, after which the cab drove off.\n\nHowever, Cristina made a brief return as she had thought of the perfect way to say goodbye to Meredith. She dragged her to an on-call room and said they needed to dance it out one last time. Before dancing it out, they made arrangements to keep in touch and Cristina asked Meredith not to let Owen get all dark and twisty and to mock Alex once in a while. She also asked her person not to be a hero since Cristina needs her alive. Meredith makes her brave. They then danced it out. Right before leaving, Cristina finally said what had been bugging her. She told Meredith that while Derek was very dreamy, Meredith was the sun, a surgeon with an extraordinary mind, so she shouldn't let what Derek wanted eclipse what she needed. She then left for the airport and flew to Zurich.\n\nShe settled down in Burke's former office and decorated it with pictures of Meredith, Derek, and Owen. Shane came to get her for their first staff meeting.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nCristina came back to Seattle to stand with Meredith at Derek's funeral and hold her hand. Alex later reached out to her when Meredith disappeared, but Cristina hadn't seen or heard from Meredith since.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nThe night Meredith won the Harper Avery Award, Cristina called her while she was about to celebrate with Alex, just in time for the champagne. Alex and Meredith opened the bottle and Cristina asked Meredith if she felt different, to which Meredith answered she did.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Sam Bello]] was forced to leave the country because she was a dreamer, Cristina agreed to take Bello in as a surgical intern at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] and have her work under her.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after Meredith's \"Hospital From Hell\" article was published, Cristina texted Meredith encouraging her to move to Switzerland before Miranda killed her.\n\nCristina sent a letter of support for Meredith for her medical license hearing, where she stated that Meredith was the only one she would want to operate on her if she was dying, that she was the sun and was unstoppable and that she would fix the broken system.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref> As a congratulatory gift, Cristina sent [[Cormac Hayes]] to Seattle.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\n\nCristina is incredibly focused and driven (even more so than the others) and is always excited about the chance to scrub in on a surgery. Extremely competitive, she is not above stealing and hijacking patients if it means getting in on an exciting surgery. Cristina has excellent surgical skills, and is the intern with the most medical knowledge. However, she has difficulties conveying her feelings and dislikes being touched by anyone, including her mother. She also has a poor bedside manner and finds it hard to empathize with most patients.\n\nCristina values logic and practical thinking above emotional reasoning, but has undergone several emotional situations since becoming an intern. She has been described as cold, cut-throat and hardcore, which she defines as her \"edge\" and has helped her during her internship but has caused emotional problems in relationships such as with [[Preston Burke|Burke]] and [[George O'Malley|George]] who describes her as a \"robot\". Because of the traumatic experience of watching her father die, Cristina is unable to handle the emotional loss from the thought of losing her loved ones. While she initially grappled with the concept of expressing her feelings, Cristina has gradually become more comfortable with sharing her inner thoughts. Nevertheless, she is still considered the least emotional of all the interns.\n\n[[Image:OldC.jpg|thumb|left|Old Cristina.]]\nDespite her strong personality, when Meredith was unconscious after falling into the water during the ferry crisis, Cristina fled after she realized she could not deal with the fact that her \"person\" was dying. Burke encouraged her to confront her feelings, and she burst into the trauma room and insisted that the doctors try to revive Meredith again. Meredith soon woke up, and an overwhelmed Cristina happily told Meredith that she was getting married to Burke, and Meredith was the one person she wanted to tell.\n\nIzzie tells Cristina about her cancer, and asks her not to tell anyone else. Cristina pulls every favor she possibly can and sets her up with the best surgical oncologist in Washington state, but Izzie blows it off, annoying Cristina. When confronted, Izzie is apathetic about the cancer, which makes Cristina wonder why she told her. While helping Izzie, Cristina becomes increasingly distracted on the day of her solo surgery and eventually told an OR of Izzie's illness, including Bailey and Alex.\n\n\n\nWhile at Stanford Medical School, she began a romantic relationship with the renowned cardiothoracic surgeon and her professor, [[Colin Marlow]]. This relationship lasted for  years throughout her medical degree and the relationship ended as she finished medical school.\n\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Cristina after her miscarriage.]]\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\n[[Preston Burke]] gave Cristina a cup of coffee, causing her to be taken aback by the gesture. Later, touched by the fact that Burke admitted to having made a huge error in a surgery, Cristina followed Burke into the on-call room and locked the door. They proceeded to have sex. The next day, Burke tried to get Cristina to define their relationship, but a commitment-phobic Cristina brushed him off. She later found out later that she was pregnant and immediately scheduled an abortion.\n\nUnable to deal with her emotions about the pregnancy and abortion, she distanced herself from a bewildered, frustrated Burke, telling only Meredith about her pregnancy, as she was her person she had put down in case of a medical emergency. Meanwhile, her covert relationship with Burke came out into the open after [[George O'Malley|George]] saw them kissing and told Meredith and Izzie. After the Chief told Burke that he could only be interim Chief of Surgery if he was prepared to sacrifice his personal life, he decided to break up with Cristina. Although she pretended to not care, Cristina was hurt by his decision and decided against telling Burke about her pregnancy. However while in surgery with Burke, she collapsed from an ectopic pregnancy and her left fallopian tube burst.<ref>[[Make Me Lose Control]], x</ref> Burke was shocked to find out about the pregnancy, but Cristina reminded him that he broke up with her. Despite that, he was the only one whom she allowed to comfort her when she could not stop crying from her grief.\n\nThe couple reconciled and officially became a couple.<ref>[[Bring the Pain]], x</ref> When Cristina and Burke went on their first official date out of the hospital, they realized that they have almost nothing in common. Burke also noted that Cristina is \ucvery hard to get to know\ud and she agreed. Although their relationship was dysfunctional, it was still going strong as they were clearly in love with each other.\n\nAnother obstacle in her relationship with Burke was their different beliefs. Burke is moderately religious and believes in spiritual traditions, while Cristina is a strong atheist who believes only in science and openly scoffs at any superstition and spiritual ideas. When she first found out about Burke's spirituality, Cristina was shocked, believing that a surgeon with his level of ambition and medical skill wouldn't have anything but a purely scientific mind. She began looking down on Burke for beliefs she considered irrational, while Burke was hurt and angry she wouldn't accept his spirituality. This clash in belief caused tension between Cristina and Burke, but it was subsequently resolved.\n\nCristina\us commitment issues resurfaced when Burke gave her a key to his apartment and asked her to move in with him. She felt that they did not know each other well enough yet, but Burke convinced her to open up to him. Cristina introduced Burke to her extremely messy apartment and lifestyle, but Burke accepted her for what she was. She eventually agreed to move in with Burke, but secretly kept her old apartment. The truth eventually came out and Burke was mad that Cristina had lied to him. Burke later confronts her, and talks to her about how competitive and stubborn she is, while he still loves her. Cristina replied saying that she gave up her apartment twenty minutes ago.\n\nWhen George had a disastrous sexual encounter with Meredith and moved out of her place, Burke invited him to stay at his apartment. Cristina was jealous that George was able to relate better to Burke than she could, and she devised a way to make Burke kick out George himself. Insisting on her right to be comfortable in her own home, she went about naked in the apartment, and Burke was forced to evict George from their apartment.\n\nLater, Burke became mad at Cristina when she unwittingly fell asleep during sex.<ref>[[Damage Case]], x</ref> During this conflict, Burke prevented Cristina from scrubbing in on several surgeries. This outraged Cristina, who hated the fact that her love life could have such a large impact on her work life. However, this argument ended abruptly when Burke was shot in the arm. When sent to the surgery room to help Burke during his intense, painful surgery, she panicked and fled, her turbulent emotions preventing her from acting. This event would impact her deeply, for she knew it wasn't like her at all to be controlled by her emotions in such a way. Later, she eventually returned to his side and held his hand.\n\nBurke\us recovery was not smooth-sailing and he discovered that he had developed a hand tremor. Burke later confided to Cristina about his hand tremor, and she told him that no-one has to know. They devised a covert partnership to hide Burke's tremors from the other doctors. In her best supportive way, she managed Burke\us surgery schedule and scrubbed in on all his surgeries, so that she could take over whenever his hand became too tired to proceed with surgery. However, her exclusivity to rare surgeries incited jealousy and suspicion from the other interns. George subsequently witnessed one of Burke\us hand tremors, and confronted Cristina about it. She frantically denied it, but suffered a crisis of confidence and eventually confessed everything to the Chief.\n\nCristina\us actions jeopardized Burke\us chances of becoming Chief of Surgery, and Burke saw this as a huge betrayal. Both parties refused to talk to each other after the fallout, jeopardizing their relationship. Cristina eventually broke the silence, and Burke asked her to marry him. Cristina was stunned and only accepted his proposal after eight days of hesitation. However, she refused to wear the ring he gave her, saying she doesn\ut do rings.\n\nCristina's life was further complicated when her former professor and lover, Colin Marlow, arrived at Seattle Grace. In a bid to win her back, he repeatedly came onto her and tried to sabotage her relationship with Burke. On top of that, he joined the race for Chief of Surgery, so as to compete with Burke and impress her. Cristina resorted to acting extremely affectionate with Burke, after direct attempts at getting Marlow to leave Seattle Grace failed. However, Marlow was not convinced by this and used the opportunity of a rare surgery to lure Cristina to his side. Marlow humiliated Burke in the operating room by belittling Burke's knowledge of cardiothoracic surgery, and relegated Burke to just observing the surgery. After the surgery, Cristina comforted him. Unbeknownst to her, Marlow witnessed the entire thing, telling her she had compromised herself for Burke, and was no longer the competitive and driven person he fell in love with. She responded by saying that she's learned that \"sometimes you have to think about other people.\"\n\nFollowing Burke's departure at the altar, she is devastated and remains so for a long time. Matters are not helped with the new cardiothoracic surgeon, [[Erica Hahn]], hating her. [[Jane Burke|Mama Burke]] apologizes to Cristina for Burke as well, for losing him and her teacher, as she recognizes that Cristina loved being surgeon more than Burke and that is likely to be why they bonded so well.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nNot long after moving past Burke, Cristina was blown away by army surgeon [[Owen Hunt|Major Owen Hunt]], who arrived at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]] on the back of an ambulance and instantly managed to impress Cristina, having performed an emergency [[Medical Glossary#T|tracheotomy]] with a pen in the field. Noticing the bleeding gash in Major Hunt's leg, [[Richard Webber|Chief Webber]] ordered Cristina to take care of him. He then managed to impress her even further by stapling up his own leg without any kind of anesthesia. Later the same night, Cristina was impaled through the abdomen by a falling icicle outside the hospital, and Major Hunt found her and carried her inside. As he treated her, the two bonded, and she was visibly disappointed when he turned down Chief Webber's job offer and told that he was due to return to Iraq soon. Hunt left, but not before giving Cristina a passionate kiss.\n\n[[File:Crowenkiss.jpg|thumb|px|left|Cristina and Owen kiss.]]Two months later, Cristina was surprised to see Major Hunt sitting at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]], and the next day, she found out that he had been hired as the new Head of Trauma at Seattle Grace. Cristina panicked, not wanting to get involved with another attending. She tried to avoid him, which turned out to be unnecessary, as he had seemingly forgotten her name, calling her \"Cristine\". Cristina later confronted him about this, and he told her that in Iraq, his entire platoon had been killed in an attack, which was why he had decided to move on from everything that belonged in the past, including Cristina. \n\nAfter this, Cristina and Owen tried to act casually around and towards each other, but sparks were in the air. Cristina even opened up to Owen about the death of her father, an event that drove her to do surgery and be the best. After a patient special to Owen died, Cristina tried to offer him her condolences, but he got upset, first threatening Cristina, then kissing her. Cristina was startled, and the two started to avoid each other again, until one day Cristina found him sitting on the doorstep outside her building. She sat down next to him and he told her that she was beautiful. Not long after, Cristina lost the solo-surgery, so Owen took her to [[The Vents]], which cheered her up and the two kissed. \n\nThe relationship begins to blossom, with glances across rooms and stolen touches, like a Victorian romance novel, inspired by [[Ellis Grey's Journals]], but they soon hit another roadblock when Owen's ex-fianc\ue turns up at the hospital and it is revealed that Owen broke up with her in a two-line email. Owen admits to Cristina he is not proud of that, but he is a different person than he was, and he is terrified of what people would think when they see him now, especially his mother, as he is not the person they sent to war.\n\nOwen was quick to declare his feeling for Cristina after his return from the army, after the experienced had changed him. He confessed he wanted to wanted to be around in  years to \"rip the scalpel out of\" Cristina's hands after she becomes to old to practice, though they only had two failed attempted dates at that point.              \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|right|]]\n\nCristina accepts they move forward, until Owen's psychological damage from war begins to manifest itself as PTSD, first throwing Cristina into a shelf, requiring her to get stitches, and then strangling her in his sleep. Callie and Meredith take the defensive and prevent Owen from seeing her, but Cristina claims she is fine. The two have a moment and consummate their relationship, only for Cristina to break up with Owen because she is terrified of falling asleep next to him.<ref>[[Elevator Love Letter]], x</ref> Cristina was missing a cardio attending to teach her, so as a gift to her, Owen brought a new cardiothoracic surgeon to Seattle Grace, [[Teddy Altman]], a friend of his from the army. Teddy later confessed her love to Owen, which complicated Cristina and Owen's relationship a bit. \n\nThe love triangle between Owen, Cristina, and Teddy wasn't settled until the hospital was invaded by the murderous gunman [[Gary Clark]]. Owen and Teddy made it out of the hospital with a patient, but after realizing that Cristina was still inside, Owen made his decision and ran back to the hospital to find her. He then found Cristina in an OR where she was operating on Derek, who had been shot earlier, with Jackson, Meredith, and April - and with Gary Clark holding his gun against her head, ordering her to stop operating. Owen then tried to distract the gunman from Cristina, even yelling to him as he was about to shoot her: \"That is the woman that I love. You shoot her, you touch her, and I will kill you!\" The situation became even more dangerous when Meredith stood up, ordering the gunman to kill her instead of Derek. As the barrel of the gun moved to Meredith, Owen jumped towards Clark, forcing the shooter to shoot him instead of Meredith. After the gunman had gone, Cristina, not knowing the extent of his injuries, urged Meredith to save Owen. Luckily, it turned out the bullet had only pierced his shoulder, and in the wake of the disaster, Owen and Cristina got back together.\n\nAfter the shooting, Cristina suffered from PTSD and Owen took care of her, eventually proposing to her. Not long after, they got married in front of all their friends in a ceremony held at Meredith's and moved in together, purchasing an old firehouse that they decorated. Cristina later found out that she was pregnant with their child. Owen was thrilled, but Cristina, not wanting to become a mother, told him that she was going to have an abortion. Owen tried unsuccessfully to talk her out of it, and ultimately kicked her out of their home for failing to give him a voice in the matter. However, Cristina found herself unable to go through with the abortion without Owen's support, which alarmed Meredith, who, after telling him what sort of miserable future would await both Cristina and the child if she kept it, convinced Owen to let Cristina have the abortion. Owen held Cristina's hand during the procedure, but the moment seemed bittersweet and involuntary. \n\nIt soon became clear that Owen was not okay with it. He and Cristina grew apart, he became more and more distant and silent, until the situation finally exploded during Zola's birthday party. Owen and Cristina got into a huge argument which ended with Owen accusing Cristina of killing their baby. After this, the situation only grew worse, and during a session with a marriage counselor, it became clear that they both failed to understand each other's point of view on the baby issue.\n\nOwen's discomfort and anxiety eventually led him to get drunk and have a one-night stand with a patient's friend. He confessed his infidelity to Cristina, who had earlier suspected him of having an affair with nurse [[Emily Kovach|Emily]] Kovach, which completely devastated her. Owen moved out of the firehouse and Cristina started to plan to move to Minnesota and accept the fellowship offer at Mayo Clinic. However, before leaving, she slept with Owen one last time, forgiving his infidelity. \n\nAfter Cristina and the others had been rescued from the forest in the wake of the plane crash, Owen promised to take care of Cristina, who was in a psychosis. He took her to the firehouse and managed to get her to speak. After she had fully recovered, she left for Minnesota to pursue her fellowship, while Owen stayed back in Seattle to continue his role as Chief of Surgery. After Cristina's mentor, Dr. Thomas died, she returned to Seattle and tried to make efforts to reconcile with Owen. Due to a lawsuit against the plane company, Owen asked Cristina for a divorce, which would help the surgeons with their trial. Cristina then told Owen she wanted to try again and he agreed, but they still went through with the divorce for the sake of the lawsuit. Their newfound happiness was short-lived, however, as the arrival of -year-old [[Ethan Dawson]], with whom Owen bonded, made it very clear that Owen still wanted children. Cristina then realized that she would never be able to give Owen what he desires, so she left him. They later got back together for a short time after Owen broke up with [[Emma Marling|Emma]] after cheating on her with Cristina. He reassured Cristina that he did not want kids, just her, but Cristina knew that he still wanted them. Cristina broke up with Owen again as she wanted him to have kids and she could not give them to him, leaving them both devastated. When he found out that Cristina was moving to Switzerland to run a hospital there, he asked her to be with him until she had to leave.\n\n[[Darren Parker]]\nWhile in Minnesota, Cristina had sex multiple times with Dr. Parker. She never truly liked him, but she missed sex. Cristina and Meredith referred to him as her sex friend, although Cristina stopped having sex with him when she found out he had been using her to get Dr. Thomas fired. After Dr. Thomas died while operating with Cristina, Parker tried to reach out to her, but she ignored him and flew back to Seattle, resigning from the hospital. \n\n[[Shane Ross]]\nWhile working closely together with Cristina, Shane overheard her saying that she needed to be at her best at work. She initially refused when he offered to sleep with her. However, when he defended her against Meredith, with whom Cristina had a serious fight at the time, she kissed him to thank him. They continued to have sex in the on-call rooms from time to time, but this ended as soon as Shane went crazy in the OR.\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith and Cristina met in the locker room on their first day of internship after discovering they had the same resident. Their [[Katie Bryce|first case]] together was a very complex case, and they worked together to find a solution and bonded during the process, but their relationship was strained after Meredith got credit for the work they did together. Over the course of their internship and residency, they deemed themselves each other's [[Person(s)|persons]].\n\nThey had their first big fight after Richard Webber blamed Cristina for knowing about the interns' secret meetings and Meredith did not defend her. Meredith even insulted Cristina by saying that to some people things came naturally, but Cristina was one of the people that had to practice. They constantly ignored each other, until Meredith broke down over the execution of a murderer, and then they made up. They started to repair their friendship over reading diaries written by Meredith's mother, when Meredith compared Cristina to Meredith's mom, Ellis Grey.\n\nCristina was often there for Meredith during her worst times and vice versa. Meredith was the only person who knew about Cristina's pregnancy, and Cristina about Meredith's. Meredith was also one of Cristina's pillars of support when she suffered from PTSD as a result of the shooting. They leaned on each other constantly and stuck with each other no matter what.\n\nMeredith was Cristina's maid of honor during both of her weddings. When Cristina had a panic attack after Burke left her at the altar, Meredith helped her get out of her dress and hugged her, telling her it was okay.\n\nWhen Cristina was still in Seattle two weeks after accepting the position as director of cardiothoracic surgery in Switzerland, Meredith told her that she had been stalling and needed to leave. She said that she needed to finish something and that she and Meredith were not finished. Meredith got her a cab and watched Cristina leave but Cristina quickly came back to the hospital. She said they needed to dance it out one more time, which they did.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\nShe sent Cormac Hayes to Meredith as a \"gift\". Later, Cormac revealed to Meredith that Cristina had spoken of a \"twisted sister\", guessing that it was Meredith. Meredith shrugged and smiled.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nCristina and Callie were roommates. They got along very well and supported one another when they were going through hardships with Owen and Arizona.  \n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nCristina and Alex lived together for a period of time. Cristina called Alex \"evil spawn\". Alex went to Cristina for help with Jo after she was hit. Cristina left her spot and shares on the Hospital Board to Alex Karev.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nCristina and Izzie's relationship got off to a rough start after Cristina made a comment that Izzie must be the model.\n\nCristina was the first person whom Izzie told about her cancer.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nGeorge and Cristina were both residents with one another. While not as close with one another as Cristina and Meredith or George and Izzie the two considered each other close friends. The two often had their ups and downs as George was upset with Cristina following the news that she had helped Burke through all his surgeries and was willing for him to operate on her father. Eventually this cooled down and he was able to forgive her. Following George's death Cristina along with the other residents were hellbent on trying to believe that John Doe was someone else. Cristina's grief manifested in form that she tried to distract herself by sleeping with Owen. At the end though after the realization that George was dead it can be seen that she was deeply saddened at the loss of her dear friend.\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|px|Cristina and Burke in surgery.]]\nCristina is a graduate of Smith College. She earned her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, and she earned her M.D. from Stanford University, where she graduated first of her class and with a . GPA. She has an exceptional knowledge of surgery and medicine, with an expressed interest in [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]].\n\nCristina's biological father died when she was nine years old in a car accident; Cristina watched her father bleed out before help arrived, attempting to close his chest with her hands, to try and stop the bleeding. She claims that this is the reason she became a doctor and is very likely to be the motive behind her interest in cardiothoracic surgery.\n\nCristina Yang became a [[Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] at Seattle Grace after graduating from medical school. On the first day of the internship, she hit it off with [[Meredith Grey]]. Cristina soon fell out with her because she felt that Meredith was given surgeries because of [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] favoritism and her famous mother, Dr. [[Ellis Grey]]. However, Cristina apologized to Meredith and the pair soon became fast friends. Her frequent sarcastic remarks and lack of tact made it hard for people to like her, but her fellow interns gradually took to her ways and became friends with her as well.\n\nAs per [[Preston Burke|Burke's]] instruction, she went to check on his patient Denny Duquette. She was shocked to find out that Izzie had cut his [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire in order to secure him a new heart. Against her instincts, she stayed and together with Meredith and George, helped Izzie in her endeavor. Soon enough, Bailey stumbled upon their plan and banned them from surgeries until someone admitted to cutting the LVAD wire. To her own surprise, Cristina insisted on sticking together and helped prevent the truth from coming to light. When the Chief decided to interrogate each intern individually, Cristina begged to Chief to tell her how to regain her business-like focus, saying that she's become an emotional wreck, the complete opposite of who she'd once been. She asked the Chief to tell her how to avoid being emotionally-affected so that she could continue being a great surgeon, but he refused, saying that he did not want to be responsible for her becoming less human.\n\n[[File:xCristinaInPeds.jpg|thumb|left|px|Cristina in peds.]]\n\nCristina hit a rough patch in her career when [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Hahn]] replaced Burke as Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Dr. Hahn made her work through her way in the cardio program, often being very harsh at Cristina, stating that despite clearly having talent, she believed that constantly praising her abilities was of little benefit to her development as a surgeon. [[Richard Webber|The Chief]] noticed the situation after [[Freedom, Part |Cristina pulled off a procedure to prevent the cement boy from dying]]. Then, [[Rise Up|Hahn left]] and Cristina got her groove back in heart surgery. Later, it was revealed that [[In the Midnight Hour|Cristina was the solo surgery winner]] but she was revoked off the prize because of the intern problem and awarded the surgery of an amputation to Alex. She finally got the solo surgery, which was a hernia repair, but she didn't focus a lot on it, seeing as she was busy trying to set Izzie up with an [[Rebecca Swender|oncologist]].\n\nAfter news of the Mercy West and Seattle Grace merger, Cristina decided to go into [[Pediatric Surgery|peds]] to protect herself as everyone else was safe. Meredith had Derek, Alex was Bailey's new favorite, Izzie had cancer, but she had nobody. She found it hard to work in peds, unwilling to play games, and when she was asked to get a chocolate pudding, she ate the last one. However, in a surgery, she witnessed Mark and Arizona reattach an arm and she found herself impressed.\n\nCristina remained determined to specialize in cardio and was an ecstatic resident in [[Teddy Altman|Teddy Altman's]] service. After the shooting, however, during which Cristina was held at gunpoint as she operated on and saved Derek, Cristina was traumatized and found herself unable to focus on her work and perform surgery for months. Cristina quit and briefly worked as a bartender, but eventually returned, finally able to be in an OR again.\n\nFollowing the completion of her residency and [[Board Certification|board certification]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|general surgery]], Cristina took a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship at The [[Mayo Clinic]]. She was dismayed to find that [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]], one of her board examiners, whom she viewed to be incompetent and out of touch with modern medicine, was also a surgeon there. After failing to integrate into the environment there, Cristina is assigned to work with Dr. Thomas until future notice. She soon found that he's actually quite a remarkable surgeon, with many things to teach her. She started to enjoy working with him. When she found out that [[Darren Parker|Dr. Parker]] planned to force him into retirement, she defended [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]]. She [[Beautiful Doom|did a surgery]] with [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]] while he was on probation. The surgery was ultimately successful, but [[Craig Thomas|Dr. Thomas]] unfortunately died while operating. Saddened by his death, Cristina drank all the tequila from her \"Bug Out Bag\" and flew back to Seattle, where she moved into [[Meredith's House|Alex's House]], then owned by [[Alex Karev|Alex]]. She returned to work at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] and immediately worked to instill fear into the interns.\n\nWorking under the new [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Cardiothoracic Surgery, [[Jeff Russell|Dr. Jeff Russell]], Cristina has been granted more autonomy as a [[Fellow|fellow]] than her previous experience at Mayo. She was instructed to basically run the cardiothoracic department, take point on cases, and to only defer the interesting cases to him. Later, she forces Russell to rely on her for his research.\n\nShe is currently the Director of Cardiothoracic Surgery/Chief Medical Officer at [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] in Zurich, Switzerland, a job which she took over from her ex-fianc\ue [[Preston Burke]] when he decided to move to Italy with his family.\n\n\n*She was the first to call Dr. Shepherd \"[[\"Mc\" Labeling|McDreamy]].\"\n*When Cristina had her surgery for ectopic pregnancy, the OR Board said she was  and her blood type was AB+.\n*She is dyslexic. Yet, she managed to be a straight A student through college and ended up graduating top of her class at Smith College, Berkeley, and Stanford.\n*Cristina won the first solo surgery but was not allowed to perform it. It was the first solo surgery where all the attendings chose the same resident. She then chose Alex to perform it.\n*She prefers to drink coffee from the cart outside the hospital rather than the cafeteria coffee.\n*Her cooking skills are a bit questionable.\n*Cristina hates musicals.\n*She loves wine and tequila.\n*She has two earrings in her right ear at all times, but only one on the left.\n*She is the godmother to [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]], [[Zola Grey Shepherd]], and [[Derek Bailey Shepherd]].\n*When comparing Cristina to drinks, Mark called her a cheap wine. Shepherd called her a single malt scotch and Owen later agrees with this.\n*She can speak French (in the French version, she can speak Italian).<ref>[[Do You Believe in Magic]], x</ref>\n*She lost her virginity at the age of  to her Chemistry TA. He was a whole head shorter than her, but he was very smart.\n*When saving Derek's life during the shooting, Jackson suggested saying a prayer, but Cristina denied this, because \"''a prayer is completely useless right now\"''. Instead, she used Derek's usual phrase before cutting into his chest ''\"[[It's a Beautiful Night to Save Lives|It's a beautiful day to save lives. Let's have some fun]].\"''\n*She doesn't want to memorize her interns' names. In [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season four]], they got numbers (, , , and ) and in [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season nine]], they are named after the  dwarfs.\n*When Cristina transferred to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] from the [[Mayo Clinic]] to complete her [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]] [[Fellow|fellowship program]], Owen offered her an annual salary of $,.\n*She thinks neurosurgeries are boring.\n*When [[Erica Hahn]] was blackballing her from her service, Cristina considered exploring other [[Specialties|specialties]] like [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic surgery]], however, Cristina likened it to carpentry.<ref>[[Physical Attraction... Chemical Reaction]], x</ref>\n*Meredith is her health care proxy.\n*She stated she wanted to be Alex's health care proxy, but it's unknown if steps were taken to have this officially confirmed.\n*Cristina has been seen in five colors of scrubs: light blue (resident in Seattle), navy blue (attending in Seattle), dark green (attending in Minnesota), teal (in Switzerland), and light grey (alternate universe in [[If/Then]]).\n\n*She used to ride a motorcycle, but stopped doing so and started calling them donorcycles.\n*She hates texting.\n*Cristina made a very brief appearance during [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] [[She's Leaving Home|funeral]], however, it was a stand-in and not [[Sandra Oh]].\n*Her great-grandmother died of Alzheimer's.\n*Cristina is one of the \"Grey Sloan Seven\".\n*Cristina is one of the \"Seattle Grace Five\".\n*She loves OR .<ref>[[Take the Lead]], x</ref>\n*She snores.<ref>[[Bring the Pain]], x</ref>\n*Her favorite place to have sex in the hospital was the supply closet on the third floor.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n*She hates lemon cake.\n*New Year's Eve is her favorite holiday.<ref>[[Holidaze]], x</ref>\n*Likened to the bird Purple Sandpiper by a patient who loved bird watching.\n*She refers to her hands as \"tiny little geniuses\".<ref>[[Give Peace a Chance]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nCristinaYang.png\nxCristinaYang.png\nCristinaYang.png\nxCristinaYang.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Cristina-centric or are otherwise very informative about her life.\n{| width=\"%\"\n| width=\".%\" |<ul>\n<li>[[Make Me Lose Control]]</li>\n<li>[[Deny, Deny, Deny]]</li>\n<li>[[From a Whisper to a Scream]]</li>\n<li>[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]</li>\n<li>[[The Becoming]]</li>\n<li>[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]</li>\n<li>[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]</li>\n<li>[[Brave New World]]</li>\n<li>[[Life During Wartime]]</li>\n<li>[[Rise Up]]</li>\n<li>[[An Honest Mistake]]</li>\n<li>[[Stand By Me]]</li>\n<li>[[Elevator Love Letter]]</li>\n<li>[[Invasion]]</li>\n<li>[[New History]]</li>\n<li>[[Blink]]</li>\n<li>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]</li>\n<li>[[State of Love and Trust]]</li>\n<li>[[How Insensitive]]</li></ul>\n| width=\".%\" |<ul>\n<li>[[Sanctuary]]</li>\n<li>[[Death and All His Friends]]</li>\n<li>[[With You I'm Born Again]]</li>\n<li>[[Shock to the System]]</li>\n<li>[[Almost Grown]]</li>\n<li>[[These Arms of Mine]]</li>\n<li>[[That's Me Trying]]</li>\n<li>[[Adrift and at Peace]]</li>\n<li>[[Disarm]]</li>\n<li>[[If/Then]]</li>\n<li>[[Have You Seen Me Lately?]]</li>\n<li>[[Support System]]</li>\n<li>[[Flight]]</li>\n<li>[[Remember the Time]]</li>\n<li>[[Beautiful Doom]]</li>\n<li>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]</li>\n<li>[[Do You Know?]]</li>\n<li>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]</li>\n<li>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]</li></ul>\n|}\n\n\n:'''Cristina:''' You're either born simple, or you're born me.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\n----\n:'''Cristina (to [[George O'Malley|George]]):''' If you want crappy things to stop happening to you, then stop accepting crap and demand something more.<ref>[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]], x</ref>\n----\n:'''Cristina:''' Oh, screw beautiful.

However, he also had a bump on his forehead which he thought was a zit but was actually a Pott\us Puffy Tumor. He was taken in to surgery to have it drained. In surgery, the doctors noted cerebral spinal fluid, meaning that the abscess had penetrated his brain, meaning they needed to call in Dr. Shepherd. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\n\nAfter surgery, Braden was put into an isolation room because the enzyme injections had stopped working, leaving him vulnerable to infection. He woke up and was scared when he saw where he was. His parents assured him through the plastic barrier that they weren\ut leaving him and they love him. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-up, Braden's infection had cleared up. However, his T-cell count was still zero, so he had to remain in isolation.

Worried that the treatment would make Braden even sicker, Teresa withdrew consent for the gene therapy.

''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the treatment, Braden improved enough that Bailey felt comfortable discharging him. However, before she could do that, she had to inform his parents that she had gone ahead with the treatment. When she told them, they began to doubt the results. They also decided the press charges against Bailey for assault and battery. Owen and Jackson were able to assure them that the results were as she said they were, but not to drop the charges.\n\nStephanie Edwards lied and told them that she had forgotten to tell Bailey that they had withdrawn consent and it was entirely her fault.

Cristina took her to the OR for a biopsy, which revealed that she was rejecting her donor heart. They treated it with anti-rejection medication and put Ivy back on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well.

''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nWhile playing Hide and Seek with [[Braden Morris]], Frankie collapsed in a hallway. When she was found, her pulse was weak and she wasn't breathing well. She was taken into surgery to insert an LVAD and then she was put on the transplant list. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nFrankie's LVAD failed to reverse the heart damage, which left her in desperate need of a heart. One became available, but when they transplanted it, they discovered that it had been damaged during retrieval and couldn't keep her alive. When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow.

''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nLink was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and declined quickly. They attempted to put him on a Berlin Heart, but he was clotting too much. They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLink's heart pump worked well, keeping him stable as he waited for a heart transplant.

However, it came with increased risks. Helen initially rejected the idea, but ultimately agreed.\n\nIn surgery, Helen's heart stopped due to an air embolism. Instead of waiting for cardio, Derek opened her chest and aspirated the embolus before using cardiac massage to restore her heartbeat.\n\nWhen she woke up after surgery, she was surprised to see an incision on her chest.

Teddy, unable to watch as he died, appealed to the hospital. They decided to give him a medic alert bracelet and they'd treat him when he came in with an emergent condition. They sent him away with alpha blockers and got him set up in the clinic. However, as he was getting ready to leave, Teddy proposed that he marry her so he could be on her insurance. He rejected her, but she said that as a doctor, she couldn't leave him to die any more than if he were bleeding in the street. He told her it was a mistake and she'd regret it in the morning, but she said he didn't have to die because she could help. ''(\"[[Adrift and at Peace]]\")''\n\nThey got married and he was able to get on her insurance so he could have his surgery. ''(\"[[Disarm]]\")''\n\nHenry was then re-admitted to the hospital to have his surgery. Because the tumor had invaded his kidney, they'd need to remove it in surgery. In surgery, they found necrotic cyst on his pancreas, meaning he'd need to have a large portion of his pancreas removed. They went to Teddy as his emergency contact to ask her if she thought he could live with being diabetic. She was unable to answer that as she didn't know him very well, but she gave Chief Webber consent to do as he saw fit. Chief Webber wound up removing Henry's pancreas. ''(\"[[Start Me Up]]\")''\n\n\nDespite being married to Henry, because they weren't romantically involved, Teddy continued to date. While Henry was in the hospital to get tests, he met her date for the evening [[William (Golden Hour)|William]]. The two of them chatted in the waiting room while William waited for Teddy to finish her work. At the end of the night, Henry warned Teddy that William was not the kind of guy she would want to go on a date with, but she went anyway. ''(\"[[Golden Hour]]\")''\n\n\nHenry was out jogging one day when he collapsed and had to be taken to the ER. They stabilized him in the ER and ran some tests to figure out why he had collapsed. When his pain medication started to kick in, Henry confessed his love for her and said they should be together for real. When scans revealed a mass near his heart, Richard refused to let Teddy operate and she was forced to let Cristina operate instead. After his surgery, he said that he hadn't just said what he said because of the painkillers. She said it was a good story, but that's all it was and she didn't want to be with him. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\n\nHenry called Teddy one night when he was having a hypoglycemic episode. She left her date to bring him a canoli to bring his sugar back up and they bonded over her date being terrible. She continued to come over after several more terrible dates. One night, Henry lit some candles to set a romantic mood, but when Teddy arrived, she said she was just there to drop off pasta for him as her date was still going on. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\n\nTeddy's on and off boyfriend [[Andrew Perkins]] returned and asked her to go with him to Germany and work at a hospital there. Teddy talked to Henry about it, saying there were a lot of factors into her decision, one of which was him. He realized that she still saw him as a patient, so he went to Webber after hearing that he was starting a trial on diabetes and asked to be added to the trial, so he could get his own job and his own insurance. Webber was initially reluctant because of his relationship with Teddy, but after finding out that he was competing with Andrew for her affection, he agreed to evaluate him and make him first in line.\n\nTeddy told Henry that she decided to go to Germany with Andrew, which prompted him to ask for a divorce from Teddy. She agreed and implies Henry didn't need her any longer because he had his old job back and his own insurance. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\nTeddy came to say goodbye while Henry was in the hospital to have surgery to have his islet cell device inserted. However, when a plane crashed that day, she came back and said they were delaying their departure to help out. She told Henry what to say so he'd be admitted and be first in the queue to have his surgery when they started operating again. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\nHenry got a call that his surgery to implant his islet cell device was being moved up, so he came into the hospital for the surgery. They rushed his pre-op labs and prepared him for surgery. His device was placed successfully and he wasn't in pain in recovery.\n\nHenry came in for a follow up after the trial work had been transferred to Bailey. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\nWhen Bailey was doing the second round of devices, she worked out a few kinks the first set had. Because Henry was part of the first round, she said they needed to do daily checks of his blood sugar because there was a risk he could become diabetic again. Despite this, he was optimistic that they'd figure it out and that's why it's called a trial. ''(\"[[Put Me In, Coach]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Teddy and Henry moved into a new place, they decided to throw a dinner party, to which they invited Callie and Arizona, Bailey and Eli, and Owen and Cristina. Cristina and Eli ended up not attending. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] went up against [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] in a softball game, Teddy begged Owen to let her pitch, trying to get Henry, a former pro baseball player, to back her up. Owen, hearing that he had been a pro ball player, hired Henry temporarily as an administrative assistant so that he could play on their team. He helped Owen decide where to put the players.\n\nHowever, during the game, Henry noticed that all the doctors were pretty terrible at softball. After the game, he thanked them for bringing him on to play, even if he didn't actually help them much. ''(\"[[Put Me In, Coach]]\")''\n\n\nHenry came to the hospital to watch Teddy operate. He observed several surgeries and had a good time. At the end of the day, he confessed to Teddy that he wanted to go to medical school. She was not receptive to that idea. However, when she went home to make up with him, she found him coughing up blood. ''(\"[[Heart-Shaped Box]]\")''\n\n\nTeddy took Henry to the ER. He had a [[Computed Tomography|CT]], which revealed a tumor near his heart, causing bleeding in his lungs and trachea. Richard was planning to operate by opening his chest, but Teddy wanted it done with a bronchoscope. She wanted Cristina to do it. Cristina wasn't informed of the patient's identity (she was told he was a \"-year-old male\") until after the surgery. (\"[[Dark Was the Night]]\")\n\nCristina explained to Teddy how initially she planned to remove the tumor using a broncoscope and a laser, but as there was too much bleeding, Dr. Webber (who was standing by) had to open him up. When he opened him up, they saw that the tumor had eroded the pulmonary artery and there was too much damage. Dr. Webber and Cristina used extraordinary measures, but his heart could not tolerate the excessive bleeding. He did not survive the surgery. ''(\"[[Suddenly]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nHenry met Teddy in an elevator at the hospital and asked her how he looked, as he was going to propose to his girlfriend. She told him his girlfriend would be a fool to say no. She did say no, which Henry told Teddy about when they ran into each other again. She took interest in his case and learned he wanted to marry his girlfriend in order to get insurance, as his own maxed out. Teddy then suggested she marry him, as she had a great insurance. ''(\"[[Adrift and at Peace]]\")''\n\nThey got married by a justice of the peace with [[Owen Hunt]] as the witness. After a long day at work, Teddy met him at [[Emerald City Bar]]. They toasted their marriage and she gave him the paperwork to get him insured. ''(\"[[Disarm]]\")''\n\nAs his emergency contact and next of kin, Teddy was called in to make a decision during his surgery. She later said it made her uncomfortable to make those kinds of decisions for him, but he told her he didn't have anyone else. ''(\"[[Start Me Up]]\")''\n\nWhen Henry collapsed while jogging, Teddy was visibly worried about him. While he was on painkillers, he confessed that he wanted to be with her for real. When tests revealed a mass near his heart, she wanted to operate but because they were married, she wasn't allowed to and had to step aside while Cristina did his surgery. After his surgery, he maintained that he meant what he said, but she said she didn't feel the same way. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\nThey continued to hang out, but strictly as friends. When Henry heard that Richard was doing a trial for diabetic patients, he went to plead his case to be a participant, saying Teddy still saw him as a patient and he wanted to be able to get a job and get his own insurance so she wouldn't see him like that anymore. However, after he learned that Teddy was going to move to Germany, he asked her for a divorce. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\nAfter a day of dealing with telling multiple families that their loved ones had died in the plane crash, Teddy came into Henry's room and made him stand up so she could kiss him and tell him she was falling in love with him. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\nWhen Henry's islet cell surgery was moved up, Teddy worried about it and wondered if there was some reason the surgery was happening sooner. She continued to pester Webber about it until she was informed that she was acting like a wife. After his surgery, Teddy admitted what she'd done and said she'd be a mess every time Henry had to have surgery. ''(\"[[She's Gone]]\")''\n\nWhen he later died during a tumor resection, she was devastated and forced Cristina to follow her into surgeries and explain in detail what had gone wrong. ''(\"[[This Magic Moment]]\")''\n\nGirlfriend\nWhen he first met Teddy, Henry had a cater waiter girlfriend. He asked her to marry him for her insurance, but she declined. Henry understood her, because his primary reason to ask her was her insurance, although he stated that he genuinely liked her. ''(\"[[Adrift and at Peace]]\")''\n\n\nHenry lost his parents four and five years before meeting Teddy. He has one sister who lives in Prague, which he said was a long story. He says when they talk, he errs on the side of asking about her kids because she's broke and his health condition is exhausting. ''(\"[[Start Me Up]]\")''\n\n\nBecause of his condition, which always made him the new guy who was always sick, it was difficult for Henry to make any friends at all. He had one best friend, but his friend's wife made it pretty clear how annoying Henry was because of his illness, so Henry stopped seeing his best friend. ''(\"[[Start Me Up]]\")''\n\n\nHe was once a professional baseball player. ''(\"[[Golden Hour]]\")''\n\nAfter his baseball career ended, he held several different jobs as he had to change jobs often as he reached his health insurance maximums quickly due to his tumor condition. One of the jobs he held was as a shipping clerk. ''(\"[[Put Me In, Coach]]\")''\n\nHe was briefly hired as an administrative assistant at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] in order to make him eligible to play for their softball team in a game against [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]].

''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nStill in full rejection, Ivy was kept in isolation. While Frankie was in surgery to receive a heart transplant, Ivy declined, bumping up her status to A. When a second heart was found to replace the one that failed for Frankie, it was instead redirected to Ivy. The transplant was successful and she was recovering well.

One became available, but when they transplanted it, they discovered that it had been damaged during retrieval and couldn't keep her alive. When a second heart became available, Arizona and Alex went to retrieve it personally while Frankie was kept on bypass in the hospital. While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow.

They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLink's heart pump worked well, keeping him stable as he waited for a heart transplant.

Cristina also asked her if she could take the wedding presents, which Jane obliged, and left Cristina with the idea that they are not so different, and that if Jane had been born a generation later, she possibly would have become a woman like Cristina.

Not knowing that Meredith was actually fired, he let her take over the care over his patient until Bailey walked by and noticed what Meredith was doing. She took over care and she and Meredith instructed Logan to grab the biggest needle he could find.\ua''(\"[[Free Falling]]\")''\n\n\nLogan was part of the group of interns who failed to do a physical exam on Ruth Bennet after she complained of stomach pain, missing that she had appendicitis.

She is the biological child of [[Ellis Grey]] and [[Richard Webber]] and thus half-sister to [[Meredith Grey]]. She is married to [[Winston Ndugu]].\n\n\n\nMaggie is very driven and finished both high school and medical school faster than normal. She worked extremely hard and was a focused student. She states that she graduated early from Yale, but it is unknown whether this was in reference to undergrad or medical school.\ua\n\n\nMaggie interviewed for the position of head of cardiothoracic surgery at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She was hired soon after. Her flight to Seattle from Boston was one of the worst flying experiences ever. Due to some technical issue, the plane stayed on the tarmac and the passengers had to remain in their seats. It was very hot on the plane and they were not allowed to use the restroom or given any water. Eventually, after four hours, the flight was just cancelled with no apology whatsoever.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x </ref>\n\nTwo weeks after being hired, Maggie told [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] that she was adopted, and that  years prior, she looked for her birth mom and needed to go to the court for the records. She found out that she was dead, but got her name, and discovered that she was an amazing surgeon that worked at the [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], now [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], Maggie's current workplace. She stated that that's not why she took the job, but it's \"a little bit\" why she took the interview. When Richard asked Maggie what her mother's name was, she said that it was [[Ellis Grey]].<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nMaggie quickly began to integrate into the hospital, getting to know everyone, and how things work. However, she butted heads with [[Meredith Grey]] over a case. This came to a head when Maggie told Meredith that Ellis Grey is her birth mom.<ref>[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]], x</ref>\n\n\nDerek and Meredith decided to have Maggie come over to their house for dinner, to get to know Maggie better. After Maggie said yes, Derek thought it was a good idea to ask Richard as well. Richard at first thought it was a bad idea because Maggie was going and he didn't want to ruin it, because Maggie and Richard were not okay. The night of the dinner, Maggie and Richard showed up, but no one opened the door. She talked to Richard for a few minutes, making it clear to him that he's not her dad, and then left.<ref>[[Don't Let's Start]], x</ref>\n\n\nMeredith ended up in a bind with no one to watch her kids, so Maggie offered to watch them.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n\n\nIn the ER, Maggie treated a patient with what looked like Alzheimer's. While trying to get the patient stabilized, he accidentally hit Maggie on her cheek and eye, causing her to fall. Later, Richard asked Maggie if she was okay and Maggie responded that she was, but then said she thought she had a concussion. Maggie later complained about the patient to Richard Webber, who then revealed that her mother, Ellis Grey, had Alzheimer's.<ref>[[Don't Dream It's Over]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Maggie finds out about Derek's death.]]Maggie was one of the first people to find out about Derek's death as she was present when Meredith returned to Grey Sloan to announce his death. She presumably attended Derek's funeral. Shortly after, Meredith disappeared with her kids without leaving other than a small note saying she and the kids were fine. Over the year that Meredith was gone, Maggie continued to bond with her colleagues, especially Alex and confessed to him that she felt abandoned by Meredith, now that they finally got to be somewhat of a family. They celebrated the holidays with other colleagues. She became a little closer to Richard when she invited him for Christmas, as he appeared to be a little lonely. She also defended him when Catherine stated he was too romantic for her. Maggie said that being romantic probably made him feel good about himself. When Meredith finally returned, she hung with Maggie and Alex while they informed her about the past year.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile Maggie and her colleagues were busy dealing with\ua[[Keith Gardner]]\uaafter a tunnel collapse, Maggie got a phone call from her mother, who informed her that her parents were getting a divorce. Maggie was emotional about this, but she didn't want to bother her colleagues about it.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Meredith bought her house back from Alex, she invited Maggie and Amelia to move in with her. They assisted Meredith in caring for her kids. Maggie also often mediated between Meredith and Amelia, who frequently got into fights over little things. She often helped with Meredith's three kids, with each \"sister\" in charge of getting one kid ready for the day.\n\n\nAfter a short conversation and a few drinks, Maggie ends up making out with Andrew and sleeps with him. After that night, Maggie and Andrew agree that it was a one-time thing only that day, but only to have sex again minutes after agreeing. Shortly after, Maggie and Andrew went public with their relationship. Andrew became uncomfortable with dating an attending and started avoiding Maggie. After she confronted him, they broke up.\n\n\nHer mother came to the hospital to visit Maggie and see Jackson to get rid of a rash, which turned out to be inflammatory breast cancer. Diane and Jackson were gonna tell Maggie before Diane left, but they got into a fight and never got to talk about the cancer. A few months later, when Diane returned to have surgery, Maggie kept thinking that her mother was getting breast implants and failed to understand why continuously trying to talk her mother out of it. When Diane later told Maggie the truth about her breast cancer, Maggie immediately started looking at her charts. Over the next few months, Maggie helped her mom through everything and stated her opinion about what she should do, which her mother followed. After Maggie butted heads with Meredith, Diane fired her from her mother's case. Maggie found a clinical trial and signed her mom up for it, although the trial did more harm than good.\n\nAfter she stated that she wasn't ready for her mom to go, Meredith told her to listen to her mom and record her voice in her mind. The next day, Maggie was talking to her mom and painting her nails. Diane gave her advice including to have some fun in her life and to be a little lazy or slutty and to make a mistake. When Maggie went to open a window, she came back to find that her mom had died. Later on, she was seen hugging her mom's lifeless body with Meredith and Amelia in the room. Her dad came in and she hugged him.\n\n\nMaggie bonded with Jackson after her mother's death. They frequently talked at work and they were together when the explosion caused a fire at the hospital. Jackson rushed off to go find Stephanie, which worried Maggie. She later confronted him about it in front of April, who later pointed out that she felt like Maggie liked Jackson and that he liked her back, which she recognized. Maggie was unsure how she felt about that as she hadn't thought about Jackson in that way until April suggested it.\n\nAwkwardness ensued in her talks with Jackson as she was constantly walking on eggshells in order not to give him signals. He picked up on her weird behavior and she later came clean about what had transpired between her and April. While initially brushing it off, it also made Jackson look at Maggie in another way. Both were in for a cold shower when Catherine, after a family dinner with Richard and Jackson that Maggie attended, referred to Maggie as Jackson's sister.\n\nEventually, they did start dating. Their relationship progressed, and Maggie became more integrated into Jackson's family. They soon exchanged 'I love you's' and, months later, decided to move in together. Maggie was able to help Jackson through Catherine's tumor surgery, as Maggie had been through a similar situation with her own mother's illness.\n\n\nMaggie decided to chase after Jackson. She eventually heard him responding to her calls right when [[Victoria Hughes]] arrived with her aid car. She instructed Maggie to wait out on the street while she helped Jackson out of his predicament with [[Mari Prishna]] and [[Jai Prishna]]. Maggie then got on the ambulance with Jai and Jackson. After they arrived at the hospital, Jai was taken into the ER. Maggie and Jackson sat in the rig in silence and eventually agreed to talk about their fight when their temper had settled. He approached her after a week to inform her that Mari and Jai were doing fine. She was happy about that, but she was still angry at him for abandoning her in the car in the woods, while he just thought of it as \"taking a walk.\" She decided she was still too angry to talk and left.\n\nA week later, she joined Jackson as he was trying to figure out why Jai had had an apparent stroke. He brought up Mari hanging onto him for hours, nearly losing her arm in the process, which led to him on life support after excruciating surgeries due to something being irreparably broken inside him. He was wondering if Mari should have let go back at that cliff. Maggie understood he was using them as a metaphor for their broken relationship and that he thought it was time to let go. She agreed. The break-up stuck as she wanted someone who didn't abandon her over and over again. While she thought they would go back to being friends, she found him pretty defensive when she inquired about him and Vic after she saw them together. He told her they were just friends, but added it was none of her business. She agreed, since they apparently didn't like each other enough to even be friends.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShe and Amelia went to collect some of Maggie's stuff from Jackson's penthouse. After Maggie told her she had to tell Link about her pregnancy, Amelia showed her Jackson had posted a photo on social media with #Freedom in the caption. Maggie hated how he was sending her a message through Instagram. In the hospital parking lot, a scooter crashed into her car. Maggie and Owen took [[Reid Kim]], the driver, to a trauma room. En route there, they ran into Jackson and she made a mean comment about his freedom now that he was dating a firefighter instead of an intellectually challenging woman. Meanwhile, Reid was diagnosed with a few broken ribs. They told him he was lucky and he told Maggie she was, too, since she ran into him. She denied as she was standing still when he crashed into her car, after which he deteriorated. It was discovered he had a cardiac tamponade. They relieved the tamponade and managed to resuscitate him after extensive efforts. He made it through surgery and Maggie briefed Reid's girlfriend Tara in the ICU. Tara openly wondered why she was staying with someone who treated her as terribly as Reid did. Maggie drew parallels from her relationship with Jackson and guessed that things were good in the beginning, but then she noticed some red flags, which she ignored because dating is hard, especially for successful women. She advised Tara to leave Reid before he left her because that could leave her feeling like a victim, which she thought was so much worse than ripping that Band-Aid off herself. Afterward, she ran into Jackson, who told her she was wrong about Vic. She apologized for her comment but pointed out he had been spiteful with his caption, even if he hadn't meant to be.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nThe break-up continued to be hard on her as she kept having dreams about Jackson with Victoria thrown in the mix, too. She hated how he walked out of the fog with a new girlfriend like she never existed. Amelia informed her she and Link were keeping the baby. Amelia had trouble with keeping the secret as it clashed with her rigorous honesty but Maggie told her that privacy and honesty weren't mutually exclusive. While her experiences with love had led her to believe love wasn't worth it due to all the heartbreak, loss, back-stabbing, and pettiness, witnessing the reunion between [[Bertram Hollister]] and [[Soyoung Oh]] showed her what true love looked like. On her way home, she ran into Vic, who told her she didn't want things to be awkward. Maggie admitted she felt Jackson had moved on a little too fast to her liking and proceeded to unsuccessfully assure Vic that things weren't awkward at all.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith's article was inadvertently turned into an attack on Grey Sloan, Bailey was worried that the stress of the article's fall-out was getting to her heart. Maggie did a full cardiac work-up, which revealed her heart was fine. Given her hot flashes and mood swings, Maggie suggested it might be hormonal and drew blood for a full panel. Meanwhile, Maggie, Teddy, and Link tried to save a patient who was hit by a stowaway whose frozen body had fallen out of a plane but they failed given the extensive injuries. After the surgery, she got Bailey's results and went to tell her that, while she was indeed perimenopausal as suspected, she was also pregnant.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref> After an extensive surgery made her feel more than she'd ever felt during her relationship with Jackson, Maggie found comfort in the realization that surgery was her truest love, which she thought might never change. She joined Meredith and Amelia while they were waiting for updates on Zola's shunt revision.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Maggie got the kids ready for school while Meredith was in jail for the hours of community service she had missed. After school, the kids came to the hospital but Zola refused to go to daycare because it was for little children. Since Maggie had surgery, she convinced Andrew to watch her and assured him it'd be easy with Zola just reading her book or sitting in the OR gallery. Maggie later took the kids trick-or-treating and helped them sort the candy afterward.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Catherine returned to Seattle after a long absence, she ran into Maggie and asked how things were going at the hospital. During their conversation, Maggie learned that Jackson hadn't told her about their breakup yet. She went to confront him about that but their bickering on the matter was interrupted by the arrival of [[Sabrina Webber]], whom Maggie noticed had an uncanny resemblance to her. Maggie approached her and heard they were looking for Richard. Maggie introduced herself to Sabrina and her father [[Chris Webber]] and learned they were her cousin\uaand uncle. They knew about Maggie, who offered to drive them to Pac-North to see Richard. En route, she learned Chris and Sabi knew a lot about her and Sabi addressed the uncanny resemblance between them, which she proved by taking a picture of the two of them together. Chris commented on her lack of knowledge about them was due to Richard's being ashamed of them, though Sabi disagreed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Maggie tries to convince Sabi that she is the best to operate on her.]]\nAt Pac-North, they met up with Richard, who hadn't seen his family in five years. Sabi declined a tour and showed Maggie and Richard a picture of the massive cardiac tumor she had been diagnosed with back home. Maggie did a quick exam and decided they needed scans to get an updated view of the tumor. They exchanged phone numbers while waiting for the scan and learned they had a lot in common, like their love for crossword puzzles. While Sabi was in the scanner, Richard told her he hadn't told her about his family because they believed he thought he was better than them and he wanted to protect her from that. The scans then revealed the tumor had grown considerably and infiltrated its surrounding tissues.\n\nMaggie presented Sabi and Chris with the facts and offered to operate today but Sabi had reservations about being operated on by her family. Maggie stated she was the best and she wasn't sure the family rule applied since they had only known each other for two hours. Chris then pointed out she just steamrolled all of Sabi's concerns without listening, which he thought she inherited from Richard. Maggie disagreed and said her concerns were just not valid. Richard didn't have her back and said he'd page the on-call cardio surgeon. Maggie was upset with him for that and he explained this experience could lead to her growing closer with Sabi, which could all be jeopardized if something went wrong in that OR. Maggie pointed out Sabi came here for help from a doctor and she thought it was a shame Richard couldn't think like one. However, she did agree to consult with the cardio surgeon. However, while Maggie was out getting coffee, Sabi started crashing. Maggie rushed back to the room. Since the surgery was now urgent, Richard convinced Chris to consent to letting Maggie operate. The surgery went well until Sabi started clotting. The perfusionist hadn't informed her that Sabi's clotting time had stopped rising, as Pac-North's protocol was for the surgeon to ask, despite being given multiple doses of heparin. Maggie then realized Sabi was heparin-resistant. Maggie rushed to replace the bypass. Alex found her working frantically to save Sabi's life and concluded it was too late; Sabi was already brain dead. She stepped back and Alex called time of death. While on her way to talk to Chris and Richard, she saw a text from Richard and the picture of her and Sabi. She started to break down and Alex took her into a supply closet so she could get it all out. She composed herself and then informed Sabi's family. Chris yelled at her for operating on Sabi against Sabi's wishes, after which he stormed off. Richard and Catherine left to take Chris to go say goodbye to Sabi, leaving a broken down Maggie behind.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie accompanied Meredith, Andrew, Alex, and Amelia to a hotel for Meredith's hearing before the medical board, though she retreated to the hotel bar rather than attend the hearing. She got drunk and started explaining how Sabi died to a bartender. Jackson found her in the bar. He had heard about Sabi's death from his mother. Maggie told him she was afraid Richard would never speak to him again, which she couldn't blame him for. Jackson decided to take her home she could continue drinking there. At the house, Jackson told her he suspected Richard and Catherine were having issues but she didn't know anything about that. They then received word that Meredith got to keep her license. She realized she hadn't helped at all though he pointed out a drunk testimony wouldn't have helped. They laughed and he confessed he had missed talking to her about their lives. They nearly kissed until he backed off, saying he couldn't do it. Maggie then threw him out at the exact moment Meredith came home. Meredith asked what happened and Maggie replied she hated someone she used to love.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie and Meredith returned to work on the same day. Her first case back was [[Elliott Calhoun]], who needed an aortic valve replacement. Maggie was surprised to learn Elliott's wife [[Finley Calhoun|Finley]] had given birth to their son prematurely, adding to the pressure of the case. Maggie asked Teddy to scrub in with her. While Teddy wondered why Maggie needed help on such an easy procedure, she gladly accepted to operate on non-traumatized hearts again. During the surgery, Maggie continuously asked about the activated clotting time. Teddy brought up Owen had offered her to come run Cardio at Pac-North but Maggie scolded her for chit-chatting. Shortly before the procedure was done, Tom complimented Teddy's technique from the gallery. Maggie wondered why Teddy wasn't telling him he didn't have a future with her. Teddy was then paged away to the ER, leaving Maggie to take Elliott off bypass by herself. She did so but the heart didn't restart, causing her to panic. Teddy was brought back in and she found Maggie pondering what she did wrong. Teddy suggested they were faced with hibernating myocardium given the fact that Elliott had been on bypass multiple times. Teddy recommended they keep Elliott in the OR for a few hours as his heart would most likely restart. Since Maggie wasn't feeling like telling his family that he had died, she agreed. Maggie went to inform Finley, who didn't quite understand. Maggie couldn't handle it and left. She ran into Tom and resigned. He tried to convince her not to but she said she had lost faith in her abilities and couldn't do her job without that. After watching Elliott from the gallery, Maggie went home.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie spent her day sleeping on the couch. Andrew came by after work to inform her that Elliott's heart had indeed restarted. Maggie was relieved to hear that and Andrew asked her for advice on his problem with Meredith. Maggie pointed out he had hurt a woman who had been hurt more than enough for a lifetime. Her short-lived happiness was cut short when a woman dropped by to serve her with a lawsuit. She found out Chris was suing her for Sabrina's wrongful death.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie continued to shut everyone out. Eventually, Richard came by the house. He wanted to take her out to eat but seeing her made him realize it was better for them to eat in. While looking for things he could cook for her, Maggie told him she didn't deserve compassion from him. Richard disagreed and offered to let her talk to Pac-North's new psychologist, which led her to freak out. She realized she was being awful and requested to be left alone. Richard ignored her and said they'd start with coffee. Over coffee, he asked her why she quit since she was Sabi's only shot. He explained he couldn't look at her after Sabi's death not because of what she did but because of what he had done to her. He had sent her in there knowing Sabi was unlikely to survive. Maggie told him Sabi had died because she forgot to ask about the clotting time, which made her think she didn't belong in the OR. She asked him to leave. He left but much to her surprise, he returned soon after with food. He started to make pancakes for her and she begged him to yell at her, knowing he had lost more than she had. Richard told her about one of the few lessons his mother taught him before her death: talking problems out over pancakes. Over pancakes, Richard admitted had wondered about what he could have done differently. Maggie took all the blame but Richard says being imperfect meant she was human. She admitted no one had ever had to tell her that before. He advised her to let her insurance settle with Chris so he would get the sense that something came from Sabi's death. Richard told her quitting now meant quitting on all the lives only she could save, which he knew Sabi wouldn't want. Maggie wished she had known Sabi better. Richard offered to let her ask all the questions about Sabi she wanted since he felt like talking about his niece.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\n\nMaggie is open-hearted, optimistic and she believes in everybody and wants them to be their best.\uaShe describes herself as a big control freak, resulting in a great professional drive and her being unable to leave things unfinished. She is also described as perky and chatty, often putting her in awkward situations when she's not up to date on other people's personal life.\n\n\n\nDean\nShe was dating a man named Dean who loved to cuddle. But since she can't sleep with someone lying next to her, she would sneak out after he fell asleep and spend the night on the couch before returning in the morning before he woke up. He eventually proposed and she explained the sleeping to him, telling him he could sleep in a room down the hall. He didn't want a woman who didn't sleep in the same room as him. He is now married to a woman who loves cuddling.<ref>[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ethan Boyd]]\nShe also dated a radiologist named Ethan shortly after arriving at Grey Sloan Memorial. He pursued her with compliments, but Maggie played hard to get. They were hot and heavy for six months until she got bored and let it fizzle out.\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]]\nMaggie ends up making out and sleeping with intern [[Andrew DeLuca]] after a short conversation and a couple of drinks at Joe's.<ref>[[I Choose You]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie freaks out the next day, and in an office in the hospital, they have a conversation about last night and agree it was a one-time thing. They shake on it before they once again start kissing and proceed to undress.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after they went public, Andrew became uncomfortable with the way things changed when people knew he was seeing an attending and he started to avoid her. When she confronted him, he broke up with Maggie.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nMaggie had a crush on Nathan, and later she asked him out, but on Meredith's request, he declined.\n\n[[Clive Johnson]]\nMaggie matched with Clive on Tinder. They set up a date that\uaMaggie forgot about. Clive showed up at her work to pick her up.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\uaThey kept going on dates, one of which she left early because she forgot about her dancing class with Richard.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith and Amelia wanted to meet Clive, so Maggie decided to host a game night. Clive's wife showed up. Maggie was devastated that she was seeing a married guy. This caused\uathem to break up.\uaJackson told Clive to forget Maggie's address and to never call her again.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\nAfter Maggie broke up with Clive, Jackson came by the house after he himself broke up with his new girlfriend Priya. He then confessed he had been thinking about Maggie every time instead of Priya. He knew Maggie found their situation too complicated, but he professed his affection for her anyway. They then ended up kissing.<ref>[[Games People Play]], x</ref>\n\nJackson asked Maggie out, but she denied,\uasaying\uashe needed to focus on her surgery. Later, she paged Jackson for a consult, though he\uawas hoping it was about the dinner. After work, Maggie saw Jackson at the bar. She wanted to leave but decided to stay. They talked and Jackson asked her out to dinner again and she agreed.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Maggie and Jackson were making out in the closet, they decided to have dinner at his place instead. As they opened the door sharing one last kiss, Richard and Catherine were both staring at them. Maggie awkwardly walked away and Jackson closed the door in embarrassment. Maggie told Meredith that she felt like a teenager. Jackson fixed things with his mother and Richard and Maggie was glad that they weren't an obstacle in\uatheir relationship.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhen April was having her crisis of faith, she kissed Jackson. Maggie found out about this and was upset\uathat Jackson didn't tell her.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref> She wanted Jackson to apologize but he didn't know what he did wrong. Later, she showed up at Jackson's house and they made up and had sex.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nWhen they both received invitations for Jo's and Alex's wedding, they decided to go together as a couple.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nJackson and Maggie broke up shortly after they went camping.\n\n[[Winston Ndugu]]\nWinston was one of her residents at [[Tufts Medical Center|Tufts]]. She felt elated around him except when they were in the OR. He also had a crush on her but was too nervous to admit it because she was younger than him, but his chief resident. He was going to ask her out when he became an attending but she moved to Seattle. They met at a conference in California and instantly hit it off. They got to know each other in the short time they had. When the conference was over, he came up to Maggie and proposed either him moving to Seattle or her moving to Boston. Maggie told him she was the kind of person who needed time to make big decisions like that, and he told her to take the time she needed.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> When the Covid- pandemic started, Winston and Maggie would talk over the phone until Winston moved to Seattle to be with Maggie. Winston was granted permission to operate at Grey Sloan, but he still had a job at Tufts Medical Center. Maggie told him she was willing to move back to Boston to be with him, but he said they both knew she wouldn't. Later that same day, Winston proposed and Maggie said yes.  \n\nParents\nShe describes her parents as good, funny, kind, and goofy. She says her parents don't understand what she does or why she likes doing it. About two years after she started working at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], her mother confessed to her that she'd been having an affair with their car serviceman for eleven years and they had only stayed together for her sake, but were getting a divorce now that she was out on her own.\ua\n\nGrandparents\nAll her grandparents are still living.\n\nShe has a grandmother who refers to her vagina as \"lady place\" and is not shy about talking about it.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\nMaggie never met her birth mother, but  years prior to joining the\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] staff, she looked for her birth mother and found out that she was dead, but got her name. After learning that Maggie is her half-sister, Meredith gave Maggie Ellis' journals, so Maggie could get an idea of what Ellis was like.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nMaggie met her birth father unknowingly when she arrived at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Maggie quickly bonded with Webber while they worked together. She admired his skill greatly. When he eventually tried to tell her that he's her biological father, she became upset with him for having not told her right away.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMaggie and her maternal half-sister Meredith didn't get along at first because Meredith thought she had come to Seattle looking for money or to profit from Ellis's reputation. They fought over little things and about patients. Derek planned a family dinner for himself, Meredith, Maggie, and Richard to smooth things over but he and Meredith ended up having sex in the shower and missing the dinner, hurting Maggie's feelings.<ref>[[Don't Let's Start]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith confronted her about it, she told Meredith that the reason she was sad about the dinner being canceled was that she was excited to talk to people and eat food that wasn't from a packet and socialize. Meredith then invited Maggie to Ellis's old house to socialize with Callie and Alex.<ref>[[Could We Start Again, Please?]], x</ref> \n\nOver time, Maggie and Meredith grew closer and now they have a good  relationship.\n\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nAlthough having no legal or blood relation to Amelia, Maggie considers herself Amelia's sister (through Meredith). Amelia reciprocates this as Amelia was comfortable enough to speak to Maggie about race. Despite appreciating Amelia's sincerity, she advised Amelia to check her white privilege and to not treat her as the spokeswoman for all black people.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Amelia shut\uaLink out, Maggie tried to bring her breakfast, but Amelia refused, saying she wanted to be alone. She reminded Maggie of the space they'd given her after Sabi, and Maggie reluctantly agreed. However, she came back, saying that she was an only child and therefore needed independent space to solve her problems, but Amelia grew up in a wolf pack, and wolves only go off on their own to die. She sat down by Amelia and listened to her talk about her worries about Link and the baby. Later that night, when Link tried to visit Amelia, Maggie lied for Amelia until Amelia came downstairs herself.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nCristina and Maggie first met when Cristina interviewed Maggie for the head of cardio position at GSM. Despite feeling that Maggie was very young to do the job, she told Owen that she was qualified to do it.\n\nOnce she was officially hired, Maggie became frustrated because Cristina didn't respect her as her new boss. On Cristina's last day, she scheduled a pediatric heart transplant (for [[Lincoln McNeil|Link McNeil]]) amidst the chaos of the explosion at the mall, much to Maggie's confusion and frustration. Cristina even treated her as a resident by not listening to her objections and practically forcing her to prepare Link for the surgery. Maggie ultimately did the transplant herself as Cristina had to leave to catch her flight.\n\n\nPierce is the current [[Attending#Department Head|Co-Head]] of [[Cardiothoracic Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] with [[Teddy Altman]].\n\nShe finished high school, college, and [[Medical School|med school]] early. After med school, she began and subsequently completed a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Tufts Medical Center]]. At twenty-five, she began her [[Fellow|cardiothoracic surgery fellowship]]. Some time after, she was promoted to head the cardiothoracic surgical department.\n\nTwo years later, Pierce applied for the Head of Cardio position at Grey Sloan Memorial and succeeded [[Jeff Russell]] as the new department head. Despite having submitted her notice of resignation very early in her tenure for personal reasons, she was convinced to remain at her post by [[Derek Shepherd]].\n\nShe quit her job when losing [[Sabrina Webber]] caused her to lose faith in her own abilities, which she deemed necessary for her job. She was then made an offer by [[Richard Webber]] to come run the Cardio department at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]]. She accepted the offer but the hospital was purchased by the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]] and closed down on her first day. Like all other staff, she had to interview for a job at Grey Sloan with [[Tom Koracick]] and ended up hired as Co-Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, sharing the job with Teddy, who had been hired to replace Maggie after she quit.\n\n\n*Maggie finished high school and medical school early.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n*The writers stated they knew about Maggie's existence since the very beginning and wanted to introduce the character ever since season , but chose to introduce Thatcher's other children first; afterward, it never felt like the right time until Cristina left, creating a hole in Meredith's life. This also led Shonda to claim that there have been indirect references to Maggie over the course of the series. This is especially evident in [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season ]] as [[Only Mama Knows]] features numerous flashbacks from that season.\n*According to her mother, she started reading at the age of two.\n*There's nothing Maggie doesn't eat.\n*Growing up, Maggie was bullied because she was younger and smaller than the other kids, and because of her lisp.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n*On Twitter, Shonda Rhimes revealed she thought a lot about making Ellis and Richard's love child a son. She even looked for an actor but decided to settle for Kelly McCreary's acting talents, as the actor's great acting skills were more important to her than the actor's sex.\n*Her start date at Grey Sloan Memorial was December , .<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n*Her base rate salary is $,.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n*Her employee ID number is .<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n*Her work email address is mpierce@greysloan.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n*Maggie is very accomplished for her age: despite being five years younger than [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], Maggie had already been a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardio]] [[Attending#Department Head|head]] for two years prior to her employment at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], [[Board Certification|board-certified]], and a [[Fellow of the American College of Surgeons]].\n*She can't sleep if anyone else is in the bed with her.<ref>[[The Bed's Too Big Without You]], x</ref>\n*She was a girl scout.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n*She was registered with a babysitting service as a teen.<ref>[[All I Could Do Was Cry]], x</ref>\n*She had a full genetic history done when she was .

My childhood home is sold. My mother is in Hawaii making soups now. I\uI have no home. It's like I-I flew to this planet on an exploratory mission, and the earth blew up behind me and I can't go back. And now I'm here with you aliens.

When it became available around Christmas, his mother told him Santa brought him a new heart, but Justin flatly rejected it, saying he should give it to someone else. Despite his objections, he received the heart transplant. During the surgery, Burke asked Cristina to call for a psych consult, but she wasn't able to get one because psych was very busy because of the holidays. Burke said his mom needed to find someone for Justin to talk to.\n\nMarian called in [[Father Michael]]. Before he arrived, Justin woke up from his surgery and said his mother had claimed that the last two Christmases could be his last.\n\nFather Michael came and Justin said he knew that Santa wasn't real and there's no such thing as God and another kid had to die to give him his new heart. While talking to them, Justin coded. Cristina was able to get him back, but they said he needed to decide to live or he would die.\n\nCristina talked to Justin about her not believing in God or Santa. She believes in medicine, which she says is so much cooler than Santa. She said he should fight to live so that the can grow up and figure out a way to do heart transplants without someone having to die. Or grow up and have kids and raise them not to believe in Santa. She said dying wasn't the best revenge for him.\n\nAfter speaking to Cristina, Justin's condition rapidly improved.\n\n\n\nShe has one son, Justin.

I wasn't the brightest. But I was the best. I practiced.|'''Preston Burke'''}}\n\n'''Preston Burke''' is a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]]. He was formerly [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], but quit after leaving his fianc\uee, [[Cristina Yang]], during their wedding. After winning a Harper Avery, he founded the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]], and ran it until he gave it to Cristina.\n\n\n\nPreston grew up in Alabama, where his mother owns a restaurant.\n\nBefore going to his high school prom, he was very nervous because he didn't know how to dance. He asked his uncle, who is good at dancing, to help him. His uncle agreed and taught him a few basic moves. He stayed up nights before the prom practicing his dance moves because he wanted to impress his date. On the night of the prom, it all worked out and he didn't step on his date's feet while dancing and she said that he was a wonderful dancer.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\n\nHe completed his pre-medical studies at [[Tulane University]] where he pledged Kappa Alpha Psi and went on to graduate first in his class from [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]]. While in college, he met [[Erica Hahn]], who graduated in second place after him, beginning a rivalry between them.\n\n\nWhen he was at Mercy West fighting for a heart for Denny, he rushed to the hospital to help Denny right away. Then he got shot in the shoulder before entering the hospital. The wound caused damage to the nerves in his arm and caused him to develop a tremor. He took a long time recovering, but he eventually regained use of his arm and hand and he was able to operate again.\n\n\nPreston was in the mood for a traditional, spirited wedding, which rose conflict with Cristina. In the end, they agreed to have a spirited wedding, but only a small one. The news of the wedding was supposed to be secret, but Mark overheard Preston telling Derek, and soon everyone knew.\n\n\nAfter the wedding, Burke was nowhere to be found. When Cristina asked Derek about him, he told her Burke had handed in a letter of resignation two weeks ago.\n\n\nPreston Burke was one of the  and  applicants for the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. He was against many applicants, such as [[Erica Hahn]]. He won following his departure from Seattle Grace.\n\n\nFollowing his [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery]] win, Preston Burke sought out his next challenge. Connecting with a billionaire investor, Preston founded the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] in Zurich, Switzerland with a focus on cardiac research. As its [[Chief of Staff|chief medical officer]], Preston managed and worked in the institute for some time until he gave it to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] in order for him to move to Milan, Italy at the request of his wife.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\n\nHe is a brilliant surgeon, however, he is sometimes overbearing, especially when it came to his relationship with [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]. He is extremely neat and organized, particularly when it comes to [[Burke's Old Apartment|his apartment]], which is spotless. He is an excellent cook and plays the trumpet. \n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nAt the mixer before the interns' first day, Cristina approached Burke but he ignored her and was too interested in his date.\n\nHe began a relationship with intern [[Cristina Yang]] but broke it off because he feared it would ruin both of their reputations. However, her miscarriage brought them back together. They lived together in his perfectly-kept apartment. However, after being shot he started to have tremors and they were forced to keep them secret putting a strain on their relationship. After a long time of keeping his tremors a secret, Cristina went to the Chief and confessed everything. Initially, he was engaged in a cold war with Cristina, where neither of them spoke but after she broke the silence, he proposed to her and she accepted.\n\nHowever, on the day of their wedding, Burke told Cristina that he no longer wished to make her do anything against her will, and Burke realized he was trying to make Cristina the woman he wanted her to be rather than accepting her as the woman she is. Cristina said she \"thought this was what she wanted.\" He wanted her to say she ''knew'' it was what she wanted, so he left her in the chapel. Cristina then returned to their apartment and discovered Burke had left, taking with him the things that meant something to only him (his trumpet, his Eugene Foote collection, his grandmother's picture, and his lucky scrub cap), leaving Cristina devastated. He told Derek to inform her he quit and sent his mother to collect his things.\n\nYears later, despite having moved on and created a family, Burke evidently still had feelings for Cristina, knowing full-well if he were to work with Cristina again, he would inevitably fall for her again to the point of cheating on his wife  with Cristina and ultimately \"destroy [his] marriage and [his] life\".\n\n[[Edra Burke]]\nBurke is currently married to Edra Burke, with whom he has two children: Simone and Vivianna. Edra has sacrificed her career for their family so Burke could run the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]], but in , Burke gave his job to Cristina so he and Edra could move to Milan in order to be closer to her parents.\n\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nAlthough Burke initially disliked George, he began to like him and later, George became ''his guy''. George even moved in with him for a while but was kicked out when Cristina walked around naked. Burke was friendly towards Derek for a while but he wasn't ''friends'' with him. He even befriended Addison first. After a bomb scare at the hospital they became good friends. He even chose Derek to be his best man. He was good friends with Richard Webber as well.\n\n\nDr. Preston Burke used to be the [[Attending#Department Head|head]] [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] on a salary of $ million. After completing pre-medical studies at [[Tulane University]], Burke graduated first in his class from [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]]. He completed his [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\nHe was once the interim [[Chief of Surgery|chief of surgery]] while Dr. Webber was healing from brain surgery.\n\nHe was once shot, affecting his control of his right hand. His temporary fix to this possibly long-term problem was to work together with Cristina during every one of his surgeries so that she could take over in case he might have trouble with his hand. The arrangement fell apart after Cristina, reacting to growing stress after George caught onto their secret, went to the Chief and confessed everything. The chief was quite angry at Burke telling him that many patients are at risk and it is a major problem that his hands are not able to function perfectly. The chief referred to Burke's hands as being worth  million dollars.\n\nUntil their secret was revealed, Burke was set to become the next Chief of Surgery, but now he has to compete with his fellow attendings for the position. He recovered full use of his hand after being operated on by [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]].\n\n[[Image:Preston-burke-wins-award.jpg|left|thumb|px|Burke wins a Harper Avery.]]\n\nAfter he left Cristina at the altar, Preston's long-time rival, [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Erica Hahn]], replaced him as the head of cardiothoracic surgery. She has some respect for Burke, but was infuriated when he won a [[Catherine Fox Award|medical award]] instead of her.\n\nFollowing his [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery]] win, Preston, with the help of a billionaire investor, founded the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] in Zurich, Switzerland with a focus on cardiac research.

Additionally, he was planned to perform a Whipple.

While they were gone, Ivy declined rapidly, bumping up her status. Cristina made the decision to redirect the second heart to Ivy, who was more stable and had a better chance of survival, while she attempted a total artificial heart on Frankie. That procedure was unsuccessful and Frankie was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nAfter Frankie's funeral, Sabine snapped at an orderly who tried to take Frankie's pillow. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting in Frankie\us room while the doctors talked to his parents, Link started to cough up pink fluid just as Frankie had. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nLink was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and declined quickly. They attempted to put him on a Berlin Heart, but he was clotting too much. They put him on ECMO and he stabilized. However, after  days on ECMO, he began clotting even with heparin. Owen was able to convince the FDA to give compassionate release to use a drug-eluting heart pump to buy Link more time to wait for a heart transplant. The device was implanted successfully and they said they'd wait  hours and start to wake him up. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\nLink's heart pump worked well, keeping him stable as he waited for a heart transplant. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nLink was later discharged and allowed to wait for a heart transplant at home. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\nA heart became available for Link during the aftermath of the explosion at the Mall of the Woods. Despite this, they had Link come in to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] for his transplant. The transplant was successful. ''(\"[[Fear (of the Unknown)]]\")''\n\n\nA few weeks after Link's heart transplant, [[Maggie Pierce]], who was looking into genetic causes of cardiomyopathy for another patient, discovered what had caused the McNeil kids' cardiomyopathy. A mutation called RAF  had been discovered to cause cardiomyopathy only a week before and all three McNeil children had that mutation. Sabine was relieved that it wasn't something in their house or something she had done.

When the stress of their three kids being in the hospital started to get to them, they fought, Jon walked out, and Sabine wondered if it would destroy their marriage. However, Jon came back, saying that he had fallen asleep in the car and his phone had died. He apologized and they made up.\n\n\nSabine has three kids, who have all been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy.\n\n\n[[Teresa Morris]]\nWhile their kids were hospitalized, Sabine and Teresa bonded over questioning whether or not to trust the doctors to save their children.\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nBoth Sabine and Jon grew to know and trust Cristina Yang while their children were hospitalized.

In order to relieve the pressure in her chest and to improve her quality of life, Mrs. Drake was admitted to Seattle Grace under the care of Dr. John Davies, an attending cardiothoracic surgeon, and his surgical fellow at the time, [[Preston Burke|Dr. Preston Burke]].\n\nDuring the operation, Dr. Davies performed a left upper lobectomy on Mrs. Drake lungs. After Dr. Davies finished, Dr. Burke finished by performing the close. Unfortunately, Dr. Burke had erroneously left a surgical towel within Mrs. Drake's thoracic cavity. The incident went unreported as Dr. Burke feared that it would cause irreparable damage to his cardiothoracic surgical career.\n\nSoon after, Mrs. Drake overcame her habit and quit smoking cold-turkey. However, in the next five years, she still suffered discomfort and had to resign from her restaurant job.\n\n\nMrs. Drake returned to Seattle Grace Hospital five years later to surgically relieve the pressure in her lungs. She was assigned to [[Resident|resident surgeons]] [[Miranda Bailey]] and [[George O'Malley]], who was a [[Internship|surgical intern]] at the time, and [[Attending|attending surgeon]] and [[Chief of Surgery]] [[Richard Webber]].\n\nAfter a chest x-ray, Mrs. Drake was diagnosed with hyper-inflated lungs caused by, what they thought, was bullae. Dr. Webber noted this was her second visit and advised both Dr. Bailey and Dr. O'Malley to refrain from the anti-smoking lecture. However, during Mrs. Drake pre-operative prep, Dr. O'Malley mentioned to her that it would have been a good idea to stop smoking. Mrs. Drake then informed Dr. O'Malley that she did indeed quit, but the discomfort continued. It was this conversation that Mrs. Drake became fond of Dr. O'Malley.\n\nDuring her laprascopic procedure, both Dr. Webber and Dr. Bailey discovered the surgical towel in an attempt to cut the bullae, and immediately converted to an open thoracotomy to extract the towel. Once removed, Dr. Webber assumed that the towel came from her initial surgery at Seattle Grace. Dr. Webber soon tasked Dr. Bailey to spearhead the investigation as to how this could have occurred, while he had the conversation with Mrs. Drake regarding her post-operative condition.\n\nDr. Bailey assigned fellow surgical intern [[Cristina Yang]] to look into the post-operative reports to identify the doctors involved with the initial surgery. Given Mrs. Drake fondness of Dr. O'Malley, Dr. Bailey assigned him to pacify Mrs. Drake to mitigate the potential lawsuit. Dr. Yang soon discovered that Dr. Burke was the surgical fellow assigned to the case at the time and had performed the closing procedure.

She is married to [[Owen Hunt]], whom she met in the military. They are raising their daughter [[Allison Hunt]] and son [[Leo Hunt]] together. She is the widow of [[Henry Burton]] and a mentor to [[Cristina Yang]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n\n\nNot much is known about Teddy's childhood prior to her medical education. Teddy attended med school at [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School]] and completed her [[Resident|residency]] in [[General Surgery]] at the [[George Washington University Medical Center]] and a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] at the [[Mayo Clinic]].\n\n\nShortly after graduating, she took a job at [[Columbia University Medical Center]]. During her first year as an attending, [[Allison Robin Brown]] almost rode her bike into her as Teddy was crossing the street and stopped on the bike lane to look at her map. Given the stress she was under at her job, she lashed out and yelled at Allison. Despite hating her, Allison bought her a bagel to apologize, which got Teddy to calm down. They then got to talking and instantly liked one another. Soon after, Teddy moved in with Allison and her cardiovascular surgeon girlfriend [[Claire (Love of My Life)|Claire]]. \n[[File:xTeddyMotherDeath.png|thumb|px|Teddy learns of her mother's death.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy and Allison have an affair.]]\nIn late  and early , Teddy lost her father and mother, respectively. Around that time, she developed an affair with Allison behind Claire's back, taking advantage of every time Claire was paged to the hospital.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy and Claire find out Allison died.]]\n\nOn the eve of September , , Allison lied about having an early lay-out meeting the next day. Claire was then paged to the hospital. After she had left, Allison invited Teddy to have breakfast at Windows on the World together. They ended up having sex again. Allison had her tell the story of how they met. Teddy said she couldn't keep sneaking around and lying to their best friend. Allison then decided to tell Claire tomorrow because she loved Teddy more than she did Claire. However, the next day, on /, Allison died in the second tower. Teddy learned the news while working at the hospital, where she and Claire comforted one another as they realized Allison was gone. Unable to live in New York without Allison and having decided to keep the affair a secret, Teddy enlisted for the Army even though she had mostly been a socialist up until then. On some level, she wanted to support the soldiers that were out there getting revenge for Allison's death.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nShe went to Afghanistan, where she met [[Owen Hunt]], who saved her from a grief so huge she probably would have let it kill her. While she found him buttoned-up and couldn't stand his optimism, she was in awe of his brilliance and decisiveness. He didn't tell her how to grieve or try and fix her. They became best friends and she fell in love with him. She felt guilty for loving him half as much as Allison, guilty because he was with someone else, and guilty because she wasn't capable of letting someone love her fully. While Allison loved her, she also loved Claire. At the time, she thought love couldn't be divided between two people.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref><ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nBy , Teddy was working in Iraq with\ua[[Owen Hunt]],\ua[[Nathan Riggs]], and\ua[[Megan Hunt]]. They were all friends while Teddy was secretly in love with Owen, even though he was engaged to [[Beth Whitman]]. While Megan was also dismissive of her brother's relationship, Teddy kept her feelings a secret because she couldn't bear the thought of possibly losing him on top of all the other losses she had had to endure.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x; [[Everyday Angel]], x</ref> [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy works on a wounded soldier.]]\n\nUpon finding out about Nathan and Megan's engagement, Teddy was immediately suspicious because she recognized the necklace Nathan had used to propose as belonging to Felicia Phillips. The doctors were called out to treat several wounded soldiers after two of their Iraqi allies went rogue. As she and Nathan operated on a soldier, Teddy confronted him about her suspicions and he admitted he had cheated on Megan. She advised him to tell Megan as she would probably forgive him, noting that their love was strong. She then went to confront Owen after Megan told her that he had tanked her stratification ranking, leading Teddy to rant about how terrible it was to have to stand by and watch people live the life that you want, hinting at her jealousy over Owen and Beth's relationship. Later that evening, Teddy's patient told her that Megan's patient was the second shooter, while the doctors had previously been told that said woman was trying to wrestle the gun out of the supposed second shooter's hand. Teddy then rushed out of the tent to stop Megan from leaving with the woman on an evacuation helicopter, but she came too late and could only watch the helicopter fly off.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, Megan was kidnapped by her patient. Megan's disappearance drove a wedge between Nathan and Owen, with both blaming the other for the part they had played in Megan's disappearance.\n\nTeddy and Owen continued to serve in Iraq. One day, they were winning a soccer game when a helicopter brought in several patients. While they were improvising as they were low on supplies, an order from the Command came in for them to move back to the base. Teddy had to ride the Medevac with a couple of patients. Owen offered to trade places since she hates helicopters, but she declined and took off. Meanwhile, Owen and the rest of her platoon were driving to the base and found themselves unable to reach the base because of a storm. They ended up in an ambush, with Owen being the sole survivor. Teddy got on a helicopter when they realized something had gone wrong. Eventually, they found Owen in the desert, surrounded by his dead colleagues.<ref>[[Suicide is Painless]], x</ref>\n\nIn total, Teddy served three years in Baghdad and another two years in Landstuhl.\n\n\nOwen Hunt convinced Teddy to come work in Seattle, saying it was a great hospital with a great staff and equipment. She accepted and started work not too long after the merger. She got introduced to Jackson and Cristina, who was disappointed with a cardio goddess she'd never heard of. Owen then took Teddy to meet the Chief. Cristina later confronted her about nothing showing on Google about her, so Teddy informed Cristina about her education herself. Teddy then started cheering when it started to rain because of her long time in the desert. Later in the cath lab, she tried to teach Cristina, but she was already way ahead because she was used to the modern equipment, unlike Teddy. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Owen introduces Teddy to some colleagues.]]\nOver lunch with Arizona, Callie, and Mark, Teddy discovered that Owen brought her in as a present to his girlfriend Cristina and decided she'd enjoy the ways he was going to make it up to her. She finally managed to impress Cristina when she quickly diagnosed a kid with cardiac asthma. In surgery, she allowed Cristina to first assist and finally found something to teach her. Teddy displayed confidence in Cristina as she allowed her to fix a complication and then continued to guide her through the procedure. At the end of the day, Owen apologized for not telling her about Cristina. Teddy asked when he broke up with Beth and confessed she had always thought that he would call her when things with Beth ended and that she made up this entire story between them in her head. However, since he was with Cristina, she said she could now finally let that story go.<ref>[[New History]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy shares a look with Owen.]] Over the holidays, Teddy had a case with Cristina and Jackson as her residents that required them to wait for a heart for their patient. Meanwhile, Teddy declined to talk to Owen about what she had confessed earlier. The tension between them continued through Christmas, when Teddy was invited to the dinner at Meredith's. On New Year Eve's, Owen found himself staring at Teddy and couldn't keep it in any longer. He dragged her to a private room and expressed anger over her admitting her feelings. She wondered why as it clearly never mattered. He says it did and confessed he had felt the same way about her but never expressed those feelings because he never got any indication that she loved him, too. They almost shared a kiss until he stated he loved Cristina and left.<ref>[[Holidaze]], x</ref>\n\nSoon, Teddy allowed Cristina to perform her first solo valve replacement. Cristina practiced and guided the patient. In the OR, Cristina had difficulties locating a bleeding while Teddy refused to help. Cristina started panicking as she didn't know which option to choose to stop the bleeding. Owen, having observed from the gallery, came down to yell at Teddy as he was suspecting she wasn't helping Cristina because of her involvement with him. Teddy remained confident that Cristina would fix the problem and she did. Teddy later told Owen that Cristina needs to be pushed and that she would've stepped in if necessary. He knew, but he also needed to hear there was nothing else going on there. She didn't know what to say to him, but then decided it would be better for them if she left Seattle. Cristina found out and chased Teddy, desperately trying to find out what her new mentor needed in order to stay. Teddy confessed she wanted Owen and in the heat of the moment, Cristina blurted out that she could have him.<ref>[[Blink]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Teddy showed up to work as Richard asked her to finish out her contract. She and Cristina agreed to forget what was said. They shared a case where Teddy decided not to remove their singer patient's entire lung, but instead try to save part of it with chemo therapy. Her decision led Cristina to realize that Teddy understood Cristina's choice to choose surgery over a guy, and Cristina again requested to learn from Teddy. Teddy later met up with Owen at Joe's and she got drunk. She told him that Beth once told her she'd stop teaching to raise kids, which made Teddy realize she wasn't right for Owen as he needs someone with ambition. Then there was Cristina, the complete opposite, and Teddy told him that Cristina was willing to trade him for her. Owen then went home to tell Cristina that their relationship mattered as well as her career.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy attempts to talk to Owen.]] The day after, Teddy tried to talk to Owen about what she had said, but he refused to. She also refused to put Cristina on her service as she wanted to give the other residents a chance. However, when her patient was in critical condition in the OR, Teddy asked to have Cristina paged as she needed a skilled second set of hands. Cristina ignored the page per Owen's request as they were making out, leading to Teddy allowing Jackson to scrub in. After the surgery, she confronted Cristina about her answering her page and that she had expected they could at least keep things professional. Owen took the blame. Surprised to have him talk to her again, Teddy told them to forget about it.<ref>[[State of Love and Trust]], x</ref>\n\nThe tension between them resulted in Teddy blurting out a train of facts about her recent personal life when she and Owen were scrubbing in together. She said that he used to be her best friend whom she could tell everything to, and now he wouldn't even look at her. Owen said that happened because she confessed her feelings for him. She reminded him he did the same and then chose Cristina. Owen pointed out she chose Cristina, too, and said that he felt like he was cheating on Cristina every time he talked to her. However, he did admit he also missed his best friend. Teddy later caught up with Cristina and Owen and said she knew she talked about her feelings for Owen, but she decided to try like hell to unring the bell as she missed her best friend more than anything. She said she'd be fine as she had an amazing job with a great student to teach and a beautiful new cottage to live in. She then asked Cristina to scrub in with her.<ref>[[Valentine's Day Massacre]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Arizona befriends Teddy.]] Teddy continued to work with Cristina and they gradually became friends. However, Teddy continued to have a strained relationship with Owen while her feelings lingered. Arizona noticed her staring and decided they were going to be friends as she liked to fix things. She then invited Teddy to girls' night. Owen also later invited her to grab a beer, but she declined and headed out for girls night on the baseball field.<ref>[[Perfect Little Accident]], x</ref>\n\nA misunderstanding with Mark over breast implants led to Callie and Arizona suggesting to Mark and Teddy, respectively, that they should date. Arizona told Teddy that Mark was like candy, enjoy it and forget about it, while Callie had convinced Mark that Teddy was the serious thing he was looking for. This led to conflicting expectations so Teddy backed out. She sympathized with a patient's girlfriend who acted a little crazy upon thinking she loved her boyfriend more than he did her. Teddy then reconsidered and told Mark she was willing to go to dinner, but he said they would go to lunch in broad daylight so they could get to know each other, as he was now only interested in building a future with someone.<ref>[[Push]], x</ref>\n\nThe date went well and they got to know each other better. Teddy requested Owen as the required second physician when her patient requested physician-assisted suicide, but Owen made it clear he considered it killing the patient and declined. Teddy considered it an act of mercy and sought out Mark for his opinion. Teddy found out that Owen went to Chief Shepherd about the case behind her back and confronted him about this, but he just walked off. Derek had Teddy perform all the tests again so the hospital was covered. Owen barged in right before it happened and wondered why Kim wouldn't want to stick around in case they'd find a cure soon. Kim stated that clinging onto hope only made her feel lonely and that she wasn't afraid of death, wondering why he was. Teddy later witnessed Kim's death and then went to Mark's place for comfort and sex.<ref>[[Suicide is Painless]], x</ref>\n\nThey both considered the sex mind-blowing. Teddy came to realize that Kim's case triggered Owen's PTSD and despite her wanting to help, she opted against it since she was seeing Mark and since Cristina was already trying to help Owen. In surgery, Teddy discussed not having kids because of residency and the Army, but stated that she was now waiting for the right guy. Cristina then accidentally made a bullet explode inside their patient's chest, angering an already grumpy Owen even more. Teddy cautiously defended Cristina and took to fixing the damage. While scrubbing out, Teddy told Cristina that Owen had had it much worse than her and even she couldn't talk about what she's been through at any time, so she understood his not being able to talk about what was going on inside him. She said his triggers possibly could never go away, but she asked Cristina to give Owen time because it was very clear to Teddy how much he loved her. She also advised Cristina to just talk to Owen about how she felt as that would be more effective to get him to go to therapy than plainly telling him to do so. A second night of sex with Mark was interrupted when [[Sloan Riley|his pregnant daughter]] showed up in labor.<ref>[[Sympathy for the Parents]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy safely delivered the baby. The next day at work, she was thrown for a loop when famous cardiothoracic surgeon [[Thomas Evans]] came to the hospital for a procedure. Teddy then went to ask Derek if Tom was interviewing for her job since she had been waiting to hear from him about a permanent contract. Derek thought she was still looking elsewhere but promised to consider her for the position. While Cristina was amazed by Tom, Teddy didn't share the sentiment. Tensions between Teddy and Derek flared up when the latter explicitly stated you give people jobs because they have the right skills and not because they're family, and when Teddy made a patient's condition worse by sneezing as they were pulling a fish hook out of their patient's body. After the surgery, Derek told Teddy not to take it personally if she didn't end up getting the job as Tom just had published more and had won more awards, ignoring Teddy's bronze star for service to her country. Teddy was distraught over losing her job and Owen comforted her, which almost resulted in a kiss until they got paged about their patient being critical. Teddy thought her repair didn't hold and convinced Derek to open the patient back up despite him being unstable, only for Lexie to discover that he was unstable due to Klebsiella pneumonia. Having again blundered in front of Derek, Teddy considered herself doomed and wished Cristina good luck with her new attending, whom she pointed out never even let Cristina touch the patient. Cristina realized she needed Teddy to learn from and asked Owen to put in a good word for Teddy, but he did the exact opposite and told Derek that Teddy wouldn't have trouble finding a new job due to her connections on the East Coast. Derek did offer Teddy a permanent contract, but, unbeknownst to her, only because Tom Evans had declined the job.<ref>[[Hook, Line and Sinner]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy happily went to thank Owen as she heard from Cristina that he talked to Derek for her. However, Meredith found out the truth from Derek and observed Owen and Teddy closely all day as she was convinced Owen still had feelings for Teddy.<ref>[[How Insensitive]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a long day, Teddy went to Mark's place and stripped down to her underwear, only to find a naked [[Reed Adamson|Reed]] in Mark's bed. Mark suggested they could turn this into something fun, but Teddy declined. Owen suggested he do something to Mark to punish him, but Teddy wasn't mad as they weren't exclusive and she also didn't need Owen to defend her honor. Teddy later showed her romantic side when she opted to let two long-lost lovers catch up before their surgery. Owen admired her decision and looked at her longingly, which Cristina noticed after Meredith warned her to pay attention. In surgery, Owen finished Teddy's sentence and Richard likened it to his connection with Ellis Grey. Mark later came to apologize to Teddy. While she wasn't mad, she decided this thing between them was over. She later accidentally overheard Owen talking to Cristina about trying to get Teddy fired. He stated that Teddy was a trigger of his and that he didn't know how he felt about her as she's all wrapped up in his history and that she confused him. Teddy's pager gave away her presence and she rushed off to her patient.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref>\n\nFinding out the truth led to Teddy ignoring Owen outside of professional circumstances. She brushed off apologies and preferred to work in peace. They treated a gunshot victim together and took him to the OR. Cristina covered Teddy's post-ops and declined to scrub in. Since the patient was critical, neither of them had time to check their pagers, so Derek quietly informed Jackson about the shooter in the hospital and asked him to tell the attendings as soon as they were done. Teddy and Owen ignored Jackson's plea to stay in the OR per Derek's request and took the patient to the ICU.<ref>[[Sanctuary]], x</ref> As they were transporting the patient, Teddy opened up and said she came to realize that Owen tried to get her fired because he loved both her and Cristina and didn't want to choose himself. However, since their\ualives were now in danger, Teddy really wanted him to choose. He refused to do so. They found a dead resident in the ICU and decided to take the patient outside as they would be sitting ducks in the ICU. Outside, Owen and Teddy discovered that Cristina was still inside. She noticed how worried Owen was and realized he had made his choice. She told him it was okay to choose and body blocked the police officer so he could go back inside to find Cristina. Teddy herself boarded an ambulance and rode to Seattle Pres to operate on Alex's gunshot wound to the chest. She managed to save him despite all the blood loss.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy at Owen and Cristina's wedding.]] Teddy didn't suffer any problems following the shooting as she never faced the shooter. She kept checking on Alex and eventually advised him to have the bullet taken out after it surfaced, but he decided to keep it since chicks dug it. Teddy attended the meeting where Derek resigned and Richard was reinstated as Chief of Surgery. She and Owen worked on a case together and he inquired about the guy she was dating. She assured him she was happy he was getting married to Cristina and didn't elaborate. Meredith later walked in when Teddy and her guy, [[Andrew Perkins]], the trauma counselor brought in for the hospital staff, were making out. Teddy quickly left and went to tell Arizona. She later attended Owen and Cristina's wedding at Meredith's house.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\nAs Cristina was suffering from PTSD, Teddy and Owen advocated for her to be allowed back into the OR. Teddy had an ex vivo heart reconstruction planned and figured the pressure would be no problem for Cristina. Cristina was allowed on the case albeit with a serious lack of enthusiasm. When Teddy talked about Andrew with Arizona, it dawned on her that she did most of the talking while he just listened. In the OR, Teddy welcomed Cristina back and the surgery started. However, Jackson knocked over a tray, which triggered Cristina's PTSD and led to her lying down on the floor, unable to move. Teddy had to finish the risky surgery on her own and pulled it off. She then went to Andrew and voiced her concerns, but he said listening to her wasn't work to him and told her that he was enjoying this thing between them. They shared a kiss.<ref>[[Shock to the System]], x</ref>\n\nDespite knowing he'd leave Seattle after a month and planning to play it cool and smart, Teddy got attached to Andrew. On his last day, she avoided him all day in order not to cry. When he came to get her for their planned goodbye dinner, she confessed the way she felt about him. He hugged her and pointed out her habit to fall for unavailable men, noting she deserved better.<ref>[[Superfreak]], x</ref>\n\nWith Cristina no longer working on surgical cases, Teddy tried Jackson as her resident. She discovered his poor penmanship and ended up dictating charts till late at night, exhausting Teddy to the point where she refused to sleep with Mark to distract him from Arizona and Callie's relationship. When she noticed that Jackson flirted his way into her OR, she confronted him about it and said he was more than just the pretty face he made himself out to be.<ref>[[Can't Fight Biology]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Richard had all attendings pitch him an idea for a large sum of money for their department, the fourth-year residents had to step in as attendings. Cristina and April were to decide if Teddy's patient, [[Roy Henley]] was a transplant candidate, but Cristina barely participated to the point where Teddy told her to either get back in the game or get out. Psyched out by Callie, Teddy didn't stick to her notes and botched her pitch about stem cell heart generation because of her grudge against Derek. Meanwhile, Teddy thinking of her as useless made Cristina gather herself and make a decision regarding the patient.<ref>[[Almost Grown]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy briefly appeared in the [[Seattle Medical Documentary]], where she was seen ranting about the security system that trapped Jackson with her coding patient between doors. She also congratulated Arizona on winning the Carter Madison Grant.<ref>[[These Arms of Mine]], x</ref>\n\nIn a final attempt to lure Cristina back to surgery, Teddy had her monitor Roy while she went to pick up lungs. While it should have been an easy day, Cristina had to deal with multiple complications. With some help from Meredith, she perfectly managed. Teddy then returned with the lungs and the surgery went perfectly. Despite of that, Cristina realized that while she could still be a surgeon, she didn't want to be one anymore, so she quit.<ref>[[That's Me Trying]], x</ref>\n\nWhile presenting Roy's case, Teddy found herself under attack from various colleagues, including Derek, who thought she put too much pressure on Cristina, leading to her quitting. Missing her student, Teddy planned to corner Cristina at her housewarming party and convince her to come back. However, Derek thought it was time for them to back off. He arrived to the party early and took Cristina up to her roof, where they wouldn't find her.<ref>[[Something's Gotta Give]], x</ref>\n\nWith her star student gone, Teddy put her energy in finding a boyfriend. Despite her disliking it, she used online dating and went on a couple of bad dates. After she cut one of those dates short, she joined her colleagues at Joe's, only to find out that Cristina was working there. Teddy found this depressing and, adding the fact that her aspirational couple had broken up and was living on separate continents, got really drunk. Joe took away her keys so she went to the hospital to kill time, where she talked to Meredith about how she was depressed over what had happened recently.<ref>[[Slow Night, So Long]], x</ref>\n\n\nFeeling directionless without Cristina, whom Teddy learned went on a fishing trip with Derek, Teddy encountered [[Henry Burton]] on the elevator. He asked her how he looked and promptly informed her he was going to propose to his girlfriend. Teddy complimented his looks and added his girlfriend would be a fool to say no. She later ran into him again at the nurses' station and found out she had declined the proposal. He admitted he had proposed to her for her insurance since he capped out on his three surgeries ago. Teddy took his chart and learned he was suffering from Von Hippel-Lindau disease, having spent  days over the last three years. Henry told her Richard had just discharged him because he couldn't afford the surgery to remove the most recent tumor from his adrenal gland. Teddy then pleaded with Richard to operate on Henry pro bono. He refused since the hospital couldn't afford to pay for the long-term care that would ensue. Teddy stated he would do it if the patient were Derek's or Bailey's and said she needed something good to happen after Cristina quit, which Teddy partly blamed on herself. Richard then agreed to set up a meeting with the review board, which only led to the recommendation of a medicalert bracelet. Richard proceeded to discharge Henry after all, setting him up with an appointment at the Clinic. Teddy then dropped by Henry's room and offered to marry Henry since she had great insurance. He initially refused but Teddy persisted that she took an oath and couldn't leave him to fend for himself anymore than she could if she had found him bleeding out in the street.<ref>[[Adrift and at Peace]], x</ref> \n\nThey proceeded with the marriage and Teddy called Owen from city hall to come be her witness on a random weekday. She had the justice of peace skip right to the end of the ceremony since she had to go into work. Owen was baffled but she refused to talk about it with him. As they arrived at work, they found out that there had been a shooting at a nearby college, an emotional trigger for the staff given the recent hospital shooting. Cristina had been near the scene and arrived at the hospital with her hands plugging a hole in the patient's right ventricle. She moved to the OR along with the patient. Teddy paged Jackson for back-up. During the procedure, Richard arrived and identified the patient as the shooter. Several of the OR staff, including Jackson, couldn't bring themselves to help save the shooter. While Teddy needed a moment to gather herself, she reminded herself of her oath, which had also made her save several Iraqi soldiers who had blown up dozens of American soldiers. Unlike Jackson, Cristina decided to stay and help out. Owen found out and came to check on Cristina. Teddy gestured at him that she was doing okay in there. Cristina herself also stated she had no problem being there. Eventually, they finished the procedure successfully while the rest of the staff had gathered in the gallery. Richard proudly announced that his team had managed to save every last victim of the shooting despite the difficult circumstances. Afterward, Teddy met up with Henry at Joe's to arrange the insurance matter. He insisted on raising a glass first since they had skipped all the typical wedding stuff. She wasn't feeling it since she had spent her day saving a bad person but Henry reminded her that she had also saved him. She then agreed to the drink.<ref>[[Disarm]], x</ref>\n\nHenry was re-admitted for his surgery and informed his surgical team that he was now on his wife's insurance. Richard thought his girlfriend has wised up, at which point Teddy arrived in the room to pick the last few documents needing her signature pre-op. Henry then informed Richard that Teddy was his wife. Richard then went to yell at Teddy for committing fraud and acting unethically, which Lexie pointed out the medical community was actually split on. Teddy brushed off Richard's concerns and said it was done anyway. She then returned the signed documents to Henry, who hated that he had nothing to give her in return. She wished him good luck. Richard and Bailey later informed Henry that they needed to remove his kidney and Henry insisted on getting Teddy's opinion. Richard took the opportunity to berate Teddy some more so she pointed out other inappropriate relationships in the hospital. During the surgery, they found a cyst on Henry's pancreas and since removing it would make him a diabetic, they required her consent to remove it. Unbeknownst to Teddy, Henry had put her down as his emergency contact person. Also, Richard wanted to make sure that Henry had the support system to deal with diabetes. Teddy admitted she had no clue if there was someone he could lean on but gave permission to act as he saw fit. After the surgery, Teddy ran into Bailey. She was prepared for a long speech about how Richard was right but Bailey only confided in her about her fling with nurse Eli and the \"why not\" attitude she had adapted, thus not judging Teddy at all. Teddy sat by Henry's bedside until he woke up. She broke the news of him possibly developing diabetes to him, bringing up the emergency contact person issue. He knew she was angry about that and informed her his parents were dead and his estranged sister lived in Prague. Between his condition and him switching jobs regularly after maxing out on insurance policies, it was also hard to make friends, meaning Teddy was the closest thing he had to a friend. She sympathized with him and held his hand.<ref>[[Start Me Up]], x</ref>\n\nCristina started working on Teddy's service again, competing with Jackson over first assist for a CABG.<ref>[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]], x</ref> Together with Cristina, she performed a long diagonal aortic anastomosis during a heart transplant on a newborn in record-time.<ref>[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]</ref> \n\nTeddy was intercepted by Meredith for a consult as she was on her way out to meet a date in the lobby. Teddy's date agreed to wait for her wrap things up. Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Henry, who announced that he was in for some kind of test. Henry then introduced himself to William, who assumed he was another patient of Teddy's. As Teddy returned to Meredith for the consult, Henry sat down and started a conversation with William. Teddy ordered another set of X-rays and changed back into her scrubs. The images confirmed their suspicion of an aortic aneurysm. Teddy ordered a CT and then went to tell William that he'd have to wait longer than anticipated. He had no problem with that since he had Henry to keep him company. The patient coded in the scanner. While Meredith had started CPR, Teddy looked at the scans and diagnosed a dissecting aneurysm. They rushed the patient to the OR, where they opened up the patient without scrubbing. However, the aorta shredded right in front of their eyes and the patient bled out on the table. Teddy then returned to the waiting area, where William was making a phone call. Henry took the opportunity to inform her that he had vetted William and thought they could do better than him. William then informed Teddy he had managed to push back their reservation. Teddy left with him, sharing a meaningful look with Henry as they walked off.<ref>[[Golden Hour]], x</ref> \n\n\nThough the newlyweds both maintained that theirs was a simple marriage of convenience, and Teddy continued to date other men, Henry later confessed that he had feelings for Teddy. She told him she did not feel the same way.\uaWhen Andrew Perkins returned and asked Teddy to move to Germany with him, she accepted, and agreed to divorce Henry. However, in the\uaaftermath of a plane crash shortly after making that decision, Teddy changed her mind and told Henry that she was falling in love with him. The two began their married life properly, but not long into their wedded bliss, Henry died, leaving Teddy devastated. Teddy loved Henry and she blamed Owen for his death.\ua\n\n\nAfter Henry died, Teddy was not aware until after she finished her surgery on her patient. Cristina was the one to tell her in the scrub room and she broke down crying. She sat and cried next to Henry in the OR where he died. In her grieving process, she called Cristina in during her surgeries and made her tell her the exact story of Henry's surgery. This went on for about two weeks. She later went to a support group for widows to help her cope with his death, only to laugh at one of the other widows for saying her husband had \"minor congestive heart failure\" because according to Teddy, there is no such thing and he was lucky to survive as long as he did.\uaFinally, she was able to say the words \"I am a widow.\"\ua\n\n\nWhile Teddy was helping out Bailey and Callie with their patient, Owen told her that someone called him to ask if she was going to take the Chief job at MEDCOM, about which he didn't know anything. She told him that she planned to tell him about the job offer, and he was bummed that he now has to look for a new\ua[[Attending#Department Head|Head]]\uaof\ua[[Cardiothoracic Surgery]], on top of all other surgeons who were leaving [[Seattle]]. She then told him that she was not taking the job, but just hadn't had time to tell MEDCOM yet. Later in surgery, he wanted to know why she said no to the offer, especially because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. He asked her about her loyalty to her country. She then told him that she'd love to leave the hospital, as it kept reminding her of her\ua[[Henry Burton|deceased husband]]. \"I would love to leave here, and never look back. But you are as broken and beaten as I have ever seen you,\" she said, silencing him. \"And after everything I've put you through, the tolerance and kindness and friendship that you have shown me, I am not going to leave you, because of my loyalty. I am not going to leave here for MEDCOM or anywhere else,\" she told him, after which she continued operating.\n\nOwen later approached her, saying that he now knew why she tried so hard to keep Cristina in Seattle. \"If Cristina were staying, you'd be taking that job,\" he said. She stayed silent, and he assured her he'd be fine. She told him he wouldn't be, as he was losing the love of his life. Owen then opened up to her and said that he already missed Cristina, while she hadn't even left yet. \"I wish I could tell you that that will go away, but it won't,\" she said, before walking away again. He later asked her to come to a conference room to talk. While she was saying she was happy to stay as it'd be like them back in Iraq again, he suddenly said that she was fired. She laughed, thinking he was joking, but she realized it was serious when he told her it was \"effective and immediately\".\n\n[[File:xLeavingSeattle.png|thumb|px|Teddy hugs Owen one last time before leaving the hospital.]]\n\n\"Now, I know you have other opportunities, so if you need to make those phone calls...\" he began, but she told him that he couldn't tell her when to go and when to stay. \"I don't want you here anymore!\" he yelled, continuing that she had to have seen it coming for months as she had been disruptive in the OR and hostile and insubordinate towards him in front of staff and students. \"We're past all of that,\" she still tried to talk him out of his decision.\ua\"We are, because you're fired,\" he told her once again. \"It's a done deal, pack your stuff,\" he said. She then angrily left the room while scolding him. Moments later, she came back in, crying. She realized that being fired by Owen was the only way he could make her do what she really wanted to do: taking the job at MEDCOM. She hugged him tightly, urging him to fight for Cristina. \"You go, and be great,\" he told her, while hugging her too.<ref>[[Flight]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Megan was found in a basement of an abandoned house, she was transferred to a hospital in Germany. Owen told Amelia to request Teddy while on the phone with the hospital, since he was in disbelief that the patient was identified correctly as his sister. Teddy reassured Amelia and Owen that the patient was Megan Hunt and made sure Megan would be transferred to Grey Sloan. Owen refused to talk to Teddy when she had tried to call him.<ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref> [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy comes to Seattle to support Owen and Megan.]] After Megan had arrived in Seattle, Teddy surprised Owen by showing up to support him. Megan and Teddy caught up and discussed a guy Teddy had had a few dates with. Teddy briefly met Amelia when she stopped by Megan's room and also checked in with Arizona and April in the cafeteria. During Megan's first surgery, Teddy helped to calm a panicking and fearful Owen. After the surgery, Teddy found out about Meredith and Nathan's short-lived romance and pressed Owen, Nathan, and Meredith to come clean to Megan, as she thought Megan had the right know, especially with Meredith as her surgeon. Amelia stood up for Meredith, which resulted in Teddy scolding her for not being present to support Owen. Teddy continued to urge Nathan and Owen to tell the truth, which was overheard by Maggie, who sided with Teddy. While waiting with Owen during the surgery to close Megan's abdominal wound, Teddy brought Amelia's absence to Owen's attention. Nathan then came to get them as the surgery was almost over, but they came just in time to witness Meredith realizing there wasn't enough tissue to close.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy was with Megan when she woke up after the failed surgery. Owen privately confessed to her that he was happy, since it meant Megan couldn't go back to Iraq just yet. Meredith later paged Teddy and asked her to be a part of her planned abdominal transplant surgery for Megan. Meredith assured her she could separate the personal and professional, so Teddy agreed. She was excited at the prospect of this procedure being a possibility to help many soldiers with similar injuries. While Meredith went on to search for a donor, Megan's loved ones, including Teddy, sprung into action to find a way to get Megan's son Farouk to the U.S., but to no avail. After sending Owen out to run an errand, Teddy, Megan, and Evelyn discussed his marriage to Amelia and came to conclude that it was a sham marriage. They helped him realize that Amelia was absent and that his not needing her there for him was a problem, too. Teddy then went to scrub in for the surgery, which they pulled off successfully. That night, Owen and Teddy went to relax at the park. He talked about he and Amelia had grown apart and then leaned in to kiss Teddy. She broke it off after kissing him back. She explained that he was her favorite human on the planet and she knew him well enough to know that if they were meant to be more than friends, it couldn't start with his cheating on Amelia. The shame and guilt would kill him, so she decided they needed to stay just friends for now.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref> With Megan's health problems solved, Teddy returned to Germany.\n\nMonths later, she was surprised by Owen showing up at her place in the middle of the night. He then revealed to her that his marriage with Amelia was over, leaving nothing standing in their way. They then kissed and proceeded to have sex. After sex, they admitted they both had imagined that moment. They reminisced about the first time they met and operated together, something they both wanted to do for the rest of their lives. As they cuddled and watched the snow, she recalled the moment he made it snow in Iraq for his troops. She deemed him great at grand gestures, which led to her wondering if this was one of them. While she didn't like the country, she did like the life she build for herself in Germany. Owen suggested he move to Germany as he really wanted to be with her, for real. She asked him to spend some more days with her to figure things out and also questioned the end of his marriage. He admitted that that was what led him to her. She questioned that and he revealed that Amelia told him to go see her. Teddy soon figured out Amelia did so shortly after they had had sex again, which was just one day before he hopped on the plane to Germany.\n\nInfuriated over this, Teddy packed his bag for him while blaming him for being terrified of being alone. She listed all his relationships and suggested he had a pathological need to be coupled up so no one would see how sad and empty he is. He bounced back that she was afraid to be happy, stating that she was fine to marry the dead guy but wasn't willing to enter a relationship with a man who truly loved her. She forbade him from talking about Henry. He continued to say that she would rather burn everything to the ground than risk being hurt. She then yelled that hurting was all he ever did, stringing her along for years with half-baked declarations and then marrying other women. He had actually convinced her that he was truly in love with her, that he wanted her, but she came to realize it never was about her. She stated she was done being his sloppy seconds or his consolation prize. Owen told her that the thing with the snow, he did it for her because he knew how much she loved Christmas. Teddy ignored it and told him they were done. She threw him out of her apartment and broke down.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\nSeeing how miserable Owen was, Amelia reached out to Teddy on his behalf, but Teddy made it clear she had no interest in him anymore.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]],x</ref>\n\n\nNearly three months later, she arrived at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] again and was unable to find anybody she knew. She finally ran into Bailey, who had her scrub in for an emergent surgery. In surgery, Teddy told Bailey that she came here looking for a job. Since Bailey didn't immediately respond, Teddy tried to take it back. After surgery, Teddy apologized to Bailey for putting her on the spot. Bailey told Teddy that her question was actually yet another sign in her life. She had wanted to temporarily step down from the Chief of Surgery position to fall in love with surgery and research again and spend more time with her family. She then offered the job of Interim Chief of Surgery to Teddy, who was very much interested. After their talking it over, Teddy stayed in [[Lila (All of Me)|Lila's]] mother's ICU room so she could see her daughter's wedding via livestream. Lila's mother noticed how moved she was and how she kept touching her stomach. She asked Teddy if she was expecting, which Teddy confirmed.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nThe next morning, Teddy went to surprise Owen at his house but was instead greeted at the door by [[Betty Nelson|Betty]], who mentioned the [[Leo Hunt|baby]]. Teddy's vision of a future in Seattle was shattered and she claimed to be at the wrong house. She returned to the hospital to tell Bailey she couldn't accept the job after all because of her not wanting to return to Seattle. On her way out, she bumped into Owen, Amelia, and Leo and hastily said goodbye. While walking, she started experiencing pain in her leg and, suspecting a deep vein thrombosis, she had [[Casey Parker|intern Casey]] get her [[Maggie Pierce]] for a consult. During the consult, Teddy found out about Maggie's relations to Meredith, Amelia, and Owen. She pressed Maggie not to tell anyone about her pregnancy and left against medical advice.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> Maggie had trouble keeping the secret from Amelia and reached out to Teddy to ask her to inform Owen, but Teddy did not answer her calls.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref> Maggie ended up telling Meredith while Teddy stayed holed up in her hotel room, agonizing over what to do next.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref> [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith invites Teddy to talk.]] Meredith tracked her down to a playground where she used to make Cristina get her coffee. Teddy understood that Maggie had told her. Meredith invited her to her house to talk while she baked cookies for Zola's bake sale. Teddy took over when she saw how clumsy Meredith was. Teddy shared her plan to go back to Germany and raise the baby by herself, because she found out that all the terrible things she said about Owen she had come to Seattle to apologize for were actually true. Meredith explained the Betty and Leo situation to her and asked her why she was still in Seattle, but Teddy had no answer to that. Teddy said she hated Owen, but Meredith asked he\uaif she hated him enough to deny her child a father who was not a terrible man. Later, Teddy talked about how she joined the Army to get out of New York City where her best friend and parents died. Then she met Owen, the buttoned-up and decisive surgeon who never had doubts and did not try to fix her. She instantly fell in love with him, but he was engaged and she couldn't stand losing someone else, so she stayed quiet and played it safe. Telling Meredith about it made her realize she actually still loved him. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith tells Teddy that kids change everything.]] She then brought up that she did not know how to tell Owen. She asked Meredith if the tumor removal had changed Amelia to the point where she now did want a family, because Owen had told her all about Amelia going back and forth on that subject. Meredith didn't know where Amelia was on that subject, but she did urge Teddy to tell Owen as soon as possible to minimize the damage the news would cause. Teddy knew she would never lose Owen, because he's loyal, but she did not want him to get together with her out of obligation for the baby. Meredith told her that everything would change once the baby arrived and reminded Teddy that she would be telling Owen for the baby, not for herself. Meredith sent her back to the hotel with some cookies and once again urged her to tell Owen soon.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy visited Owen's house the next day, but she found Owen and Amelia panicking because Betty had run away from school. Teddy decided not to surprise them with more bad news and helped to look for Betty in the city, but none of them found her. They later reconvened at the house. Owen took Amelia to a meeting while Teddy stayed behind in case Betty came back. He returned with Leo later and while they were alone, she brought up her last visit. He knew he should have called her to tell her about Leo, but he was too embarrassed to do so after her accusations against him. He talked about how he always wanted a kid and then Leo turned into a whole family situation with Betty and Amelia. Realizing Owen was happy with his life, she decided again not to tell him and left while he comforted a crying Leo.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy came by the hospital to help out when a windstorm was approaching the city. Owen asked her how long she would be staying in Seattle, to which she replied she didn't know yet. She got pulled onto a case with Owen and she spotted Betty out in the ER, alerting Owen to her presence. After he made sure she was okay, they scrubbed in for surgery. She told him they needed to talk afterwards and agreed to get coffee. However, during the surgery, he figured out that her news must have been the reason she came to Seattle. As soon as the critical part of the surgery over, she blurted out the news, but she was paged to the ER immediately after, leaving a baffled Owen behind. Teddy ran into Amelia downstairs who thanked her for her help with Betty and then went off to look for Owen. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen confronts Teddy about her hiding the pregnancy for so long.]] Owen caught up with Teddy on the elevator ride up to the OR and asked her how she could have kept this for him for so long. She bounced back that it hadn't exactly been easy for her. She told him no one expected him to do anything. Their talk was interrupted by Amelia, who got on to tell Owen that she was planning on becoming Betty's official foster mother. She then picked up on the awkward vibe between them and asked what was going on, after which the power died due to the storm and they got stuck on the elevator together.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nOwen informed Amelia and vented some anger at Teddy for keeping at a secret until today, but they had to focus on saving the patient who had started crashing. Teddy explained she came to tell him but found out he had started another family in record time. She clarified that by not expecting him to do anything, she meant that the two of them getting together was off the table, so he could be as involved as he wanted to be and stay with Amelia. She then told him she was staying in Seattle because her baby deserved a father and she deserved her friend. When the patient had been stabilized, she told him she was at sixteen weeks, that the baby was fine, and that she did not know the sex yet. Later, Amelia yelled at her for not realizing she had a stake in this, too, with Betty and Leo. Their argument ended when the elevator doors opened and they rushed to the OR, where they saved him. Afterwards, Teddy admitted she did want him to be involved. He did, too. They then agreed to figure things out together and decided to celebrate that they were having a baby.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]],x</ref>\n\nHaving decided to stay in Seattle, Teddy approached Bailey for a job, but she was referred to Alex, the new Chief. Alex made her audition for Maggie, which enraged her. She ran into Owen and took out her frustration in him, saying she had to uproot\uaher whole life so he could be a part of the baby's life. He once again blamed her for staying silent for weeks because he and Amelia weren't back together when she first arrived, meaning she was the reason he was in this crap situation. Amelia overheard that talk, so Owen went after her to clarify things while Teddy approached Maggie about the job. Maggie was mad at her for waiting too long to tell Owen and Amelia, but she did acknowledge Teddy had done some great work on the department and decided to shove aside her personal contempt so they could work together. [[File:x-.png|thumb|Owen and Teddy make arrangements for the future.]] Later, Teddy found out that Owen had accidentally been paralyzed in the OR and she sat by his bed until he recovered. She then told him that she did not set out to hurt Amelia and even though she made mistakes, he could not blame everything on her. His anger and having to work under Maggie made her think about going back to Germany, because she had the perfect job, which was still open, and generous maternity leave there, while Owen did not have to sacrifice a thing. She invited him to move to Germany with her, but he told her she could have his job, realizing it was time for him to make a sacrifice. She happily accepted and they hugged it out.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nNow officially employed, Teddy made acquaintances with Tom Koracick as he was practicing for Catherine's surgery. While he was nervous, she expressed confidence in him. Shortly after the surgery, she ran into him and congratulated him on the good outcome. He was a bit down because they didn't get it all. To cheer him up, she offered to buy him a drink, but he preferred a rain check because he wanted to smell good when she spent money on him.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nOver time, Tom and Teddy interacted some more while at work. On Christmas Eve, Owen took Teddy out into the ambulance bay to stand in the snow. He invited her to spend Christmas with him, Amelia, and Leo\uabut she would be covering the ER. He assured her that they would establish their own traditions with their baby, too. On New Year's Eve, Teddy attended the party thrown by Alex and Jo, which is where she shared her first kiss with Tom at midnight. Nearing Valentine's Day, Teddy had another ultrasound with Owen present. Together, they found out that they were having a baby daughter. To celebrate Valentine's Day, Tom took Teddy to get the best mani/pedi in Seattle to help her relax. Afterwards, he arranged dinner for two of them.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nAs their relationship developed, Tom and Teddy found out they were staying at the same hotel and bonded over the breakfast buffet. Owen wasn't happy when he found out about the two of them. Later, Tom and Teddy worked on [[Lucille Reid]], a patient who had a very close friend by her side at all times aside from her husband. In surgery, Teddy commented on their situation and said the whole thing was just a whole lot of denial, thinking that Lucille's friend was settling for table scraps because she was married. She said there's always a torchbearer in that type of situation. Tom thought she was talking from experience as a torchbearer from her situation with Owen and left, stating he was done. After the successful surgery, Lucille's husband Marvin told her that the situation was hard to figure out. Lucille and Julian just decided a long time ago to let their love just be the easy kind and not risk it on something as fickle as sex and romance. While he was Lucille's third husband, there had only been one Julian, and he was fine with that. Afterwards, Teddy comforted a distressed Owen when the arrival of Betty's parents made him fear that he would lose Leo. That night, Teddy visited Tom in his hotel room and told him that sometimes, friendships are meant to be just that despite big feelings. While she and Owen were meant to be just friends, she thought she and Tom were something else. They shared a kiss and he invited her in for a club sandwich.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy was surprised to be dating at  weeks old, but she enjoyed it. When the hospital was flooded with victims from a mass overdose, Teddy was forced to page Owen while he was saying goodbye to Leo. He happily accepted the patient influx to keep himself distracted. Later, Betty was found was to be amongst the patient and she started to show symptoms of an aortic dissection, caused by her combining meth and opioids. Teddy diagnosed it and decided to operate herself because the situation was so dire that it would be better for Amelia if her sister was not Betty's surgeon. Maggie agreed and let her do it. Teddy put in a stent and also had to reconstruct her entire distal aorta, but Teddy pulled it off and Betty made it through. Teddy delivered the news to Owen, Betty's parents, and Amelia, who hugged her in relief. At the end of the day, Teddy took moment in a quiet ER to unwind.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, Teddy and Tom attended Catherine's party together. Owen and Amelia caught the two of them making out in the hallway and Teddy shared that Tom gave her a surprise trip to Palm Springs, which Owen did not like. He provided her with drinks and snacks throughout the evening, knowing she wasn't having a good time with Owen angrily staring at them the entire time. He offered to feign diarrhea, but she didn't want him to leave a party thrown in his honor. Shortly before Catherine's arrival, an argument erupted between Owen and Tom when he tried to talk Teddy out of taking the trip. She insisted on going and Owen called him out for preying on a pregnant woman and yelled that he did not want a dirtbag like Tom around his daughter, stating he was not a father. Tom then punched him. Owen wanted to retaliate, but Teddy blocked him and said Tom was a father. Tom then put his hand in an ice bucket and went to give the speech, which was cut short when a supposed fire broke out in the kitchen and everyone was evacuated.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy and Tom enjoyed their trip together.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref> When she returned, Owen was grumpy because he was on his own with Leo now that Amelia had decided to remove herself from the situation. They treated an expecting couple and Teddy sat by the woman's bed in the ICU to make sure she made it through the night. Owen offered to do it, but she preferred to do it herself and Tom was away to Baltimore, so Owen decided to sit with her and he rubbed her feet. When the patient deteriorated and became at risk of losing her baby because a necessary hysterectomy, the doctors were thrown for a loop when [[Vincenzo DeLuca]] came out of nowhere promising a miraculous fix with his gestational sacks research. However, he was overstepping as the research was not even close to human trials, so Alex stopped that from happening and the doctors planned the hysterectomy. Teddy later comforted the couple as they mourned the loss of the baby and broke down in Owen's arms once she left the room as Tom watched them.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nWith a birthing class coming up, Teddy invited Tom to join while Owen also told her he was coming. However, before the class started, she started to experience pain. She thought it was stress and went to Maggie's blue-light room, but that did not help, so she had intern Casey page OB and Owen, who left Tom in the birthing class. Carina examined her and diagnosed cervical insufficiency, so Teddy put herself in a Trendelenburg position. On Carina's suggestion, Owen put a gurney next to hers and started talking to Teddy and his daughter to calm them down, praising Teddy, while Teddy herself felt too shy to talk to baby, thinking the insufficiency meant she was already failing as a mother. Tom later joined them when he found out what happened. Teddy told him she did not want to worry him. He then sat by her side and fed her ice cream.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after, Tom and Teddy started looking at houses together. Owen offered Teddy to move in with him, but she declined and said she'd figure it out. They were surprised when [[Megan Hunt]] dropped by the hospital to assist on a case. When Megan found out what had been going on between them, she called Owen a dum-dum for letting it get to that point by his behavior, to which Teddy kind of agreed. Megan later sat down with Teddy as she was looking at houses and told her that while Owen was an idiot, he did love her and that Teddy could let it be easy if she wanted it to. Teddy said she did not want to take Amelia's vacant spot in that house, which Megan understood.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref> Megan convinced Owen to go to therapy. Per Megan's request, Teddy checked in on him after his first session via text message.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nWith the due date three weeks away, Teddy still had not found a place because she kept comparing everything to her perfect place in Germany. Meanwhile, Tom made arrangements to have someone cover him in Baltimore so he could stay with her until the birth and asked Teddy if that was okay with her, which was the case. While Tom set out to find her a house, Teddy noticed that [[Jo Wilson|Jo Karev]] was off balance when she made a mistake with [[Gus Carter]]. She tried to get Jo to talk to her, but Jo refused, so Teddy took her concerns to Chief Bailey. Afterwards, Tom paged her to a room to show her that he had rented her the perfect place that closely resembled her place in Germany, stating that the baby deserved a happy mother and more than a hotel room. Teddy loved the place and agreed to move in.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy and Tom started planning the nursery together. With [[Maggie Pierce]] out camping, Teddy took the case of [[Gus Carter]] while also treating [[Kari Donnelly]]. After hearing Kari talk about how [[Toby Donnelly|Toby's bravery]] had inspired her to live her best life, Teddy realized that she loved Owen and wanted more than the safe feeling that Tom gave her. While Tom waited for her at home with dinner and IKEA furniture for the nursery, she went over to Owen's house but only Amelia and Leo were home. Teddy thought she and Owen were back together, but Amelia was just there for Leo. Teddy then told her that Tom made her laugh and feel safe, but Owen made her feel passion, rage, and ecstasy. While she and Owen hurt each other, she wanted that kind of love in her life so her daughter, too, would know it. She wanted to tell Owen all that before the baby was born, but Amelia pointed out that her water had broken.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\n\nAs fog started to cover Seattle, Amelia made arrangements with the hospital and set up a babysit for Leo while Teddy realized she had not planned for the baby's arrival at all, something her late mother would chastise her for. Amelia timed Teddy's contractions and deemed they had enough time to drive to the hospital herself. However, the freeway was closed due to the fog and they got stuck in a traffic jam, but Amelia got inventive and made a police officer drive them in his car. Teddy appreciated her genius move and stated they could be friends in another life. Amelia said they could be friends in this one if Teddy could overcome her disdain. Teddy said that was only last year, but that was to blame on the tumor. She then asked Amelia if she was still in love with Owen. Amelia said maybe she was a little bit, but that she fell in love quickly and easily. She then let slip Owen's brief fling with Carina while talking about having a little crush on Carina, which agitated Teddy.\n\nThey were met by Owen when they arrived at Grey Sloan. Teddy yelled at him for hiding his dating her OB. Owen helped her get settled in the delivery room and apologized for the Carina thing, while Carina said it meant very little to her. Carina examined her and found that the crowning was happening fast because it was a geriatric pregnancy, a term that did not put Teddy at ease. She forbade Owen from watching what was going on down there and started pushing. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy and Owen hold their baby girl Allison.]] With the head halfway out, Teddy had to wait for the next contraction to push to avoid tearing, so she asked Owen to distract her. He then told her he had always been in love with her, but it felt so good that he always sabotaged it himself before life could do it. He had learned that in therapy, but he had overcome that now and he wanted to spend the rest of his life proving that he was worthy of her love. Soon after, the baby girl was delivered and the parents simultaneously decided on Allison as a name. They spent the rest of the day cuddling their baby girl, while Tom was still in the dark as he was setting up the nursery.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy struggles as a new mother.]]\nShe, Owen, and Allison were soon visited by Amelia, who brought by Leo. Teddy was forced to take care of Leo when Bailey came to fetch Owen and Amelia for a trauma. She couldn't get him to stop crying, but she was saved by Tom when he came in and took him off her hands. Tom figured she had given birth when she didn't reply to his calls. He also knew she must have gotten back together with Owen, who rode in on a white horse and made all the right promises. Teddy took all the blame and started telling Tom he was a wonderful. He knew that and told her she would come to regret her decision, and then he would be there for her because he loved her. In the meantime, they would remain friends. Tom then took Leo back to daycare. A week later, Teddy had returned to her hotel room, where she was holed up with a crying Allison. She became miserable. Owen dropped by with supplies and invited her to come live with him, but she refused, stating they weren't supposed to start their lives together in that house. Owen took care of Allison so she could go shower.\n\nTheir arrangement continued over the next couple of weeks, with Owen eager to help out but handling things badly. When Teddy had a clogged duct, he offered to milk her. She was offended and took off with Allison. She developed the habit to go to the hospital with the baby to calm herself down whenever she would panic. During one of those visits, she ran into Bailey and she confessed that she hated maternity leave and that she felt like a bad mother. Bailey distracted her with some work talk and stressed that hating maternity leave didn't mean she was a bad mother, because Bailey had hated it, too. Another week later, Owen finally stepped up and came to tell Teddy he had listed his house and already had hundreds of listings for other houses to look at. He had also upgraded them to a suite for the meantime. Teddy thanked him for finally listing the house and they shared a kiss.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOne morning, Owen was paged to the hospital for a trauma so Teddy had to take Leo to daycare. She brought Allison and hung out at the hospital for a while. Owen found her changing Allison outside on a bench near the coffee cart and took over from her since she was failing. Teddy was planning on going to the park but Owen suggested a tour of the hospital instead, humoring Teddy as he knew she was missing the smell of blood. He showed her scans of a patient of his with a dissection. She pitched a solution that had good results on a case she had back in Germany. Owen was informed that Tom was approaching so they moved to the OR gallery, where she told Allison about the cool things they get to do in there. Owen then suggested he stay home with Allison for a while so she could go back to work. She refused because she didn't like failing as a mother but Owen said being back to work would make her happy again, which in turn would make her a better mother. Besides, he didn't like work when he had to avoid Tom. She then happily accepted his offer and went to get changed right away, leaving Allison in his care.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after returning to work, Teddy worked with Maggie and Taryn on a woman who had been hit by the frozen body of a stowaway who had fallen out of a plane. Teddy had seen a similar case in Germany. Link came to assist and Teddy asked him to harvest a vein from the patient's leg but by the time he was done scrubbing in, the patient had been declared dead. Teddy felt that the world was broken, not just the medical system, as it forced people to climb into planes and freeze to death and then crash into innocent people who were in the absolute worst place on Earth possible; a feeling that only got stronger now that she had a baby to raise in that world. Owen came to pick her and Leo up. On their way out, they ran into Tom, who had gotten rid of the restraining order so Owen could return to work. Owen surprised them both by revealing he had taken a job at Pac-North. Tom thought he would come to regret that and invited him to call him when that happened, reminding Teddy that the same was still true for when she regretted choosing Owen over him. Teddy and Owen walked off smiling and she teased him about his new workplace.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Owen dropped off a box of handmade costumes his mother had made for him and Megan. Teddy was impressed Evelyn had the time to make costumes herself while working full-time and raising two kids by herself. They agreed to meet up that night for the parade on the peds floor. She, Bailey, and Tom operated on a man who was competing in a costume contest, which led her to wonder when costumes became so important. She thought Owen was equating good costumes to good parenting. She didn't know what they were doing since they skipped so many steps at once by going from best friends to a family of four overnight. Tom told her he didn't understand what she was doing either and told her not to let Owen make her feel inept at motherhood over costumes. Bailey advised Teddy not to worry about the costumes and just enjoy the time with her kids. After taking the patient's loved ones to go see him post-op, Teddy met up with Owen on the peds floor. She dressed up as a kick-ass surgeon and told him she wouldn't be like his mother. He knew that, which is why he brought over the box to see if any costumes might fit Leo or Allison. She then understood he hadn't brought over the box to shame her and admitted it had inspired her. She revealed she had dressed up their children as zombies, which neither he nor Bailey liked as a costume for babies.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy dropped Owen off at Pac-North one day. He tried to take a picture of Allison but his phone storage was full. She told him to delete some stuff but he said he needed a bigger phone. He kissed her goodbye and went inside while she drove off to Grey Sloan.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref> Teddy took the day off to support Meredith on the day of her hearing before the medical commission. She and Owen entered the hotel arguing about sleep training, which all sources gave different advice on. Since she was suffering from severe cumulative sleep deprivation, she happily accepted Link's coffee. When [[Paul Castello]] had a seizure and was taken to Grey Sloan, Teddy and Link drove behind it. At the hospital, they took scans and diagnosed a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. Tom took on the case and started operating to evacuate the hemorrhage. Teddy sat with Amelia in the gallery until Link came in. After Paul died, the three of them drove back to the hotel, where they learned Meredith got to keep her license. Teddy congratulated her with the others and went back to work afterward.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie asked Teddy to scrub in with her for a valve replacement. While Teddy found it odd for such a basic procedure, she happily accepted the opportunity to operate on a non-traumatized heart for the first time in months. During surgery, Teddy talked about the work at Pac-North. Owen had shown her around there and asked her to come run cardio. She had been thinking about it because she was missing cardio and Maggie was doing a terrific job at it at Grey Sloan. Maggie then scolded her for chit-chatting. Near the end of the surgery, Tom complimented Teddy on her technique from the gallery. Once he was gone, Maggie wondered why Teddy didn't tell him to leave her alone. Teddy still felt guilty for breaking his heart and he was harmless. Maggie asked if she was sure because it seemed to her like Tom still thought he had a future with her and Teddy didn't seem to want to set the record straight. Teddy was then called away for a trauma in the pit but soon returned when Maggie was panicking over the fact that the patient's heart hadn't restarted yet after having taken him off bypass. Teddy pointed out it was likely hibernating myocardium and got Maggie to calm down and agree to her recommendation. After updating the patient's wife, Tom told Teddy he was in need of a new Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. She thought he had fired Maggie to give her what she wanted and finally told him she had really moved on from him. Tom informed her Maggie had actually quit herself and proceeded to point out that Owen still hadn't proposed to her while he had a baby with her, while Tom was ready to marry Teddy this very day. He asked if she really wanted to close the door on him and walked off, leaving her to overthink what he had said.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy was on duty in the ER when several of Grey Sloan's residents were brought in injured after a car crashed into Joe's bar. She and Amelia teamed up to treat Casey, who was experiencing a severe PTSD exacerbation but went missing on their watch. While they were looking for him, they came across Owen, who complained about Tom being an ass to him. Teddy asked him to cut Tom some slack. Teddy also vented to Amelia about Owen not having proposed yet. It made her wonder if her showing up pregnant with his child triggered his PTSD, which was rooted in a pattern of obligations and not wanting to disappoint people, and made him feel trapped with her. Amelia said she thought Owen was just trying to do things differently. She and Amelia found Casey in the hyperbaric chamber and took him the neuro ICU to monitor him. Teddy also performed an angio on [[Levi Schmitt]], who was experiencing heart attack-like symptoms but turned out to be suffering from broken heart syndrome. Afterward, Owen took Teddy to an on-call room and proposed. She stopped him mid-proposal and told him he didn't have to propose and she didn't want to reinforce his PTSD patterns. He said she wasn't and that he was starting a new pattern of loving her and their family with his whole heart. She then gladly accepted his proposal and they went out to cheer the news with some staff, including Amelia and Link, while a disdained Tom looked on from a distance.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Teddy lost the ring and she started looking around at work. When Owen dropped by for a surprise lunch to discuss wedding plans, she blurted out she had lost the ring and got emotional because she aware of the significance it had in his family. Owen told her not to worry and assured her they would find it. Owen took apart the sink pipes in the attendings' lounge as Teddy thought she may have lost it there, but it wasn't in there. They then received word that Leo was vomiting in daycare and went to check on him. They took an X-ray to be safe and discovered Leo had swallowed the ring. While they waited for Leo to pass it, Owen told her she could keep the ring stored somewhere and only wear it for special occasions and suggested she just wear a necklace with the first letter of each of their family members on it. When Leo finally pooped, Teddy volunteered to find the ring.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy took a leave of absence when the children got sick and ended up missing more work because she got the flu herself.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref><ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAs a snowstorm hit Seattle, Owen and Teddy dropped off the kids at his mother's. At work, Teddy grew suspicious when she found Amelia was on leave and there were troubles between her and Link. After working with Owen and Maggie to save a woman and her baby, Teddy walked out into the snow in the ambulance bay to quiet her mind. Tom joined her with hot cocoa. She opened up and told him she had been having this fear for months that Owen was the father of Amelia's baby and that she and Owen would never work out because he would always be in love with Amelia. Tom assured her that Owen was clearly in love with Teddy. Teddy told him he was a good man. Tom said that people were not letting him in no matter how hard he was trying. She repeated she liked him. They then had a snowball fight. Later, Teddy ran into Maggie and told her about her fear, asking if she was being crazy. Maggie told her she was not. Her fear amped up, Teddy went to Tom's hotel room and kissed him. She entered the room, not noticing Owen's text to ask her to go sledding with him.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen assures Teddy she is not a replacement.]]\nOwen started to plan their wedding and had his mom send him venue suggestions. He tried discussing it with Teddy in front of Tom but she brushed it off and suggested they get a wedding planner, which he turned down. Once Owen left, Teddy accused Tom of acting weird by being nice to Owen, which could lead to him finding out what happened between them. Tom said he wanted it to keep happening. Teddy insisted it hadn't meant anything and that she had been acting out of fear. Maggie interrupted their talk to discuss a patient but once Tom was gone, Teddy spilled her secret to Maggie. Later in the day, she tried to ignore Owen but ended up telling him that the baby might be his. She asked him what that would mean for them. He took a beat to answer, which upset her. Teddy later vented to Maggie and mentioned that Amelia was playing with people's feelings, which Maggie pointed out Teddy had done with her own pregnancy. Teddy apologized and went to find Tom in his office. She told him he made her feel good and in control, so she felt bad about hurting a good guy like him. While he disagreed on being a good guy, they ended up making out again. Afterward, Teddy went home and found Owen waiting for her with a home-cooked meal. He said he was just shocked when Teddy told him about Amelia's baby earlier. He assured her she was not a replacement and that he would always love her, no matter what.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Amelia informed all parties involved that Link was the father of the baby. In a supply closet, Teddy told Tom that the news hadn't changed the way she felt about him. Teddy and Amelia worked on [[Kyle Rexton]] together, which caused Amelia to wonder if love only meant sacrifice. Teddy thought so, stating she left behind her life in Germany for a marriage that only might work. Amelia reminded her again that Owen was not the father, but Teddy said that hypotheticals have consequences, too. While Amelia operated on Kyle, Tom sat with Teddy in the gallery and told her that he wouldn't be the man sleeping with a married woman. He wanted to make it easy for her so he told her to go home and be with Owen, adding that he would be fine. Teddy ended up crying on a bench outside, where Owen found her. She almost told him about Tom but then changed her mind, claiming she was crying over her rough day. He comforted her.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy attended the Surgical Innovation Conference. Happy to spend some time without her kids, she headed to heart valve happy hour. Over cocktails, she encouraged Maggie to get it on with an attractive [[Winston Ndugu|former colleague]] of hers, likening conferences to the Olympic village. Later, she had drinks with [[Cormac Hayes]] and witnessed how he lost his temper with a rep from a company. He then excused himself. While sitting at the bar by herself, she was surprised to see [[Claire (Love of My Life)|Claire]]. Claire sat down with her and they shared updates on their lives since /. They then touched upon Allison, whom Teddy said she missed every second of her life. Teddy then brought up her daughter. Claire found it odd for her to have named her daughter after Allison. Teddy claimed it wasn't odd to name your child after your deceased best friend, but Claire revealed she knew about their affair. Teddy said it tore them up. Claire said she requested Allison's phone records after she had died to imagine her in her last moment and she found out that Teddy was the last person Allison had tried to call as the Towers fell. Overwhelmed by emotion, Claire left the bar. Teddy met up with Maggie for breakfast the next morning. When she spotted Claire, she went to apologize for the affair and the lying. She stated she had come to learn that a person could love two people at once. Claire accepted her apology, saying she could never stay mad at someone for loving Allison. Afterward, Teddy attended Richard's talk on his PathPen, which turned into complete nonsense. Afraid that he was having a stroke, Teddy went to call an ambulance while Maggie got Richard off the stage.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy became part of the team trying to figure out what was going on with Richard. Between that and Tom, she forgot about wedding cake tasting with Owen. As she walked with Tom, who jokingly suggested for her not to marry Owen, they came across [[Dana Hamilton]], Tom's ex-wife, who wanted him to operate on her son, [[Guthrie Hamilton]], who bore a striking resemblance to Tom and Dana's deceased son David. Teddy figured the surgery to remove spinal mets was too much pressure for Tom so she paged Amelia to take over. Dana struggled to accept the change as she had absolute confidence in Tom's abilities. Tom, however, claimed his schedule was too busy rather than tell Dana the truth. Teddy checked in on Tom later. He told her that he had always convinced himself that he would have been able to save David if they had gotten to the hospital in time, but now that he had the opportunity to save someone who looked so much like David, he couldn't even stand to be in the same room, meaning the thought that he could have saved David had just been a lie. During the surgery, Amelia started experiencing contractions so Tom was forced to step in. He froze right after taking over so Teddy coached him from the gallery to find his confidence again. [[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy comforts Tom.]] Tom pulled off the surgery and retreated to his office afterward, where Teddy came to find him. He thanked her for what she had done for him that day. She apologized for causing him pain but he said she had taken away more than she was adding. She briefly held his hand until she pulled away and left. She ran into Owen on her way out. He pulled her into a supply closet and they started to make out. Trying to bury her feelings for Tom, she asked Owen to get married that very weekend.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy didn't tell Tom, who was hurt upon finding out the truth when Owen confronted him about not granting him time off. He feigned happiness for her. Later, they ended up on an elevator together and he brought up her wedding. She stated she loved Owen and didn't want to discuss it any further. He guessed moving up the wedding was her way of trying to convince herself she could live without him. Teddy responded that the wedding was happening but Tom openly doubted that. Teddy answered a page from Tom, who asked her not to throw her life away. She still insisted the wedding was happening. Tom told her he still loved her and wouldn't give up on her. He told her he would wait for her in the parking lot at  o'clock, ready to take her wherever she wanted to go. Teddy objected but gave in as Tom started kissing her, which brought her to finally confess that she was in love with Tom, too. Unbeknownst to Teddy, she accidentally called Owen, leaving him a voice mail message of her and Tom having sex. While doing so, Teddy told Tom that this was goodbye and that she would still be marrying Owen. She went home and put on her dress for the wedding, but as she went to the living room for the ceremony, she found Evelyn taking down decorations. Teddy was surprised when Evelyn told her that Owen had called to inform her he got pulled into a last minute surgery and that the wedding would have to be postponed.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nOwen and Teddy met while they both were army surgeons. Owen brought her to Seattle Grace Mercy West as a present for [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], claiming her to be a \"cardio goddess\", and Teddy later worked out that Owen brought her as a present for his girlfriend, appearing more surprised by the fact Cristina was his girlfriend. She later would admit that she believed that if Owen broke up with his fianc\uee, Beth, he would have called her. She knew what Owen was going through with his PTSD, but she wasn't able to help him because she was seeing Mark at the time, and he was with Cristina. During the shooting, Owen finally decided that he wanted to be with Cristina, which Teddy understood. This ended their romantic feelings for one another, and they continued being best friends.\n\nYears after Teddy left the hospital to move to Germany, Owen realized that he wanted to be with her and flew out to Germany to visit her. They slept together and spent a day blissfully happy. However, their happiness was cut short when Teddy learned that Owen had come because of Amelia's suggestion after he had slept with Amelia the day before. Teddy kicked Owen out, and two left things on bad terms.\n\nMonths later, Teddy returned to Seattle with the news that she was pregnant with Owen's baby. Though Owen was initially mad that Teddy had hid her pregnancy from him for so long, they eventually made up and decided to raise the baby as friends. After Owen broke up with Amelia again, he started therapy and realized he was actually in love with Teddy. Teddy realized that she was also in love with Owen just as she went into labor with their baby. As she was giving birth to their daughter, [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], Owen declared his love for her. After a few months of raising Allison together, Owen proposed to Teddy with his mother's ring and she accepted. During the snowstorm, Teddy and\ua[[Tom Koracick]]\uaslept together. They slept together and had a romantic relationship for weeks leading up to the wedding of Owen and Teddy. Owen finally found out after Teddy dropped her phone in Tom's office and a voicemail of Teddy moaning was heard by the OR. Owen later listened to the voicemail in full and cried in a supply closet. He called off the wedding.\n\nWhile Teddy was dealing her trauma and loss of Allison, Owen apologized to her for the way he treated her when she tried to tell him the truth about her relationship with Allison. They reconcile as friends.\n\nLater on Christmas, Owen proposes to Teddy again and she accepts.\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nDr. Sloan asked Teddy out, but she initially declined. Eventually, she accepted and they had dated briefly.\uaAfter finding [[Reed Adamson]] in Mark's bed, Teddy ended things.<ref>[[Shiny Happy People]], x</ref>\n\n[[Henry Burton]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Teddy realizes she loves Henry.]]Henry was a patient who had Von Hippel-Lindau disease (making tumors grow in areas with rich blood supply) and could no longer afford treatment because his insurance capped out. Teddy met Henry in an elevator in the hospital, where Henry asked her if he would have a chance when he asked his girlfriend to marry him. Teddy told him his girlfriend would be a fool to say no. She later bumped into him again, and he informed her his girlfriend said no. He then revealed that he primarily asked her because of her insurance. Teddy then offered to marry him, as she had a great insurance as a surgeon.\n\nAfter their marriage, Henry listed Teddy as his emergency contact person, because he didn't have any friends or family left. Henry developed real feelings for Teddy, but he decided not to tell her. She started dating, and they discussed her dates over the food she always brought home for him. However, when Teddy started a relationship with [[Andrew Perkins]] for the second time, Henry couldn't keep his feeling still anymore. He told her how he felt, which made her doubt about her relationship with Andrew. Right before she would leave for Germany with Perkins, she choose Henry over Andrew and kissed Henry.\n\nHenry told Teddy that he wanted to go to medical school, but Teddy didn't want him to go. When Teddy went home that night, she tried to make up with Henry, but found him coughing up blood. Henry had a tumor on his lung and needed surgery. When Cristina and Richard opened him up, they found that there was no chance of saving Henry and he started to code. Webber stepped in to do CPR, but after  minutes, it was a lost cause so he stopped and Henry died. Webber told Owen not to tell Teddy as she was in surgery, and then they would lose another patient, so Owen told Teddy that Henry survived. Finally, after the surgery, Cristina told her that her husband was dead. Teddy demanded to see him and then broke down in tears.\n\n[[Andrew Perkins]]\nAndrew and Teddy began a relationship after the shooting at Seattle Grace Mercy West. Andrew was the main trauma counselor who had to approve and clear each surgeon for surgery. Teddy and Andrew met in the\uacafeteria and dated for a few weeks before he had to move onto his next case. Teddy was very upset by this, but eventually moved on. Eventually, Andrew returned to Seattle, but in the meantime, Teddy had married\ua[[Henry Burton|Henry]]. Andrew was offered a permanent position in Germany and asked Teddy to go with him. She initially accepted and they were all set to go. However, she had second thoughts about her relationship with Henry and chose to stay.\n\n[[Tom Koracick]]\nTom and Teddy started dating after she came back to Seattle to raise her child with Owen. Though Tom initially had worries about Teddy's relationship with Owen, she convinced him that she and Owen were only meant to be friends. Tom stayed very involved with Teddy's pregnancy, including attending birthing classes with her. Tom even helped Teddy find the perfect apartment in Seattle. Tom often fought with Owen over Teddy, as both men wanted to help Teddy with her pregnancy. When Teddy went into labor and had an emotional moment with Owen, Tom was not alerted and was left at home building a crib for the baby.\n\nShe broke up with him after giving birth and chose Owen. Later on, despite being engaged to Owen, Teddy had a playful snowball fight with Tom and went to his house that night. They kissed and shut the door. Later, they kissed and locked the door again in Tom's office.\n\n[[Allison Robin Brown]]\nTeddy met Allison when Allison nearly ran her over with her bike. They hit it off and Allison bought Teddy a bagel and asked Teddy to move in with Allison and Allison's girlfriend, [[Claire (Love of My Life)|Claire]], but she and Allison began an affair together after that, whilst Teddy was grieving the loss of her mother.\uaTeddy later described\uaAllison as her\ua\"favorite person.\" Allison died on / in the second tower and her death left Teddy feeling like she couldn't stay in New York. She ended up joining the Army because of that feeling. Years later, Teddy and Owen named their daughter after Allison.\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nOne day, Arizona took Teddy aside and told her that they should be friends. Teddy and Arizona shared a special friendship. When [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] asked Teddy out, she confided in Arizona, who suggested that Mark was like candy: eat it and forget about it. When things sparked between Mark and Teddy, Arizona was the one she confided in. When Arizona went to Africa, she and Teddy continued to keep in touch and regularly wrote to each other. Arizona supported Teddy when she had things going on between her and [[Andrew Perkins|Andrew]].\n\nWhen [[Callie Torres|Callie]] became pregnant and asked Arizona to be in, Arizona went to Teddy for advice on whether or not to be in. Arizona arranged ladies night for her after Henry died. Arizona and Teddy continued to keep in touch after Teddy moved to Germany, as Arizona learned about Owen double-dipping from her phone conversation with Teddy. \n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nInitially excited at the prospect of a new cardio attending, Cristina was disappointed when she learned that Teddy had not inserted a pacing wire for about  years and began to question Teddy's skills as a surgeon.\n\nHowever she became very impressed by Dr. Altman soon after Teddy diagnosed a child with cardiac asthma after only a brief exam and asking three questions, and when she opened him up, she discovered he had a coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula, which she repaired surgically and allowed Cristina to first assist, which meant allowing her to attach the coronary artery to the aorta. Following his removal from bypass, the patient went into v-fib and started bleeding from the repair site. Teddy remained extremely calm and talked Cristina through resolving the rhythm and repairing the site without rearresting the heart.\n\nOver the course of their time together, Teddy and Cristina developed a deep sense of respect for each other as colleagues, despite the slight tension between them caused by Owen. Teddy, who grew to appreciate Cristina's skills and persistence, almost regularly had Cristina on her service.\n\nThey once performed an appendectomy together, during which both of them forgot what to do halfway through the surgery. Cristina told Meredith and Alex that Teddy is\ua\"the love of my life\" because they got along so well.\n\nWhen Teddy's husband, [[Henry Burton|Henry]], came to the ER while vomiting blood, he had to undergo laparoscopic surgery, and Teddy believed only Cristina could perform the surgery like herself. Cristina was kept in the dark about the identity of the patient, and she performed the surgery. At one point in the surgery, there was too much bleeding, and Dr. Webber suggested they open him up. After they opened him up, Cristina saw there was too much damage to the aorta\uaand realized she couldn't do anything to save him. Dr. Webber continued to do compressions even after Henry's heart stopped. Cristina was then told by Owen about who the patient was and she broke down crying in the scrub room.\n\nNot long after that, she was forced to enter the ER where Teddy was operating to assist in that surgery. Teddy was unaware that Henry had died. After the surgery was complete, Cristina had [[April Kepner|April]] close while she took Teddy into the scrub room and told her that Henry had died.\ua[[This Magic Moment|For two weeks]] after Henry's death, Teddy questioned Cristina over and over again about what exactly happened in the surgery. Cristina kept describing the whole procedure without complaining, until Teddy concluded that Cristina did everything that could have been done.\n\n\nDr. Altman attended [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School]], completing her [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[George Washington University Medical Center]] and her fellowship at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Florida.\n\nWorking previously at [[Columbia University Medical Center]]\uaas a [[Board Certification#American Board of Thoracic Surgery|board certified]] [[Attending|attending surgeon]], Dr. Altman left her job following the death of her best friend, who was killed during the collapse of the second tower. Upon leaving her job, Dr. Altman joined the army and met [[Owen Hunt]] during her tour in Baghdad. She also served two years in Landstuhl.\n\nWhen her tour of duty was over, Owen recommended her as the new interim [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. The then-[[Chief of Surgery|Chief]], [[Richard Webber|Webber]] initially offered her a temporary contract, but she became part of the permanent staff when Dr. [[Derek Shepherd|Shepherd]], the new chief of surgery, extended her offer with a new contract.\n\nAs head of cardiothoracic surgery, Dr. Altman mentored [[Cristina Yang]] for the last three years of Yang's residency and began research on a stem cell regenerative heart medicine project. It was this research that drew the US Army Medical Command's attention toward Dr. Altman, eventually offering her the position as their [[Chief of Staff|chief of staff]]. After Chief Hunt fired her in order to facilitate the decision of leaving for her, she left the hospital and accepted the position at MEDCOM.\n\nShe came to\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]\uaafter\ua[[Megan Hunt]]\uawas found. Teddy now\uaholds privileges at the hospital since operating on Megan\uawith\ua[[Meredith Grey]]. After finding out she was pregnant, Teddy traveled to Seattle again and was pulled into an emergency surgery with Bailey, whom she asked for a job. Surprisingly, Bailey offered her the job of [[Chief of Surgery|Interim Chief of Surgery]], which Teddy was very interested in. However, she later turned it down after learning that Owen had formed a family with Amelia. Later, after she told Owen and decided to remain in Seattle so their baby could have two parents, Owen gave her his job as Head of Trauma Surgery. She began missing operating on non-traumatized hearts and was hired as Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery again by [[Tom Koracick]] when [[Maggie Pierce]] quit. Shortly after, [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] was closed down and Maggie was re-hired at Grey Sloan, making her and Teddy Co-Heads of the department.\n\n\n*Teddy has birds on her scrub cap. Owen revealed that Teddy's best friend loved birds and died during the collapse of the second World Trade Center tower.\n*She drives a Volvo V\n*Teddy was awarded a Bronze Star for her service in the military.\n*Teddy had plans to leave the hospital every season during her first run as a main cast member, finally leaving at the end of season eight.\n**In [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season six]], she almost left because she couldn't handle that Owen wasn't in love with her.\n**In [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season seven]], she was planning on moving to Germany with Andrew Perkins, but stayed because Henry told her he was in love with her and she was starting to fall in love with him too.\n**In the [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season eight]] finale, she was offered a job in the army, but refused to take it because she wanted to stay in Seattle to support Owen, as he was having a hard time. However, Owen didn't want her to miss the opportunity just because of him, and forced himself to fire her. After she was fired, Teddy was angry at first but relieved later, and she took the job, leaving Seattle Grace Mercy West.\n*Though she was part of the main cast from season six to season eight, and seasons fifteen to present, season seven is the only season in which she appears in every single episode.\n*Teddy is either bisexual or pansexual, since she got involved with her friend, [[Allison Robin Brown|Allison]].\n*Although the cardiothoracic surgery department has had more different department heads than any other department over the course of the entire series, Teddy is the only head of cardiothoracic surgery to have been fired. It should be noted though that she wasn't fired for performance reasons, but rather as an incentive to take a post at MEDCOM.\n*Teddy was unable to complete an appendectomy without [[Nurse Linda]] reminding her of the remaining steps of the procedure.\n*Out of all the season six main cast members, Teddy was the only one who didn't encounter Gary Clark while he went on a shooting rampage at the hospital.\n*Teddy loves dogs, especially puppies.\n*She hates the word moist.

She had no pulse. In the ER, [[Cristina Yang]] relieved a tension pneumothorax and then [[Erica Hahn]] took over and took Teresa for a CT. Teresa has multiple broken ribs and a hemothorax, so she was taken into surgery. She survived the surgery and then made it through the night.\n\nIn the morning, Lexie brought the baby in to see them, but Teresa's heart stopped and the baby was sent back while they got her heart started again. Her other lung was leaking, but they couldn't operate because her heart couldn't take the strain.\n\nKnowing she wouldn't make it another day without surgery, they put her on a heart-lung machine in her room so she could be transported to the OR for surgery. They found a hole in her remaining lung and patched it. They were hoping it would hold and that was the only tear. When they checked, they found another leak. They tried to repair the damage, but they were unable to and Teresa died in the OR.\n\n\n\nShe was married to [[Sean Brotherton]] until her death.\n\n\nShe and Sean adopted a baby girl.

They started searching for a bone marrow donor, but ethnic donors are scarce, so they were never able to find one. However, they were able to treat his condition with enzyme injections. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\n\nBraden's parents brought him into the GSM ER when he became congested. He was given antibiotics and IVIG to treat the sinusitis. However, he also had a bump on his forehead which he thought was a zit but was actually a Pott's Puffy Tumor. He was taken in to surgery to have it drained. In surgery, the doctors noted cerebral spinal fluid, meaning that the abscess had penetrated his brain, meaning they needed to call in Dr. Shepherd. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\n\nAfter surgery, Braden was put into an isolation room because the enzyme injections had stopped working, leaving him vulnerable to infection. He woke up and was scared when he saw where he was. His parents assured him through the plastic barrier that they weren\ut leaving him and they love him. ''(\"[[You Be Illin']]\")''\n\nTwo weeks post-up, Braden's infection had cleared up. However, his T-cell count was still zero, so he had to remain in isolation. He used a remote control car to break through the plastic and escape to play tag, but he was quickly found and taken back into isolation. ''(\"[[I'm Winning]]\")''\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]] had the idea to use deactivated HIV to deliver the enzyme to Braden's body. His parents were initially concerned about the use of HIV, but Dr. Bailey assured them that she was not going to give Braden HIV. ''(\"[[Go It Alone]]\")''\n\nAfter receiving chemotherapy to kill off the enzyme-deficient bone marrow, Braden contracted a viral infection, concerning his parents. Worried that the treatment would make Braden even sicker, Teresa withdrew consent for the gene therapy. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morrises, Bailey proceeded with the gene therapy as planned. It went well and Braden's T-cell count was up to . He beat the infection and was able to start eating solid food again. ''(\"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the treatment, Braden improved enough that Bailey felt comfortable discharging him. However, before she could do that, she had to inform his parents that she had gone ahead with the treatment. When she told them, they began to doubt the results. They also decided the press charges against Bailey for assault and battery. Owen and Jackson were able to assure them that the results were as she said they were, but not to drop the charges.\n\nStephanie Edwards lied and told them that she had forgotten to tell Bailey that they had withdrawn consent and it was entirely her fault. That still didn't convince them until they held their son and they agreed to drop the charges in exchange for Dr. Edwards being suspended for a week. ''(\"[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]]\")''\n\n\nAfter being discharged, Braden had a follow-up with his pediatrician and he was very healthy.
