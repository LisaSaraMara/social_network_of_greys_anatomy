Like I'm damaged goods. I'm still me. I'm still here.|'''Adele Webber''' to '''[[Richard Webber]]'''}}\n\n'''Adele Webber''' was the wife of\ua[[Richard Webber]]. She had Alzheimer's and died of a heart attack after surgery.\ua\n\n\n\nAfter the surgery to remove Richard's brain tumor, Derek called Adele to inform her about it, as Richard hadn't told her himself. Derek did it because having someone at home with him was the only way he was allowing Richard to leave the hospital, and so Adele ditched her trip to the Virgin Island to take care of her husband. When she came to the hospital to visit him, Addison stopped by too. Adele told them that she knew they'd get back together, but Derek denied this, saying he and Addison were over. ''(\"[[Enough is Enough]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Richard was dealing with the bomb scare at the hospital, he had what looked like a heart attack, so his wife was called. She refused to let him get out of bed and go back to work. ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n\nAdele was chaperoning [[Camille Travis|Camille's]] prom when Camille passed out while having sex. Adele came into the ER with her, where Addison broke the news to her that Camille's ovarian cancer had returned. When Richard sent her friends away, Adele yelled at him, saying he needed to make it up to Camille and put their family ahead of the hospital. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\n\nAdele made an appointment to see her husband, knowing that's the only way she'd get some time with him. She was very upset when he left during their meeting time to deal with a hospital issue. When he returned later, she said it was time for him to retire, to choose her over the hospital. She was upset when he wanted time to think about it, saying she didn't have any more time to give. ''(\"[[Time Has Come Today]]\")''\n\nRichard later decided he was going to step down. He told the board and came to Adele's with flowers. However, she said she'd told him months ago she didn't have any more time to give, and Richard realized she had begun\uaseeing someone else. She told him she was sorry, but wondered what he expected. ''(\"[[Great Expectations]]\")''\n\n\nAdele came into the ER after being in a minor car accident. While she was being examined, she confessed to Addison that she was pregnant. She had some spotting, so Addison wanted to keep her overnight for observation, but Adele later passed out in a bathroom with vaginal bleeding. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nShe was taken to the ER, where Addison examined her. Addison told Richard that Adele might be having a miscarriage. When Adele woke up, Addison did an ultrasound and was able to find a fetal heartbeat, though it was slow. She gave her a transfusion and fluids in the hopes it would help. However, Adele was later rushed to the OR. Addison did what she could, but she was unable to save the pregnancy. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\nAfter her miscarriage, she still wouldn't allow Richard to move back in and wasn't returning his calls. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nAdele came into the ER with Camille, who was unable to breathe. When they found out that her cancer had spread, Camille said she wanted to die, but Adele and Arlene begged Richard to convince her to have more treatment. He planned to, but backed off when he saw how tired and worn down Camille was. Adele was upset, saying she'd already lost one baby and now was losing another. Richard told her that she couldn't use Camille to make up for the fact that they never had children. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nWhen several of the nurses complained about [[Mark Sloan]], Adele was brought on as a nurse mediator and worked with [[Wayne Sheehan]] to develop a [[Date and Tell]] policy to protect the hospital from potential litigation. She'd taken the job so that she could feel important. ''(\"[[The Becoming]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Bailey decided to go into pediatric surgery, Richard became upset with her. As a result, Bailey called in Adele, who yelled at both of them. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nAdele came into the hospital worried because Richard hadn't come home the night before and hadn't called. She thought something might have happened to him. When she saw the way Bailey interacted with Richard, she asked if they were having an affair. Bailey vehemently denied it, but Adele was still convinced he was having an affair with someone. ''(\"[[New History]]\")''\n\n\nAdele came into the hospital with a broken wrist and was confused about the events that led up to her fall. Meredith ran a CT, suspecting a head injury. The CT was clean, so Meredith suggested that Adele might have Alzheimer's. Richard flatly rejected the idea and took Adele home. ''(\"[[Golden Hour]]\")''\n\nShortly after that, Adele came into the hospital after a second accident. She claimed she fell due to the shoes she was wearing, but Richard was concerned and asked Bailey to run tests to try to figure out the cause of her falls. Her tests showed nothing physically wrong with her, so Bailey told Richard he should get Derek to check Adele out. He then asked Derek to examine her. ''(\"[[Not Responsible]]\")''\n\nDerek ran some tests and diagnosed Adele with Alzheimer's. Richard begged Derek to include Adele in his Alzheimer's trial, though Derek said the trial and the waiting list were both full, plus they didn't even know if she fit the criteria for the trial. When [[Sonya Amin]] dropped out of the trial, Derek agreed to screen Adele for his trial. She scored one point too high to qualify, but still had Alzheimer's. ''(\"[[This is How We Do It]]\")''\n\nAfter seeing a post-it that had fallen off Richard's sweater that labelled him as Adele's husband, Meredith figured out that Adele's condition had quickly gotten worse. After a clinical trial patient died, they re-tested her and found that she met the criteria for the trial. After Meredith spoke with Adele and Adele mistook her for Ellis, Meredith realized how much worse she'd gotten. She joined the trial and had her surgery. After Richard told her that all he wanted was to be with Adele, Meredith went into the pharmacy where the packets were being kept and after finding out that Adele was designated to get the placebo, she switched the packet with another one so she'd get the active agent. ''(\"[[It's a Long Way Back]]\")''\n\nOn the day Richard performed his ,th surgery, Adele tried to walk to the hospital to find Richard. Their neighbor, [[Mrs. Vanderburg]], found her and drove her the rest of the way. Once at the hospital, she demanded to see Richard. April took her to the gallery so she could see him operate, where she saw Meredith operating with him and believed it was Ellis. When she started to yell, Meredith suggested that Richard use a happy memory to try grounding her, something that worked with Ellis. He started singing their wedding song, My Funny Valentine, to her and she sang along. He then took her home and put her to bed. ''(\"[[Hope for the Hopeless]]\")''\n\nOne morning, Richard woke up to find that Adele had started a fire in her confusion. He was burned trying to put the fire out. This incident made him realize Adele might need more care than he could give and they toured [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]] together. She said that he had promised to buy her a house, confused about what they were doing there and he decided to take her home. When she later saw that she had gotten confused and thrown things at a nurse and then at Richard, she asked him if she had Alzheimer's. She then said that Roseridge seemed like a nice place and they agreed that she'd go there. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\nAt the home, her condition continued to deteriorate and she developed a romantic relationship with [[Allan (Grey's Anatomy)|Allan]], another resident with dementia. When Richard found them in bed together, he asked that she be moved to another room. In the new room, she was upset and asked about Allan, unable to remember Richard, even after he sang My Funny Valentine to her. After realizing that his presence was doing more harm than good, Richard left and allowed Allan to take his seat. ''(\"[[The Girl with No Name]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Richard and Bailey were being driven to Bailey's wedding in a limo, Richard got a phone call from the hospital. They informed him that Adele was coming to the ER. Bailey then ordered the limo driver to take them to the hospital immediately. Right after her arrival, she started to take care of Adele. Richard wanted to do it at first, but he wasn't allowed because he was a family member. ''(\"[[Run, Baby, Run]]\")''\n\nBailey postponed her wedding, which led to Meredith coming back to the hospital to take over from Bailey. However, Bailey didn't want to leave Adele and they operated on her together. During surgery, they ran out of options, but Richard came with an idea that they used to successfully fix the aneurysm.\n\nAfter surgery, Adele woke up. Richard stayed with her and Meredith and Bailey returned to the wedding. However, when Richard eventually showed up at the wedding as well, Meredith knew something was wrong with Adele. Richard told her she died of a heart attack because the surgery was too much for her heart. ''(\"[[Things We Said Today]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nAdele married Richard Webber when she was . She always knew about his affair with [[Ellis Grey]] but didn't leave him as she loved him and knew he would eventually end it, but she had finally had enough when Richard put his other hospital patients above her dying niece.\n\nWhen Richard failed to return home on the night of the prom, she made an appointment to see him at the office, but was blown off because of another hospital emergency. It proved one too many, however, and she gave him an ultimatum: her or the hospital. Richard tried to avoid making the choice, but Adele was tired of his indecision, and left him.\n\nWhen Dr. Richard Webber quit his job as the Chief of Surgery, he returned to Adele to find out that she had moved on and appeared to be involved with another man. She is in the process of divorcing Richard when she is involved in a small car accident, and is hospitalized. She reveals to Addison that she is pregnant. After being released, she faints in a bathroom and is found by Richard. It is discovered that she is having complications with the pregnancy and will have to undergo surgery. Despite the fact that he believes that he is not the baby's father, Dr. Webber stays at his wife's side even when she tells him to leave her be. This support eventually brings them back together. After the surgery, Adele loses the baby and tells Richard that the baby was indeed his and that there was never any other man in her life.\n\nWhen Richard showed Adele that he was spending fewer hours at work and had even gotten himself an intern, they spent the night together. ''(\"[[The Becoming]]\")''\n\nHe later told Adele he wanted to come home and she said it was about time. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nTheir relationship remained steady until Adele started to deteriorate due to Alzheimer's disease. It eventually led to her death when she developed a large aneurysm and then died of a heart attack after her surgery. ''(\"[[Things We Said Today]]\")''\n\n[[Allan (Grey's Anatomy)|Allan]]\nWhile Adele is in the Roseridge Home for Extended Care, she meets Allan, another man who also has Alzheimer's. Since she doesn't remember Richard, she falls in love with Allan and they begin a physical and emotional relationship. ''(\"[[The Girl with No Name]]\")''\n\n\nAdele used to be a nurse for thirty years at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], where her husband [[Richard Webber|Richard]] worked. Some time after she retired, she was brought on as a nurse mediator and worked with [[Wayne Sheehan]] to develop a [[Date and Tell]] policy to protect the hospital from potential litigation.\n\n\n*She lost her virginity at the age of , but doesn't remember much about it.<ref>[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]], x</ref>\n*She loved mystery book series.<ref>[[If Only You Were Lonely]], x</ref>\n*She was married to Richard for  years.\n*She attended the wedding of a young [[Miranda Bailey]] and [[Tucker Jones]] with her husband, Richard. ''(\"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\")'' Bailey was a \"child\" when she married Tucker, according to her husband, implying they married very young. ''(\"[[Run, Baby, Run]]\")'' Webber also got the couple a set of ramekins for the wedding. It is unknown how Adele or Webber knew Bailey or Tucker as a couple or one or the other as individuals prior to her internship.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Enough is Enough]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[As We Know It]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Time Has Come Today]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Great Expectations]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Testing --]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[The Becoming]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Freedom, Part ]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[New History]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[Golden Hour]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Not Responsible]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[This is How We Do It]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[It's a Long Way Back]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[Hope for the Hopeless]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[If/Then]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\nAdeleWebber.png|[[The Girl with No Name]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[Run, Baby, Run]]\nxAdeleWebber.png|[[Things We Said Today]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n-.jpg\n-.jpg\n-.jpg\n-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.png\nx-.jpg\nx-.png\nx-.jpg\nx-.png\nx-.png\nx-.png\nx-.png\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Adele Webber Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Adele Webber]]\n[[fr:Adele Webber]]\n[[es:Adele Webber]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Webber, Adele}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Nurses]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

But she believed it was more, because Andy was falling down on the soccer field. So she took him to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], where [[Arizona Robbins]] examined him. After talking through it with [[Miranda Bailey]], Arizona said that he had a mild case of scoliosis and his growth was likely aggravating his spine. She said they'd wait to see if it resolved and if it didn't, he'd come back in for more tests. In the meantime, she gave him a prescription for muscle relaxants.\n\nHe later came back to the hospital with serious pain in his inguinal area, legs, and back. He'd been vomiting all night. Arizona wanted to run a D MRI, but his mother's insurance wouldn't pay for it, so [[Richard Webber|Webber]] wouldn't let her run it, so she was forced to discharge him and refer him back to his primary care physician.

He witnessed his daughter's birth, but Mindy became unstable shortly after she was born and the baby was cyanotic and had to be taken to the NICU.\n\nBryan was later told that his wife's surgery was finished, but she was still in critical condition. He was then taken to his daughter's bedside, where he was told that her surgery, to repair a diaphragmatic hernia, had gone well and she'd be okay.\n\n\n\nHe is married to [[Mindy Wallace]].\n\n\nHe and his wife have a daughter.\n\n\n*He gets squeamish.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wallace, Bryan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She was married to [[George O'Malley]], but divorced after he cheated on her. She currently resides in New York with ex-wife [[Arizona Robbins]], with whom she has a daughter, [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]].\n\n\n\nCallie grew up in southern Florida. She was one of two daughters in a wealthy family, a fact she doesn't like to share with significant others. She has stated that \"four years of high school, four years of college, four years of medical school\" makes doctors socially inept at times. She has described herself as \"a total freak,\" and \"I'm that girl in the back of the class who eats her hair.\" She had also admitted to Arizona Robbins that she was in the Peace Corps in Botswana, and that is what had convinced her to go to medical school.\n\nCallie attended her high school prom by herself because she didn't want to wait for \"a stupid boy\" to ask her out. She picked out the sexiest dress, which was red. She made a fashionably late entrance and began to dance. She especially liked the part of prom where everybody else's dates tried to hit on her.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\n\nCallie met George when she reduced his dislocated shoulder. While having a short conversation, George told her he was single. Later that night, Callie ran into George outside the hospital and wrote her phone number on his hand, clearly showing interest in him.<ref>[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, George said that he called a few times but hung up every time. During their short conversation, George admitted that she made him a little nervous, which she thought was good. She then invited him to assist her on a cool ortho case. Before the surgery on the patient, she told him the ball was in his court as that was the last invitation she was giving him.<ref>[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, George didn't call her, so Callie started to ignore him. He realized the same that he should've called her, so while she was working in the ER and he was standing in the same room, he did call her. He said he should've called sooner and asked her out.<ref>[[Superstition]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after, Callie got to know George's friends. Callie came over to Burke's apartment (as George temporarily lived there) and she, George, Burke and Cristina played a game in teams. In the hospital, Izzie and Meredith assisted her on an ortho case. Izzie asked her a lot of questions, and Callie confessed she saw more in George than they did. George also discovered Callie lived in the hospital basement. There, she cut his hair, as he tried to do it himself earlier but totally messed it up, and they shared their first kiss.<ref>[[The Name of the Game]], x</ref>\n\nThe two also had sex for the first time. They decided to spend the next night at Meredith's. Izzie did not welcome Callie and was upset that George had brought her to their house.<ref>[[Blues for Sister Someone]], x</ref>\n\nAfter having spent the night at Meredith's, Callie went to the bathroom naked while Izzie and Meredith were there. She left without having washed her hands in the bathroom, leading to Izzie and Meredith making mean comments about her. However, unbeknownst to them and George, she did wash her hands downstairs in the kitchen. George later asked her if she did wash her hands, which angered Callie because she thought he chose Izzie's side. In the basement, Callie told George she washed her hands in the kitchen and not in the bathroom because Izzie and Meredith were staring at her in the bathroom, which made her feel uncomfortable. She said George had to stand up for her, and George apologized.<ref>[[Damage Case]], x</ref>\n[[File:xGeorgeandCallie.jpg|thumb|xpx|George and Callie kiss]]\nLater, in Joe's bar, it was clear Cristina, Meredith, and especially Izzie still didn't like Callie. When George came over to them, they greeted him exuberantly, while they only greeted her shortly. The following day, Meredith was on Callie's service and seemed to like her a little more. She asked Callie if she could ask something about bone cancer in her dog, but Callie turned her down. George later told her that he got why she asked her, as Doc really meant a lot to Meredith. Callie was surprised George defended her as Meredith really hurt him, but George said it was normal for him to forgive her as they were family, and he suggested Callie did the same. So she paged Meredith to a room to show her scans of a human with bone cancer, and explained some more to her about the disease. Meredith honestly thanked Callie for that. Later that day, Callie told George that she loved him, when suddenly Izzie came in, saying she really needed George's help. George left with Izzie, saying he'd call Callie.<ref>[[ Seconds]], x</ref>\n\nCallie later asked George what happened, but he didn't want to tell her. Therefore, she said no when he asked her to go to the prom with him. Later that day, when he saw her in a dress, he was surprised because he thought she wasn't going to the prom, but she said that she didn't want to go with him, because he avoided her after she said that she loved him. Callie wanted him to say that he loved her to prove that he wasn't avoiding her, but George said if he told her that, it was only because she wanted him to, and not because he really meant it. They kissed to make up.\n\nA nurse asked Callie to go find Meredith because there was something going on with Izzie. She walked in on Meredith and Derek, who just had sex. Callie was in the room where the other interns discovered that Izzie was lying in bed with a deceased Denny.<ref>[[Losing My Religion]], x</ref>\n\nThe day after the prom, Callie came over to Meredith's house with food, because she was worrying about Izzie. When Meredith let her in, Callie assured her that she wouldn't say anything about Meredith having sex with Derek, saying she wasn't that kind of person. Because of that, Meredith opened up to Callie about things that she doesn't tell everyone. While Callie was cooking, Meredith told her that she had no idea what to say to Izzie, who was lying on the bathroom floor. When Meredith left the kitchen because Finn Dandridge, Meredith's boyfriend came to visit, Callie told him that doctors are just socially retarded. She said that she was in love with a guy and cooking in his kitchen, hoping for him to come home and notice her. They ate together, but Callie left when Meredith came back, so that Finn and Meredith could have a conversation. When George finally came home that night, Callie hugged him and told him that she really, really loved him.<ref>[[Time Has Come Today]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:xCallieCaught.png|px|thumb|left|Callie is caught in her underwear by Richard ]]\nWhen Addison hung Meredith's panties, which she found in Derek's pocket, up on the bulletin board, Callie came to the rescue and claimed them, apologizing for leaving her underwear lying around again. George was later asking how it was possible that her panties were up on the bulletin board, and he questioned if it really were hers, as he had never seen them before. When Meredith came to tell her that she would tell the truth to George about the panties, Callie told her not to because she liked the fact that he was jealous. In the ER, Alex asked Callie how her relationship with George could've happened. Before having given a proper answer, Bailey interfered, saying that she outranked him, as she was a resident. Later that day, while she was dancing in her underwear, Richard discovered that she had been living in the hospital basement. He stayed there to talk with her over a cup of coffee, but he had to throw her out, as living in the hospital was against the rules. While they were talking, George came in, saying that he was jealous and didn't want other guys to touch her panties. He then noticed that the Chief was there, and left awkwardly. Callie then put her pants on, packed all her stuff, and said to George, who had been lying on a bench in front of the hospital ever since he left the hospital, that they weren't her panties. She also told him that the jealousy was insanely hot. George then noticed her suitcase and asked her to move in with him at Meredith's.<ref>[[I Am a Tree]], x</ref>\n\nAfter more than a week, George wanted Meredith to kick Callie out, because she was using all of his stuff. When she asked for a key, George said it wasn't necessary because he liked leaving the hospital together. During an argument over a patient's surgery, George said that everything went to fast and that he wasn't ready for her to move in. She then moved out and checked into a luxurious hotel.<ref>[[Sometimes a Fantasy]], x</ref>\n\nCallie was mad at him for saying to Meredith and Izzie how he felt, and not to her. He said that he missed her, which charmed Callie. When they crossed each other in the hospital, she invited him to come over to her hotel room and have dinner there. However, in the evening, George told her that he had to go home because there was something going on with Izzie. She then questioned his feelings for her, and it turned that he didn't even know what he was feeling himself. Callie then told him not to even bother trying to figure it out, and broke up with him. She went to Joe's bar and met Mark Sloan. Mark asked what she'd heard about him, and she replied that most things involved the words \"dirty\" and \"bad\". Callie then left the bar to go to her hotel, and asked him to come with her.<ref>[[What I Am]], x</ref>\n\nThe morning after, George tried to call Callie. She was still lying in bed with Mark and didn't answer her phone. That day at work, Callie avoided George. She confessed to Meredith that she slept with another guy, and Meredith told her that she broke up with Finn, asking whether she should tell Derek or not. That night, George came over to her hotel room with DVDs and fried chicken. She didn't let him in, saying that she broke up with him, even though he hadn't noticed that she did.<ref>[[Oh, the Guilt]], x</ref>\n\nAfter that, Callie started to ignore him. He did continue to talk to her though, even though she initially didn't answer. While metaphorically saying that he was ready to commit to her, Callie walked away because he metaphorically called her a pig. However, when Mark proposed to cheer her up again, she declined, and later went to apologize to George for being rude to him. She said not to chase after her anymore, unless he was ready to catch her.<ref>[[Let the Angels Commit]], x</ref>\n\nAt the hospital, Addison and Callie were sitting in a hospital lounge together, when Mark came in, creating an awkward silence. Addison and Callie worked together on a case that day, starting off their friendship. Their patient was a pregnant woman whose baby died in the womb, which really saddened Addison. Callie consoled her, and they became even closer when they both confessed having slept with Mark and regretting it. Addison asked to go and have a drink together, but Callie got paged. Later that evening, Callie had to tell George that his father was in the hospital.<ref>[[Where the Boys Are]], x</ref>\n\nWhile George's brothers were visiting George's father in the hospital, Callie was in there telling them about how she first met George. She stayed in the room to talk with George's brothers, but George asked her to have a little chat. He told her that she shouldn't talk to his family as she broke up with him. While watching a surgery, Bailey, Addison and Callie had a conversation about motherhood. Callie said she wanted a dozen of them and she'd use a nanny to raise them, as she wasn't willing to give up the scalpel. During the conversation, Callie realized she wasn't ready to move on. She went to George's father's room, where George was trying to explain [[Harold O'Malley|Harold's]] medical condition to his brothers. They didn't understand the doctor talk, and Callie came in and explained it to them in car terms.<ref>[[Staring at the Sun]], x</ref>\n\nCallie kept asking George how his father was doing. George didn't understand why she'd care about his father, as they broke up. Callie said that she still cared about him, but George walked away, sarcastically saying that that was the reason why she slept with Mark. Callie then thought that Meredith told George about this and went looking for her to kick her ass. However, Meredith said that Callie only told her that she slept with someone, and that she didn't know it was Sloan until George told him. Callie said that George thought that she cheated on him, but that he didn't know that she slept with Sloan while they were broken up. She then left the intern locker room to go look for George to tell him that. She found him in the staircase. She told him that she slept with Mark while they were broken up and that she'd never betray him, but George said that he didn't have time for this.<ref>[[From a Whisper to a Scream]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Harold O'Malley was telling George to hide his magazines, Callie came to Harold's room to check the healing of his collarbone. George quickly left when she entered the room. Callie stayed in his room and they had a nice conversation. George later entered the room again, and Callie told him she'd go. Harold told his son that he didn't recognize him, as he was constantly picking fights and asked him why he was so mad at Dr. Torres. They both wanted to go, but George's father told them to stay. Callie then listened to Harold's speech on how angry George had become. At the end of the day, Callie once again asked George how his father was doing, and George replied friendly, seeming to have let go of his anger towards Callie.<ref>[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhile his father was in surgery, Callie calmed down George. She wanted him to confess that he was scared, and tried to stare him down like Bailey taught her, and which previously worked on Dr. Shepherd. George said that he was only scared of her because of the staring. After George's dad came out of surgery, Callie went to his room to ask how he was doing. In there, George was staring at his dad's bag with pee. His family members thought he was acting even weirder than usual, but George said to Callie that there was  cc of pee in  hours, which indicated that his kidney function was good, and they both started cheering and dancing together. While dancing, George kissed her and thanked her.<ref>[[Six Days, Part ]], x</ref>\n\nA day later during lunch time, Callie told Addison that George kissed her. Addison wasn't paying attention, and when Callie made a comment on that, Addison told her that she aborted Mark's baby  months ago. She said she told Mark, who marked the due date on the calendar, and the due date was that day. Addison confessed to her that she felt like she ended up alone. While performing a major surgery, Callie noticed that both George and Meredith left after having been paged, and she realized something was wrong with George's dad. She left the OR. She went to a conference room where Bailey was explaining to the O'Malleys that she had to do a complicated procedure on Harold. Callie was looking through the window, but George nodded to make her come in. Bailey told them that they needed to prepare themselves in case the procedure failed. Later that day, Callie looked at Mark, who then realized that Addison told her about the abortion. He asked her if he'd be a terrible father. After some questions about family, Callie said that to some men, family is the most important thing in their life. Mark then asked her if she knew a guy like that, and she said she did, clearly talking about George. At the end of the day, George's father died.<ref>[[Six Days, Part ]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the death of his father, Callie had sex with George constantly, which was getting a little too much for her. When Izzie knocked on his door with muffins, Callie opened the door and left the room. \"This is not grieving, this is my legs being bent in ways my legs do not bend,\" she said. She put Izzie on \"Georgewatch\"  and left Meredith's house. At the hospital, Cristina worked together with Callie. When Callie told her about George's appetite, Cristina said she shouldn't talk to her about it as they weren't friends. Callie said she thought Cristina would be at least a bit concerned. When George walked into her with Izzie, Callie urged Izzie to do something and quickly left. While scrubbing in for a surgery on their patient, Cristina called Callie's work on their patient impressive. They then talked about how they both hadn't talked for a long time with their partners. At the end of the day, George came to Callie's hotel room to have sex again, but Callie told him she couldn't have sex anymore. George then told her how he had been feeling since his father's death. He then told her that watching her made him feel better, so that they didn't have to have sex as watching her from across the room was fine too. He then kneeled in front of her and proposed.<ref>[[Great Expectations]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Callie accepted the proposal, the two got married in Vegas. They went to the clinic, where Richard, Mark, Bailey, Cristina, Alex and Izzie were waiting on the first patients to arrive, to tell them about it. \"We got married in Vegas!\" George yelled. Everyone was surprised, except for Alex. He started laughing and called her Callie O'Malley. A bit later, Izzie asked George if he was really happy, but Callie heard the question and assured her that they were. George told her to show Izzie the ring. When she did, Izzie said that tiny diamonds are great as no one would ever try to steal it. Everyone at the clinic heard this, but Bailey then put everyone to work, and she congratulated the newly weds. The same day, Callie noticed that Addison seemed to be interested in Alex. After Callie asking this, Addison said she didn't as he was an intern. Callie then told Addison that she married an intern. At first, Addison asked her why they got married so fast, but then just congratulated and hugged her. Addison then told her her ring was beautiful, which made Callie happy. Later that day, George asked her what her middle name was. Callie didn't tell him as she thought he let his judgy friends get to him. When George fell ill due to a patient with toxic blood, he admitted that he thought he fell ill because of the anxiety he got from their marriage. This deeply hurt Callie, as he basically told her their marriage was as poisonous as the toxic patient. She later went to check on him and told him her middle name was Iphigenia, saying she couldn't wait to hear what his judgy friends had to say about that. At the end of the day, Callie came to intern's locker room to go home with George together. Izzie then asked her what her plans were. \"You're not moving in, are you?\" she said. Callie wanted to leave, but George made her stay and told to Izzie, Cristina and Meredith that they were his friends and that if they wanted to drive her off, they'd drive him off with her. \"Calliope Iphigenia Torres is my wife,\" he said. Izzie then smiled and opened her mouth, but George told her to not do it.<ref>[[Wishin' and Hopin']], x</ref>\n\nAt the hospital, Callie told Bailey that it was weird being married to someone she was the boss of. She then said that at work, she was giving the orders at work, but in the bedroom, he was. Before she could properly finish that sentence, Bailey told Callie not to tell her about her sex life. At the clinic, Callie overheard Bailey and [[Sydney Heron]] talking about the Chief Resident position. Callie also helped out while Bailey was teaching her interns the process of triage. While doing so, George took a picture of her. She then took him apart to tell him not to undermine her authority, especially not in front of the interns. At the clinic, Callie wanted to help out Sydney, who was told by the Chief to bring every minor patient from the ER to the clinic to treat them there. However, Sydney didn't want her to take over. Callie then told her she'd go to the OR to scrub in on a trauma surgery while Sydney was stuck in the clinic with minor injuries. She went to the ER, where she stood outside with Addison, the Chief and Yang, waiting for the first patient to arrive. She later refused to help George when he asked her to, as she had to go scrub in on a surgery.<ref>[[Walk on Water]], x</ref>\n\nDuring her surgery on a child, George came in to ask her if her patient was the kid he was looking for. When she took a look at the photo he showed, she recognized him as her patient, saying she'd recognize that goofy ears anywhere. Before he left the OR, he said he couldn't kiss her because she had scrubbed in, but he was about to tell what he'd do that night to her. Everyone in the OR started chuckling, so Callie told him to shut up as she was working.<ref>[[Drowning on Dry Land]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Bailey was working on Meredith, she put Callie in charge of her interns. George and Izzie were waiting in the hallway until they got news about Meredith, but Callie told them to come with her to the clinic as they could help out there. Izzie initially didn't come, saying she needed to stay. Callie told her to come once again, which she reluctantly did. At the clinic, Izzie was getting blood ready for Meredith. Callie said Meredith was strong, and Izzie reacted harshly on whatever Callie said. Callie then asked if she was doing something specific to piss her off or if it was just stress related. Izzie said that it was because  Callie was acting like she knew Meredith, though according to her, only she, Cristina and George really knew Meredith. Callie said she did know Meredith as she was George's wife. Izzie said that that didn't mean anything, that it was just a piece of paper. Callie then told her she needed to accept her, as George choose to have her around. She said that if she didn't accept her and let George choose between them, Izzie would lose another friend.<ref>[[Some Kind of Miracle]], x</ref>\n\nWhile having breakfast together in the hotel room, George was whining about how Izzie was so compassionate with her patients and not with her friends, but Callie suggested not to talk about it. At the hospital, George came to Callie to ask her about the room service bill. She said she sometimes payed more for it, and George suggested to split the room service bill like they split the rest, but she told him not to worry about it. He asked how much she payed for the food, and she said  bucks. She then revealed to him that her parents have a lot of money and that they gave her  hundred bucks a week. Callie explained that she didn't tell him about it because the money had affected every relationship she'd had. George then walked away madly because he felt like he payed her  dollars a week for nothing. During a surgery, Izzie made reference to Callie being rich. That night, Callie was mad at George for telling Izzie. He said he only told Meredith and that he was disappointed that she didn't even give him the benefit of the doubt to believe him. She once again blamed him for choosing his friends over her. He then said he hadn't talked to Izzie, whom he called his best friend, in weeks while she had been lying about her background and her family. During the argument, Callie said that Izzie dissed their marriage every chance she got because she had feelings for him and wanted him. This surprised him. \"She's a supermodel, and I'm George,\" he said. This hurt Callie. \"So what does that make me?\" she asked. She then told him to get out of the hotel room.<ref>[[Scars and Souvenirs]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day at work, Callie urged George to pretend like they were a perfect couple because her dad was in town. Izzie then came in, but she left. Seeing her reaction, Callie realized George had told her about their fight. Before she left too, she told George to get in the shower as he smelled. Callie requested another intern besides George, as he still smelled even after showering twice. Bailey picked Izzie, who tried to get away to the clinic with Cristina as she felt awkward because she slept with George the previous night. During lunch with Callie's father at Joe's, Callie assured her father that George wasn't anything like the other guys she had dated. Callie's father noted that George didn't have any money and that thereby the house and the car he'd get his daughter would be on her name. While Callie and her father were arguing about her relationship (her father was disappointed that everything went so fast without he and his wife even knowing she was seeing someone), George remembered the sex he had with Izzie. He then said he wouldn't let them pay for anything and left Joe's bar. Later that day at the hospital, Carlos Torres said he respected that George wanted to care for Callie, but he warned him not to hurt her. Before leaving for the airport, Carlos made Callie agree to let her mother plan a wedding party. Callie then kissed George, saying she was proud because he stood up to her father. She apologized for last night. She then told George to find Izzie and prepare their patient for surgery. That night in their hotel room, Callie told George, who was clearly thinking about Izzie, that she could smell his clothes through the closet doors. He apologized twice, the second time being more for cheating on her with Izzie. However, Callie didn't notice this and continued reading.<ref>[[My Favorite Mistake]], x</ref>\n\nCallie had a rough night being on call, so George suggested to have a coffee date, to which she happily agreed. While looking for George in the clinic to have the coffee date, Meredith told her that he was with Izzie. When he left an elevator, he saw Callie standing there, and he realized he had forgetten their coffee date. He apologized, saying he had been busy in the clinic with patients. Callie knew that he was lying as she had been in the clinic to look for him, but she just went home and decided not to tell him that she knew he was lying.<ref>[[Time After Time]], x</ref>\n\nWhile studying for her intern exam, Cristina wanted to get Callie's study cards really badly. She tried to befriend Callie by asking her to taste the different wedding cake samples, however, Callie was on to her and just said she wasn't getting her cards. Later that day, Callie told Addison about George's lie. At first, Addison agreed with her that it was probably nothing. When Callie said she needed to stop thinking about Izzie, Addison told her that when she's obsessing about something like that, there's generally a reason. Callie also watched George feeding Izzie part of his lunch while laughing together. Callie later told Cristina she'd give her cards to George, but Cristina said he'd only share them with Izzie. Callie then decided to let her have the cards instead of giving them to George and told her where they were. At the end of the day, she asked Izzie to stop being so close to George and give her her husband back.<ref>[[Desire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Burke's and Cristina's mothers came to Seattle to help plan the wedding, Cristina told them she and Callie were friends. They then urged her to ask Callie to be her bridesmaid. Without Callie even agreeing, Cristina's mother started measuring Callie's sizes for a dress. Later that day, Callie told Cristina a couple of things she'd definitely not wear, and Cristina commented to Izzie that this was a right attitude, opposed to Izzie, who was all excited about the wedding. Izzie then found out that Callie was a bridesmaid too, which she obviously didn't like. Later that day, Cristina, Meredith, Izzie and Callie went shopping for dresses. At work, Callie asked if Izzie if it wasn't too weird she was a bridesmaid too, but Izzie said it was fine. Izzie also told her that she thought George's plan to transfer to Mercy West was a good idea. Callie then asked her if they were fine, and Izzie assured her they were.<ref>[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]], x and [[The Other Side of This Life, Part |Part ]], x</ref>\n\nThe day of the intern exam, while asking him medical questions, Callie found out that George got accepted into Mercy West. Callie was excited about this, saying he now could actually tell her about his day as she wouldn't know what happened if they'd work at different hospitals. When Izzie wanted to call George down after Bailey told him how stupid it was to leave the hospital, Callie saw them and she became suspicious again. While Addison was telling Callie about her unfulfilled wish to have a child, Callie confessed she was thinking about having a baby too. In surgery, Callie revealed she used to mountaineer while in high school. In one day, Callie did four osteosynthesis, amputated two hands and she stabilized a spine in two hours, all in three surgeries happening at the same time. When Mark complimented her about this, he said Bailey wasn't the only one having a shot at getting the Chief Resident job. Bailey, who overheard him saying that, was surprised, as she didn't know that Callie was in running for Chief Resident too, and thereby didn't think that she had competition. Callie told her that she was very good at her job. \"We all know you're the Chief's favorite, but that doesn't mean I can't take a shot,\" Callie told her. That night at Meredith's, Cristina was writing her vows, in company of her three bridesmaids. Everyone but Izzie agreed that the vows didn't really matter anymore after the wedding day. Izzie told them that they took love for granted, while she didn't have anyone and couldn't be with the person she loved. She added she could only think about having the man she loved promise her to love, honor and cherish her. Callie and Meredith both realized she was talking about George. \"You're talking about Denny, right?\" Meredith asked, trying to make Callie forget what Izzie said. \"Yeah,\" Izzie answered, obviously lying.<ref>[[Testing --]], x</ref>\n\nThe evening before the wedding, Cristina and her bridesmaids had fun with dresses made out of toilet paper, while Callie helped Cristina writing her vows. The day of the wedding, Callie told George she could only think about having a baby, even though she didn't really want to house a human being inside of her for  months. George left to take care of a patient, but he later told her they could do it if that's what she really wanted. While Izzie was looking for George in the wedding chapel, Callie told her he'd be late as it was a big day for them too. She told her she was named Chief Resident and that they decided to have a baby. This clearly surprised Izzie. Callie later witnessed how Meredith convinced Cristina to walk down the aisle and how Meredith told everyone that the wedding was over. When everybody left, Callie watched how Izzie was sitting on one of the benches.<ref>[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, George asked her to talk later that day, as she didn't come home the previous night because she was swamped with paper work. While she was looking for a disappeared baby, Mark asked her if she was okay. She said she wasn't because she blew the task the Chief gave her, and she suddenly said that she was thinking that George was having an affair. \"If that's true, he's an idiot,\" Mark said. He then advised her to talk to him about it, as an alternative for destroying her career. That night, George came over to talk. Callie knew what he was about to say, and begged him not to say it as she was exhausted. \"Not tonight. I'm your wife. Do this for me,\" she said. George then agreed and walked away.<ref>[[Love/Addiction]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:Chief resident.gif|thumb|xpx|Callie is announced as Chief Resident.]]\nOn her first day as Chief Resident, Callie didn't exactly know what to do when a big trauma was about to come in. She asked the Chief about this, who just said she had to make sure her residents take care of the trauma. He then asked where the residents that she assigned to the ER were. She said she paged them, and told Bailey that she paged them but that they didn't come. \"When I page them, they come running,\" Bailey said, jealous of Callie. The Chief told her to get it together and left. At work, by saying she might be pregnant, Callie tried to cheer up George, who was a bit depressed because he was still an intern while the others passed their intern exams. Alex asked Torres to be let off their case, but she didn't allow that. Behind her back, Alex went to ask Dr. Bailey, but she told him to ask Dr. Torres as she was in charge. Callie overheard him asking and sent him back to the ER. She then said to be Bailey that she had no idea how she got them to listen to her and have respect for her, which made Izzie smile. At some point that day, Callie's patient was being operated on by Alex and Bailey without Callie even knowing about it. When she found out, she went to the OR to ask for an explanation, but Bailey defended Alex by saying that his quick thinking saved the patient. In the evening, Callie was sitting outside when Bailey came over. \"You wanna humiliate me some more? Cause I get it, I suck, I suck at my job, I suck as a wife, I suck all around, so... Go ahead, humiliate me some more, please,\" Callie said. \"Hope tomorrow is better,\" Bailey said, and she walked away.<ref>[[A Change is Gonna Come]], x</ref>\n\nWhen victims of a massive explosion come into the ER, Callie was tested as Chief Resident again. The Chief takes the first patient and tells her to triage the rest. All other residents are taken, so Callie has to work with Izzie, to whom George said that he loved her the previous night. When Bailey asked her to send residents to the clinic to oversee the interns there, Callie told her working at the clinic is voluntary and that she, therefore wouldn't send a resident, but that Bailey was free to take as many interns as she wanted. Her patient, who was asking Mark about his love life, suggested Mark start a relationship with Callie, but she said she was happily married. Callie found out that George was alone with his patient when the patient coded, and George told her that Meredith (his resident) was in the clinic. It turned out that Bailey undermined Callie's authority and sent Meredith to the clinic, even though Callie told her to only take interns. While she was in surgery, Richard came in, blaming her for not delegating well, as one of her residents got attacked and a baby went missing. Izzie told her that she found that Callie was doing a good job as Chief Resident, despite it being difficult. This enervated Callie, who thought Izzie was mocking her, and she sent Izzie out of the OR. That night, the Chief told her he couldn't spend time with his wife because she let a baby disappear from the hospital, making her feel even more miserable.<ref>[[Love/Addiction]], x</ref>\n\nThe day after, Callie was busy with the administrative side of her job in a lounge at the hospital. Bailey kept coming in to inform her what the residents and interns were doing, but Callie wasn't interested. When Bailey asked her if she was going to come out to do her job, Callie asked why she should as Bailey was clearly doing it so much better. She told her she was doing paperwork because she had no more fight in her. Bailey left without any more comments. In the evening, she came back to tell Callie that was struggling with the fact that she was now number two, while she was used to being number one. She then told Callie she'd be the best number two of the hospital and that she'd help Callie, so they'd act like a team. At night, when George came back to the hotel room, she told him just to say it as she clearly knew what he wanted to tell her. He then confessed he slept with Izzie.<ref>[[Let the Truth Sting]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he told her, she kept sitting silently on her bed in the hotel room until it was morning. When he tried to get her to talk, she told him she forgives him, as he made a mistake, but they also took vows. At work, Callie asked Izzie to talk in the cafeteria at noon about what George told her. Izzie thought they were going to fight, a rumor which quickly spread across the hospital. Callie worked together with Bailey that day, who noticed that Callie was thrown off by something. When Callie entered the cafeteria, everyone expected them to fight and while Izzie was getting ready to fight, everyone came to stand around them. \"I wanted to talk,\" Callie says. Izzie was surprised, as she really thought Callie was going to kick her ass. Callie then left without talking, humiliated by Izzie and everyone standing in the cafeteria. Her patient that day had weak bones because her husband urged her to lose weight. When the patient died, Callie went to talk to the patient's husband. She related too much to her personal life and started yelling that he didn't really love his wife, as he pushed her so hard to be skinnier and that you don't destroy the person that you love. George took the man inside, while Bailey asked Callie one more time if she was all right. \"It's nothing,\" Callie said. \"Good. Cause nothing almost cost you your career,\" Bailey says. Izzie later came to apologize for the incident in the cafeteria and for having slept with George. Callie told her she should be humiliated and ashamed and that she shouldn't ask her for forgiveness. George also came to her, saying that she shouldn't forgive him. He told her he knew she said she forgave him because she wanted to pretend it never happened, while she actually didn't forgive him. She said he was right, that she didn't forgive him, and walked away.<ref>[[The Heart of the Matter]], x</ref>\n\nIn the morning of Halloween, Callie and Miranda told the residents what they had to do that day. When Izzie asked a question at Callie, Callie told her to redirect her questions to Bailey. Cristina asked if they all had to redirect their questions to Bailey, but Callie told her it was just for Dr. Stevens. When Bailey asked her why Izzie had to redirect her questions, Callie revealed to everyone that Izzie slept with George. Callie worked together with Mark, and he told her he heard about her marriage. He told her he was available all day and night (in particular) to cheer her up. She confessed that after the wedding in a church and the vows, she couldn't believe her life had become like this. In surgery, when Norman Shales commented that people do strange things, Callie said that she had world's shortest marriage. Cristina told her she was literally left in the church, wearing a wedding dress. They laughed together about their marriage problems. At the end of the day, Callie moved in with Cristina in Burke's apartment, but she was not allowed to clean.<ref>[[Haunt You Every Day]], x</ref>\n\nIn Burke's apartment, Callie slept on the couch. Despite her efforts to assign him to Mark to keep him away from her, Callie ended up working with George when their patients refused to let go off a wedding dress because of a contest. When Callie told Mark she tried to keep him away from her, Mark told her he'd torture George to make her feel better. He did this by having George act as a proxy when both future brides were convinced to let go off the dress, so George had to carry the dress while the women were being treated for their injuries. Callie told Mark it cheered her up indeed. When her patient woke up after surgery and she asked about the wedding dress first, Callie told her that she should fight for a marriage, and not for a wedding, as a marriage could also be a lost cause. She told her patient she needed to learn to let go. After Mark and George's patient came out of surgery, Callie talked to George. He was glad she was talking to him, and she told him she was letting go.<ref>[[Kung Fu Fighting]], x</ref>\n\nRichard tells Callie she needs to be a better Chief Resident, but she has back-to-back surgeries so she asks Bailey to take over for her and act as Chief Resident that day. When Cristina, who had been told by Bailey to try other specialties (Bailey pretended it had been Callie's idea), asked to be on Callie's service, Callie was surprised as she didn't know what Cristina was talking about. However, she quickly got that it had been Bailey's idea and let Cristina scrub in. In surgery, Bailey came in to ask her to solve scheduling problems. Callie told her to solve it herself. The Chief found out about that Bailey was the one acting as Chief Resident, and he fired Callie to give the job to Bailey. Callie went home, where she told Cristina she was fired.<ref>[[Physical Attraction... Chemical Reaction]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day at work, Callie congratulated Bailey with her new job. [[Sydney Heron]] came over to congratulate Bailey as well, while she said she felt sorry for Callie, who assured her she was fine with it. Callie had lunch with Cristina, who kept ranting about Hahn. Callie didn't listen to her, as she kept looking at George and Izzie, who started a relationship. Cristina noticed this and told Callie they weren't worth to get hung up over, as they apparently weren't even talking to each other. Callie commented that that made her feel better. When Callie saw how hard Cristina was trying to impress Hahn, Callie told her she was now only annoying Erica and that she should back off. Callie told her patient that she was fired from Chief Resident, and that it was a good, as she could now get back to the part that she liked: surgery.<ref>[[Forever Young]], x</ref>\n\nCallie had to work together with Izzie. When Hahn asked her if she could steal Izzie from her service, Callie said she could have Izzie for free.<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Mark commented in surgery that Hahn was as mean to herself as she was to others, Callie defended Hahn by making him stop talking. After their surgeries, Hahn asked Callie and Mark if they wanted to have a drink with her. They agreed, although Hahn urged Mark not to hit on her.<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Erica held the elevator for Callie and greeted her by saying \"Dr. Torres\". Callie told Erica that anyone who can outdrink her and then still kick her butt at darts gets to call her Callie. They agreed that last night was fun, and they both commented that they were not a group person because they generally don't like people. As the elevator opened and Mark greeted them, Erica and Callie started laughing. \"Case in point,\" Erica said as she and Callie walked away. Later that day, Callie met [[Louise O'Malley]], whose calls were never returned by George or Callie. Louise, who didn't know that her son and Callie broke up, showed Callie the baby clothes she knitted, as George told her that he and Callie were trying to get pregnant. She took the clothes and went to George to yell at him for not telling his mother that he cheated on her. \"She's waiting in the lobby,\" Callie told George as she handed over the clothes. When Callie met Louise again, she knew because Izzie told her. Louise is concerned that God would punish George for cheating on her. Callie told Louise that she doubted God was present at their Vegas wedding, and she said that even though George wasn't the one for her, she loved being an O'Malley for the little while it lasted. At the end of the day, Callie and Erica went out together.<ref>[[Lay Your Hands on Me]], x</ref>\n\nShe and Erica went out dancing, and it got late, so they went straight to the hospital together. Cristina then discovered that Callie and Erica were friends. Callie also worked together with Izzie in a professional way. Cristina wanted Callie to put in a good word for her with Erica, but Callie says she and Erica don't talk about Cristina. At the end of the day, Callie and Erica hung out at Cristina's apartment.<ref>[[Where the Wild Things Are]], x</ref>\n\nTheir friendship grew closer and they did sunrise yoga together, which they both found to be intense. Callie told Erica about Addison, and Erica agreed with her that Addison was nice. Erica informed Addison that Callie got divorced, and Callie completed Erica's sentence by saying it was the best thing that could've happened. They gave each other a look and started laughing, which Addison noticed. At noon, Callie and Addison met outside to have lunch together. While Callie was walking up to Addison, Cristina approached and told Callie that Erica was no longer welcome in her apartment. Callie came to Erica's defense, naming some of Erica's qualities. Addison overheard what she said, and when Callie sat down, Addison asked her if she and Erica were a couple, because it seemed like they were. Callie tried to laugh it away, and said she was a huge fan of penis. Callie later went to the cafeteria where she asked Cristina and Meredith if people ever thought that they were a couple. \"No, because we screw boys like whores on tequila,\" Meredith said. \"And then we either try to marry them or drown ourselves,\" Cristina added. Cristina then told Callie that she had to make Erica let her scrub in on a surgery, and if not, she would make her move out of her apartment. Callie managed to do this by promising Erica to buy drinks at Joe that night. Addison, Erica and Callie had drinks at Joe's that night, and Addison witnessed how Erica removed a hair that was caught in Callie's lipgloss. Callie felt awkward seeing the way Addison was looking at her, and she went to Mark to dance with him. Erica saw how she left the bar with Mark a little later to have sex with him.<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n\nTrying to forget Addison's comments, Callie constantly wanted to have sex with Mark in the on-call rooms. Later that day, Erica was reading the article of Burke winning the Harper Avery. \"It's because I don't have a penis,\" Erica said, which made Callie feel awkward because she didn't realize just yet that Erica was talking about Burke. Erica asked to go to Joe's again that night, but Callie said she had this other thing. Mark then came over and asked Callie to talk to the nurses to make them stop boycotting him. Erica and Mark started bickering over whether or not he was a good guy, and they asked Callie's opinion, putting her in the middle. She didn't want to choose between them, so she stayed silent. A disappointed Erica walked away, and Callie asked Mark to go to an on-call room with her. In the scrub room, Erica asked if they were on for tonight, but Callie remember her that she had this other thing. Erica was mad that Callie didn't tell her about sleeping with Sloan (which was the other thing) and that she disappeared now that she got a boyfriend, especially because Callie was her new friend and she doesn't make friends easily. In the evening, Callie wanted to go make out with Mark again, but he was not in the mood because all his surgeries got cancelled. At Joe's bar, Callie confessed that she'd been avoiding Erica because Addison implied that they might be lesbians. Erica started laughing, and so did Callie, but they gave each other somewhat of an awkward look.<ref>[[The Becoming]], x</ref>\n\nSome time later, Callie and Mark were having lunch. Callie asked again to have sex, but Mark (still remembering that Bailey called him a whore) told her that he wasn't interested in sex only. Erica joined them, and they started to seduce Mark by acting as if they wanted to do a threesome. Mark tried to resist by saying that the new Mark wasn't interested, but he eventually walked away. When Callie tried to get Mark into an on-call room, he started to talk about Erica Hahn and his fantasies about her. Callie didn't want to hear him talk about Erica in that way and walked away. That evening, Mark entered the elevator where Callie told Erica that Mark had been thinking about a threesome all day. When he finally admitted that he was, Erica said that he wouldn't be able to handle the two of them, but Mark thought that he would if he wanted to. \"You wouldn't find it intimidating?\" Erica asked, and while he said he wouldn't, Erica kissed Callie. Mark was speechless. \"See, too much for you,\" Erica said, and she left the elevator. Callie was completely speechless too, and she followed Mark to an on-call room.<ref>[[Losing My Mind]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Callie's father appears in Seattle to visit his daughter, he is angered by the news that George divorced Callie, initially throwing George against a wall, and then throwing Mark against a wall; and was angered even further by the fact that his daughter is now dating a girl. He attempts to take Callie home with him, but she refuses, and her father cuts her off financially. \n\n\nCallie met Arizona at the Emerald City Bar. While Callie was wiping tears in the bathroom, Arizona came in and told Callie that the hospital talked about her. Arizona said the talk about her was good and when she was over being upset, there'd be people lining up for her. When Callie asked for the names, Arizona leaned in and kissed her. \"I think you'll know,\" Arizona said. They both smiled and Arizona left.<ref>[[Beat Your Heart Out]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:xGeorgeDead-CallieShocked.jpg|thumb|px|Callie is in shock after learning that George is dead]]\nWhile operating on George, [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] stops working and after a moment [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] asks if anyone knows if George was a donor. [[George O'Malley|George]] is declared brain dead and Callie stumbles backwards and starts hyperventilating and Owen tries to calm her. Later in the scrub room, [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] joins Bailey and Callie who look at George and Lexie says the man is too tall to be George. Everyone goes to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] to ask her how she knows and not satisfied with her answer, Callie walks into the John Doe's room to see if he has a freckle George had on his hand (shaped like Texas) that Callie used to tease him about. She checks his hand and starts sobbing silently, confirming it is him. Callie and [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] talk about how it doesn't seem real when [[Louise O'Malley|George's mother]] approaches Callie and tells her that it will be too hard for her to decide what happens to George's organs and because in God's eyes Callie is still George's wife then Callie should decide, Callie accepts. She goes to Arizona in the pit for comfort and Arizona advises her to cry, scream, and eat donuts. Callie then decides that she shouldn't choose alone because George loved someone more than her, even while they were married. Callie tries to convince [[Alex Karev|Alex]] to tell Izzie what happened to George so she can help decide what should happen to his organs and so that she can say goodbye. After Izzie is told, Callie and Izzie go through the forms and decide George would want to give everything.  days later, Callie walks into the chief's office and asks him about her application to become an attending but he says that [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Good Mourning|Dr. Chang]] is still putting off his retirement so it won't happen. Callie complains that Chang is just a figurehead, she is the one who does all the work and is primarily paged and he is just a dinosaur, but the chief yells that he is too. Callie leaves, telling Richard he'll regret it and she deserves to be an attending because she is a superstar. Callie storms into an elevator with Bailey and suddenly breaks down crying.  days later, [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] hammers on Callie's apartment door and she comes out sobbing about losing George, having to get a new job and not seeing her friends again and that Arizona keeps bringing her donuts. Mark comforts her and then gets the idea of moving into the same building as Callie.<ref>[[Good Mourning]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:xMarckComfortsCallie.jpg|thumb|left|xpx|Mark comforts Callie]]\nCallie went into the hall and asked Mark for some wardrobe advice for her first day at Mercy West. After he gave his opinion, she changed in front of him and Lexie, leaving Lexie awkward and shocked. Later at work Callie meets Richard who was admitted after an accident and after confirming there were no big injuries, he just needed sutures, she passed him on to her intern, only on his th day of work. She is later approached by Arizona's old patient and her mother that in which Arizona asked her to perform a scan that she had said Mercy West could perform. When she gets home she gives out to Arizona but tells her she did do the tests although nothing abnormal came up.  days after George's death, Callie walks into Mark's apartment and into the shower she asks him to find out if the chief is going to take up work at Mercy West because that would be bad for her and he tells her he'll try and find out. She goes to leave but Lexie asks her first how gay she really is on a scale  through Gay because she and Mark live next door and Mark is very hot and she just walked on him while he was taking a shower but Callie relaxes her by saying that ever since Mark met Lexie, Callie's breasts were not the first things he looked at when he saw her. After her work day she goes to Joe's bar and relaxes with Arizona.<ref>[[Goodbye]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:xCallieMercyWest.jpg|thumb|px|Callie treats Richard ]]\n\nPrior to the merger, Callie got into an argument with Richard and resigned from Seattle Grace Hospital as he rejected her job application for the attending post. She then started working at Mercy West Medical Center. When the news of the merger of Seattle Grace Hospital and Mercy West Medical Center broke, she considered relocating to other states to work as she figured that Richard would fire her again during the merger. After being encouraged by Arizona, she intended ask Richard for her job back, but decided otherwise when she noticed that Richard was feeling down. In the end, Richard offered her the post of an attending surgeon.\n\n\nHaving children was always one of Callie's dreams. She and George tried before their divorce. When she brought up children to Arizona, she was shocked to learn that Arizona didn't want kids. They broke up over this issue but later reconciled when Arizona said she wanted to have babies with Callie after the hospital shooting.\n\n\nArizona won a prestigious Carter Madison Grant, which would allow her to spend three years in Malawi operating on kids who would otherwise never see a pediatric surgeon. Because Arizona was meant to be gone for three years, Callie planned to go with her. However, while they were at the airport, Arizona realized that Callie didn't really want to go. They fought and ultimately broke up, with Callie staying in Seattle and Arizona going to Malawi and Callie returning to Seattle and having sex with Mark, which resulted in Callie becoming pregnant with Mark's child.\n\n\n[[File:CallieCrashAccident.jpg|thumb|xpx|Callie went through the windshield when their car hit a truck.]]\nMoments after Arizona proposed to Callie, they ran into a truck that was stopped in the road and Callie went through the windshield since she had taken her seatbelt off to retrieve her cell phone, which Arizona had tossed back there. Upon their arrival at the hospital, Callie was presented with massive head and chest injuries, and internal hemorrhaging. She crashed in the ER, but the doctors at the hospital were able to resuscitate her and took her into surgery. She had large epidural and subdural hematomas, and severe internal injuries, which caused intensive hemorrhaging. Her pulse was unstable during the surgery, and the doctors agreed on a temporary abdominal closure, so she could become more stable. The question of whether or not to deliver the baby prematurely at  weeks remained an issue, as cardiovascular stats could be improved by early delivery. After the first surgery, Derek performed neurological tests on Callie to check her neurological functions, but she didn't respond. [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] opted for a percutaneous surgical procedure, as seen during a surgery with [[Preston Burke]], but [[Teddy Altman|Dr. Altman]] rejected her suggestion. After Callie's pressure dropped, she was brought back into surgery, during which [[Owen Hunt|Dr. Hunt]] agreed to Cristina's procedure as Callie remained unstable, and they were out of ideas. Pressure and pulse dropped again, causing Callie to crash. [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] is initially unable to regain her pulse, and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] was forced to deliver the baby early by C-section. The baby had no heartbeat upon delivery, but Arizona was able to get a heartbeat, and so was Dr. Webber, and both Callie and Sofia survived.<ref>[[Song Beneath the Song]], x</ref>\n\nThey named the baby [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]] and she and Callie were discharged from the hospital  weeks later.<ref>[[It's a Long Way Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter a series of unfortunate relationships, Callie got married to Arizona in a beautiful outdoor ceremony where [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] officiated. Callie's mother refused to attend the wedding because she was marrying another woman. Because of this, Callie told her father not to come, so he wouldn't have to choose between his wife and his daughter. At the reception, the newlyweds prepared for the father/daughter dance. Arizona's father danced with her for the dance while Callie tried to hide her disappointment that her father wasn't there for the dance. Mark Sloan offered to dance with Callie since her father wasn't present. Callie's father swooped in during the course of the dance and he cut in to dance with his daughter, saying he'd been waiting for it since he first held her in his arms.\n\n\nThough Callie wasn't on the plane that crashed in the woods, it had a huge impact on her life. Callie's best friend, Mark Sloan, died because of it and her wife, Arizona, had to have her leg amputated due to a severe infection. While waiting for the infection to get better (before the leg was amputated) Callie promised Arizona that she wouldn't cut off the leg. However, during the surgery in which Callie operated on Derek's hand, Alex came in, saying that Arizona was crashing because of her infected leg. Callie then ordered him to cut it off as Arizona would die if the leg wouldn't be amputated.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n[[File:ArizonaAmputatedleg.png|thumb|xpx|Arizona asks Callie how she can \"Snap out of this\" when she cut off Arizona's leg.]]\nFollowing the amputation, Arizona was mad at Callie for a long time. It got so bad that Callie slept at Mark's apartment. Callie stayed with Arizona and helped her whenever she could. Slowly, Arizona allowed Callie back into her life. Yet, Arizona still wasn't comfortable having sex, which is why Callie spent months without having sex. Arizona also refused to let Callie help her when she had problems with her residual limb because she wanted Callie to see her as her wife, not her patient. She ultimately allowed Callie to help by massaging her leg and later that night, they had sex for the first time since the plane crash.<ref>[[Idle Hands]], x</ref>\n\n\nThe doctors involved in the plane crash used the lawsuit money to buy the hospital at Callie's suggestion. They now serve as the hospital board.\n\n\nWhile attending [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] baby shower, Arizona asked Callie to have another baby and decided she'd like to carry this one. They chose a donor and soon, Arizona was pregnant. However, on the day of their first ultrasound, Callie was unable to come to the appointment because she was operating on [[Travis Reed]] and the surgery ran long. After she finished the surgery, Arizona came into the scrub room and told her that the OB did the ultrasound and couldn't find a heartbeat.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\n\nDuring the superstorm, Arizona escorted [[Lauren Boswell]] to an on-call room after Lauren asked where she could sleep. Arizona was just leaving when Lauren spoke up and asked her to stay there. Arizona shook her head but Lauren was adamant. In the end, Arizona agreed to keep her company, but when Lauren got too close, Arizona realized what was happening and tried once more to leave. This led to Lauren mentioning that it was okay to let loose once in a while. After thinking about this, Arizona locked the door to the on-call room and the two had sex. Callie found out about this when she came to look for Arizona and saw her wedding ring pinned to the scrub top Lauren was wearing. This happened because the two had accidentally switched shirts after sleeping together.\n\n\nAfter having to cut off a famous Olympic athlete's legs due to infection, she was sued for malpractice. Callie had never performed the procedure and had to leave a sponge in the patient due to complications. In the end, she won the lawsuit and everything was okay. Later that night, with the encouragement of her father, Callie went to Arizona's hotel room and asked her to come home. Callie did not know that at the time Dr. Murphy was having sex with Arizona.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:CallieDance.jpg|px|thumb|Callie's second underwear dance]]\nCallie always wanted many children. At Meredith's baby shower, the couple had an idea of trying for a second child. Arizona got pregnant with their second child but shortly afterward had a miscarriage.\n\n\nCallie met Penny online and they started dating. They had been dating for a few months when Callie introduced her to her friends, which led to the revelation that Penny had played a part in Derek's death. This put a serious strain on their relationship, especially with Penny's recent re-match to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Callie attempted to ignore her love for Penny, but was unable to do so. As her friends' hateful feelings towards Penny faded over time, Callie and Penny made up.\n\n\nPenny won the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]] and Callie decided to move to New York after Penny asked her to, taking Sofia along. She informed Arizona about her decision. Upset that Callie did not discuss this issue of uprooting Sofia from Seattle, Arizona decided to file a lawsuit against Callie for custody of Sofia. When trying to get her friends to testify for her in the custody hearing, Callie mentioned to Penny that she thought Meredith would be on Arizona's side because they were in a plane crash together, but by the end of the day she managed to get Owen and Meredith to testify for her.<ref>[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]], x</ref>\n\nBefore the custody hearing started, Arizona and Callie's respective lawyers tried to negotiate to prevent going to court but failed to come to a compromise. In court, after hearing both sides, Callie eventually lost the lawsuit as Arizona was granted the sole physical custody of Sofia.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref> Despite this ruling, Arizona, seeing how sad Callie was, agreed to let Callie have her for alternating school years and Christmases.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\n\nCallie is portrayed as a friendly and easy-going person who is able to work with everyone. Even the usually icy [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] eventually warmed up to her and asked her to be her maid of honor. She is well-regarded by her fellow attendings, both professionally and personally.\n\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nArizona initially brushed Callie off after kissing her in the bathroom at [[Emerald City Bar]]<ref>[[Beat Your Heart Out]], x</ref>, considering her to be a \"newborn\" as far as lesbian relationships go, but when Callie confronted Arizona at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's]], she embarrassed herself and Arizona in front of Arizona's date, Julie.<ref>[[An Honest Mistake]], x</ref>\n[[File:Callie&Arizona.jpg|thumb|xpx|Callie and Arizona kiss for the first time.]]\nArizona later found Callie and admitted she misjudged and asked her to dinner; Callie initially played hard to get, saying she would check her schedule, but gave in quickly, sticking out her arm to stop the elevator and accepting the date.<ref>[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]], x</ref> They then entered a relationship. When George O'Malley died, Arizona kept bringing Callie donuts - because that's what helped her when her brother died - which made her more upset.\n\nAfter that, Callie started to work for Mercy West then comes back when both hospitals were merged. During that time, she and Arizona hit a rough patch, when she found out Arizona did not want kids. They soon broke up. They got back together after the shooting at the hospital when Arizona said she wanted kids, but only with Callie.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref> Not long after that, Arizona and Callie moved in together but broke up again when Arizona won a grant to set up a clinic in Africa to help kids and left Callie at the airport after figuring out she didn't really want to go.<ref>[[That's Me Trying]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:x-.png|thumb|left|Wedding day!]]After a brief stay in Malawi, Arizona came back because she missed Callie, but Callie slammed the door in her face.<ref>[[Adrift and at Peace]], x</ref> Arizona spent some time trying to get Callie back unsuccessfully, but when she cornered Callie in an elevator, she found out that Callie was pregnant with Mark's baby.<ref>[[Start Me Up]], x</ref> Callie and Arizona got back together and agreed to raise the baby together.<ref>[[Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)]], x</ref>\n\nAfter their baby shower, while she and Arizona were on their way to a weekend away, Mark texted Callie when he found out Lexie was in a relationship with Jackson and Arizona threw the phone in the backseat. They started to argue about Mark being involved in their lives and Callie took her seatbelt off to get her phone. While arguing, Callie told Arizona she was trying to do everything to make her, Mark, and the baby happy and would do anything for Arizona to make her happy. Arizona took a moment to think and then looked at Callie and said, \"Marry me.\" Before Callie could answer, she gasped and Arizona turned to see Callie was gasping at a truck in front of them that Arizona had not seen because she had taken her eyes off the road.<ref>[[This is How We Do It]], x</ref> They rear-ended the truck and while Arizona had minor injuries, Callie was ejected from the vehicle and nearly died. After two surgeries, including the premature delivery of [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|their daughter]], Callie woke up and told Arizona she'd marry her.<ref>[[Song Beneath the Song]], x</ref>\n\nLater, they married in a ceremony officiated by [[Miranda Bailey]]. Callie's parents left before the wedding because of her mother, who didn't approve of her getting married to a woman and having a baby out of wedlock. Mark ended up walking Callie down the aisle. Later, during the reception, there was a father-daughter dance which Arizona said she forgot to remove from the schedule, but Callie said she would sit it out. Mark then danced with her, only to have Callie's father cut in to tell her he's been looking forward to this day ever since he held her in his arms when she was a baby.<ref>[[White Wedding]], x</ref>\n\nArizona cheated on Callie with [[Lauren Boswell]] during the superstorm<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref> and their marriage was strained. However, after Callie's malpractice suit, she asked Arizona to move back home.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref> After April and Matthew's failed wedding, they bought a [[Callie and Arizona's House|house]] together.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref> They also recently decided to expand their family by having another child. However, the couple struggled to get past previous issues. They tried couples therapy and separation, but Callie discovered that she was happier without Arizona so they got divorced.<ref>[[Bend & Break]], x</ref>\n\nEventually, Arizona realized that Sofia needed both her parents and she decided to move back to New York with Sofia. Since Callie had split from Penny, the move rekindled the romance between Callie and Arizona.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMark and Callie were best friends, and Callie once referenced Mark as her \"work-husband\" and herself as his \"work-wife\" while they were both dating other people separately. While she and George were broken up, she met Mark at [[Emerald City Bar]] and invited him back to her hotel room. They started sleeping together again after she and George split up permanently. He helped her figure out that she liked [[Erica Hahn]]. Mark and Callie had a relationship which started with sex. When Callie starting seeing Erica, they stopped sleeping together and became friends and remained close friends. After Mark broke up with Lexie, Callie was the one who told Mark to get back together with her.\n[[File:Oncallroom.jpg|thumb|xpx|Mark and Callie after an encounter.]]\nWhen Arizona won the Carter Madison Grant and Callie prepared to move to Malawi with her, Mark told Callie that she shouldn't go to Africa if she doesn't want to. After Arizona realized she didn't want to go, she left Callie in an airport. After the break-up, Callie went to Cristina Yang's party, heartbroken about Arizona. She ended up moving in with Mark temporarily, just until she could get rid of the sub-letter at her place. After a night of drinking to celebrate Derek getting a grant for his Alzheimer's research, Callie approached Mark for a palate-cleansing \"sorbet.\" They started a short fling, which resulted in the conception of their daughter, [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]].\n\nAfter Arizona returned from Malawi, she decided she was in and the three raised Sofia together until Mark's death.\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nCallie first met [[George O'Malley]] when he dislocated his shoulder after falling down a flight of stairs. She recognized him as the intern who single-handedly performed open-heart surgery in a stalled elevator, saving the patient's life. Clearly interested in getting to know him better, she gave him her number. However, George could not summon the courage to call her, so she started to ignore him.\n\n[[File:O'Callie.jpg|thumb|right|px|The newly-weds.]]\n\nGeorge eventually called her and asked her out, and began dating her shortly after. While looking for Callie one night, George stumbled onto her \"home\" in the hospital basement. She quickly explained that it was simply easier to stay at the hospital since she was always there, and defended that she wasn't crazy. He kissed her and the two proceeded to have sex.\n\nShortly before the hospital prom, Callie said \"I love you\" to George and later revealed that it was the first time she said that to a man. She was upset that George did not reciprocate her gesture, but he replied saying that he will only say it when he means it. The couple promptly made up after that although Izzie's strong dislike for Callie sometimes made it difficult.\n\nThe Chief later found out about Callie's living arrangements in the hospital and kicked her out because it was against protocol. She temporarily moved in with George at Meredith's, but he was uncomfortable with how quickly their relationship was progressing, so she left and moved into the [[Archfield Hotel]]. Callie made an effort toward reconciliation by inviting George to her hotel room one evening, but he stood her up to support Izzie in her time of need. Upset at how George was always placing Izzie and Meredith before her, Callie ended her relationship with George.\n\nThe same night, Callie went to Joe's, where she met Dr. Mark Sloan and invited him back to her room. After a brief fling, she refused Mark's continued advances but also discouraged George from chasing after her out of guilt, even though she was still in love with him. However, [[Alex Karev|Dr. Alex Karev]] overheard Callie talking about her fling with Mark, and informed George about it. George was furious that Callie had slept with another man, but was distracted when his father was admitted for heart and [[cancer]] surgery. He decided to shelve his relationship problems and placed his relationship with Callie on hold.\n\nCallie provided emotional support in spite of her strained relationship with George, bonding with his brothers and communicating the seriousness of their father's illness to his brothers. George rejected her help initially, stating that they had already broken up, but with encouragement from his father, George gradually began allowing Callie back into his life and family circle. When it seemed that Mr. O'Malley's condition was taking a turn for the better, George kissed a confused and stunned Callie. After George's father died, Callie provided physical support as George dealt with his grief through sex, but she was still shocked by George's sudden proposal.\n\nCallie accepted George's proposal, and the couple got married in [[Las Vegas]], leading Alex and Dr. Sydney Heron to dub her \ucCallie O\uMalley\ud. Although Addison was genuinely happy for Callie, Izzie was less than supportive of Callie's marriage. Callie eventually tired of Izzie's antagonism and threw down the gauntlet saying that if it came down to taking sides, George would definitely side with her. For a while, it seemed like that might be the case - George moved out of Meredith's house and stayed with Callie in her hotel room, paying what he believed to be his share of the expenses - $ a week. When Izzie insinuated to George that he made a mistake in getting married, he continued to avoid her at the hospital.\n\nHowever, Callie eventually confessed to George that their hotel bill was much more expensive than she'd led him to believe, and she did not receive a discount through family friends, as she had told him. She confessed that her parents \"had money\", making her well-off as well, leading George to accuse her of concealing her wealth from him while using his money to tip housekeeping. Word of Callie's wealth spread among the other interns, and Izzie commented on it during surgery with Callie. Angry that George had told Izzie her secret, Callie confronted him that evening with her suspicions about Izzie's true feelings for George, ultimately throwing him out of their room for the night. Confused, George confided to Izzie about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two.\n\nCallie reconciled with George at work the next day and survived a surprise visit from Callie's father - during which George impressed Callie by refusing to allow her father to help them financially - and George was allowed back into the hotel room. However, Callie was still unaware of his drunken one-night stand with Izzie the night before.\n\nCallie became increasingly suspicious of George and Izzie after witnessing the two of them hanging out together on several occasions. Not knowing what else to do, Callie confronted Izzie in an elevator, begging her to return George to her. Subsequently, Callie decided to have a baby with George, a request to which he agrees.\n\nCallie was informed later about George and Izzie's affair leading to George ending the marriage. Callie was angry at first and wanted to talk to Izzie about it and asked her to meet her in the hospital cafeteria, but Izzie thought that Callie actually wanted to beat her up. That day before the lunch break, everyone knew about the \"fight\" that was going to happen. By acting as if the fight was really going to happen in front of everyone in the cafeteria, Callie was severely humiliated by Izzie.\n\nLater on, Callie confessed to Arizona that she wished for Izzie to die when George left her to start a relationship with Izzie, but she deeply regretted this when Izzie was diagnosed with cancer. When she found out that George enlisted in the army, she wanted to stop him and planned an intervention with Bailey and George's friends, not knowing that George was the John Doe trauma patient they just got. When he died, Callie broke down.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Erica Hahn and Callie kiss.]]After Callie and George got a divorce, she started a friends with benefits relationship with Mark Sloan. During this relationship, Callie also started becoming close with Erica Hahn. Mark began to tease the two about how close they were, talking about them kissing and asking Callie if she ever thought about grabbing Erica's hair in surgery and kissing her. This was the start of Callie discovering her sexuality. When Addison Montgomery came back to Seattle Grace for a special case, she asked Callie if she was 'speaking the vagina monologues now', after seeing how close Callie and Hahn were.<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref> Callie began using Mark for sex more, to convince herself she wasn't attracted to Hahn, but he eventually let her go and told her to go after Erica.\n\nCallie finally got the courage up and kissed Hahn,<ref>[[Freedom, Part ]], x</ref> and the day afterward, they ignored each other.<ref>[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]], x</ref> After talking about it with Hahn, they decided to take their relationship slow and explore together at a pace they were comfortable with.<ref>[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]], x</ref> The first time they had sex, Callie didn't enjoy it. She voiced her concerns to Mark, who didn't want to hear about it. Later, Callie and Hahn spoke and Hahn said she had a great night, which confused Callie. She then went back to Mark, and asked him to \"teach her\" his technique, because she wanted to be \"good at this\". After this, Callie and Hahn tried again, and she and Hahn started going out.<ref>[[There's No 'I' in Team]], x</ref> One morning, Erica looked at Callie and compared her realization that she was a lesbian to when she got glasses and could see everything clearly again. Her emotional confession scared Callie a lot.<ref>[[Life During Wartime]], x</ref> After Hahn discovered that Izzie Stevens had stolen a heart for Denny Duquette, which resulted in one of her patients missing out on a heart, she told Callie that she was going to report the hospital for not reporting the situation to UNOS. Callie asked her what good it would do, starting a fight between them with Erica complaining that Callie couldn't \"kind of be a lesbian\".<ref>[[Rise Up]], x</ref> After their fight, Erica quit her job as Head of Cardio at Seattle Grace and left Seattle.<ref>[[These Ties That Bind]], x</ref> She hasn't returned since.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAlex and Callie slept together after a big surgery involving reconstruction of a man's legs was successful when Callie was a th-year resident. No one knew at the time, but the relations were later revealed when Callie gave her speech at Lecture Day.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n\n[[Penelope Blake|Penny Blake]]\n[[File:CallierevealsPenny.png|thumb|xpx]]\nCallie was dating Penny Blake. She's the doctor who didn't get a CT for Derek, a decision that ultimately led to his death. Penny never told Callie this as she wasn't aware that Derek and Callie were close. The relationship had Callie feeling really good, right up until the point that Meredith revealed who Penny was. Callie was caught in the middle, as she wanted to be there for Meredith, but also couldn't turn off her feelings for Penny.\n\nWhen Penny started to work at Grey Sloan Memorial and Meredith didn't treat her as she'd treat other residents, Callie tried to help out by talking to Meredith and other attendings, but they just dismissed her as too protective of her girlfriend. Penny also made it very clear that she didn't need Callie to stand up for her as she could that herself.\n\nAfter Penny received a prestigious offer to work in New York for a year,<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref> Callie decided to go with her.<ref>[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]], x</ref> After a big and nasty custody battle with Arizona, who didn't want Sofia to move to New York with them, Arizona gained full custody of Sofia.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref> This prompted Callie to end her relationship with Penny, as she couldn't leave her daughter behind.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> Later, Arizona decided to adjust the custody arrangement and allow Callie to take Sofia to New York, so she could go with Penny and be happy.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref> Some time after the move, Callie and Penny broke up.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nThey became close when Callie moved in with her after Burke left Yang and George left Callie. Together, they purchased an apartment and lived there until Owen and Cristina moved out. They remained fairly close throughout the years as Yang is the godmother to Sofia. The friendship faded over the years as both became more invested in their relationships.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nOwen and Callie became closer after the plane crash, which caused both of their wives to change significantly. After leaving their spouses, they bonded over their shared experience of trying to find new love.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith and Callie has some significant bonding over time after the death of George. They became much closer after Arizona cheated on Callie, as Callie temporarily lived in Meredith's house.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]\nCallie and Addison were good friends while they worked together in Seattle. In fact, Callie was one of the few people to find out that Addison had had an abortion. Addison came back from L.A. when Callie was in a car accident to take care of her and the baby and ended up delivering Sofia.\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nBailey and Callie became good friends when they worked together in Seattle. In fact, Miranda and Callie had such a tight bond that they enjoyed girls nights, and talked about relationships together. Miranda was the second person Callie went to when she began to see [[Erica Hahn]]. Callie was a bridesmaid at Bailey's wedding.\n\n\nCallie was first introduced as the [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic resident]] who fixed George's dislocated shoulder in the ER.\n\nAt the end of Callie's fourth year of residency, she was named the new [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]] but was later demoted and the position of chief resident was given to [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]], who had tried to cover up for her until the ploy was discovered by Chief Webber.\n\nNearing the end of her residency, Callie put in a request for an attending position at Seattle Grace Hospital, but since her superior was putting off retirement, the Chief couldn't agree to her request. Callie, who basically ran the ortho department as the best ortho surgeon on staff, then quit and took an attending position at [[Mercy West Medical Center]], but not long after, she returned to Seattle Grace Hospital, as both hospitals were set to merge to become [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], where Callie continued to work as an attending. At some point, after years of being an attending, Callie was promoted to head the orthopedic surgery department.\n\nAfter the plane crash, Callie and  other doctors invested the money from the lawsuit and bought the hospital with financial help from the Harper Avery Foundation, creating [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where Callie is a board member.\n\nHighlights of Callie's career include making [[Sunder Atluri|a man]] with severely misshapen legs walk again, being the first surgeon ever to build cartilage from scratch, saving Derek's hand after the plane crash and building robotic prosthetic limbs to make amputees walk again. Callie has given a speech at the TED conference about her accomplishments.\n\nCallie's current work situation is unknown, but she mentioned to Bailey that she had received offers from NYU and Columbia, amongst others. Wherever she ended up is a step down from her position as [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Orthopedic Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] as all the offers were just for an Attending position.\n\n\n*Callie had a pet ferret for nine years.<ref>[[Scars and Souvenirs]], x</ref>\n*Callie speaks Spanish fluently.<ref>[[Sweet Surrender]], x</ref>\n*She dislikes sandwiches and salad, but she likes pizza.<ref>[[What a Difference a Day Makes]], x</ref>\n*She is Catholic.\n*During her brief marriage to [[George O'Malley]], she was referred to as \"Callie O'Malley\". Even after the divorce and George's death, [[Louise O'Malley]] still considered her to be part of the family.\n*She did sunrise yoga with [[Erica Hahn|Erica]].<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n*Callie's apartment number in Seattle was .<ref>[[Good Mourning]], x</ref>\n*Callie suffers from glossophobia, the fear of speaking in public.<ref>[[The Time Warp]], x</ref>\n*Callie doesn't seem to have a problem with people seeing her in her underwear, evidenced by the time she didn't put on pants while talking to Richard after he caught her dancing in her underwear, when she peed in front of Izzie and Meredith, and later when she changed into her scrubs in a crowded ER.\n*Callie danced in her underwear twice on the show. The first time in \"[[I Am a Tree]]\" when Richard caught her in the basement, and the second time at the end of \"[[I Bet It Stung]]\" when she returned home to her apartment. During both times, Callie wore the same white underwear.\n*Her [[United States Medical Licensing Exam#Step |intern exam]] flash cards are legendary; her fifth-year study method for the [[Board Certification|board certification]] holds the same reputation.\n*Although not stated directly in dialogue, Callie is [[Board Certification|board certified]] in [[Board Certification#American Board of Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic surgery]] as she developed a study method, and later taught to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]].\n*Callie's dream (other than ortho) was to be a mom. This dream is fulfilled now that she has [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]].\n*Everyone calls her Callie, except for her father, [[Carlos Torres|Carlos]], her ex-wife, [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], and her ex-girlfriend, [[Penelope Blake|Penny]], who call her Calliope.\n*Her blood type is A+.<ref>[[Song Beneath the Song]], x</ref>\n*While her first appearance is [[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]], it is shown in [[The Time Warp]] that she was at the hospital earlier than that as she began her residency at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n*She likes to dance.\n*Both Callie and [[Aria Torres|her sister]] have musical names. The name Calliope means \"beautiful voice\" in Greek and Aria means \"melody\" in Italian.\n*Callie didn't like any of the cute baby names Arizona chose, so Arizona buried the cute names in a bunch of terrible names. Unfortunately, her plan backfired when Callie said she loved Agamemnon.\n**Callie's middle name, Iphigenia, was the daughter of Agamemnon in Greek myth. Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter to the gods in hope for his ships to sail.\n*She has the bad habit of just checking whose calls she missed instead of actually listening to the voicemail that the caller left her.<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n*She used to live in the hospital basement.\n*In [[Walking Tall]], dialogue confirms that Callie is the department head of orthopedic surgery.\n**Callie's appointment to head of ortho happened off-screen.

He told Amelia about his concern and Amelia went to talk to Cassidy herself in the hopes of figuring out what happened. Amelia explained that Cassidy needed surgery, but surgery would put the fetus at risk, so she needed to know if Cassidy wanted to continue the pregnancy. Cassidy said she couldn't afford another child. She was already struggling with just Henry. Owen asked her if she tried to abort by throwing herself down the stairs. She said she hadn't. She'd never do anything that could take her away from Henry. She had tried to go to a clinic with financial assistance, but something always came up and she couldn't go. So she used an herb she found on the internet and doubled it to make sure it would work. But the herb made her dizzy, which is how she fell down the stairs. Amelia said if she didn't want to continue the pregnancy, Owen could have someone from OB come during her surgery and do the abortion after the bleeding was controlled. However, Owen immediately contradicted that and said he'd rather deal with the bleeding and then deal with the pregnancy after she was done. Cassidy had her surgery and afterward, Amelia got a nurse from OB to come give her the first pill to induce abortion.

After the big explosion in the hospital, she was fired by Chief Bailey. While at Grey Sloan, she developed a brief romantic liaison with [[Arizona Robbins]].\n\n\n\nWhen she was two, her father looked for swimming lessons for her. Instead of getting them, her mother threw her into the pool.\n\n\nAfter deciding the residency program needed work, Catherine Avery convinced Miranda Bailey to hire Eliza to come in and shake things up. She first held a meeting with all the residents and asked them about the attendings and what they liked and didn't like about the program. Then she observed several surgeries, giving tips to the attendings on how they could improve their residents' experience and teach them more. At the end of the day, she told Bailey she was fielding a few other offers, but she liked the idea of working there. ''(\"[[Why Try to Change Me Now]]\")''\n\n\nWhile unpacking, she saw on the news that a building had collapsed and rushed to the hospital to help out. ''(\"[[You Haven't Done Nothin']]\")''\n\nOn her official first day, Eliza re-arranged the surgical schedule so she could be involved in as many surgeries as possible. However, the attendings conspired to work against her and shut her out of their surgeries. She in particular butted heads with Richard, who believed she was overstepping and invited her to fight. ''(\"[[Jukebox Hero]]\")''\n\nEliza butted heads with Meredith when Meredith refused to allow Minnick to employ her teaching strategy in one of Meredith's surgeries. As a result, Bailey suspended Meredith. When Eliza heard about this, she went to Bailey and instructed her not to suspend anyone else, as it was contrary to her method of getting people on board with her program. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she decided it was time to implement the second phase of her teaching program, Eliza drew two resident's names (Ben and Stephanie's) out of a hat to do start-to-finish surgeries. She followed Stephanie along on her case. Her first intended patient died before surgery, so she and Eliza went down to the ER to troll for cases. They found [[Matty]], a  year old with gallstones. Arizona found out and insisted on scrubbing in because Matty was a child. During surgery, Matty died. Eliza was stunned and walked away even after Stephanie asked what had happened. Arizona followed her and told her she screwed up by not talking to Stephanie, who had just lost her first child and was vulnerable to quitting the program. However, Eliza revealed that it was the first child she'd ever lost. Arizona coached her on how to get through it and then they went to tell Matty's parents. However, they found Richard already helping Stephanie tell them. Eliza cried in her car after work. When Arizona found her, she hugged her and told her she could have friends at the hospital if she wanted. ''(\"[[It Only Gets Much Worse]]\")''\n\nEliza coordinated the residents working on a kidney transplant from [[Cynthia Daniels]] to [[Christopher Daniels]]. When Cynthia's remaining kidney died, Eliza was part of the discussion about the legality of whose kidney it was. In the end, Cynthia's kidney was put back in her body and Christopher received a kidney from his father. ''(\"[[Back Where You Belong]]\")''\n\n\nEliza sat down with Richard and Bailey and evaluated each of the residents. She had concerns about Ben, noticing that he'd started taking safer cases after the death of [[Gretchen McKay]] and her baby. She also worried about Stephanie, because she hadn't had counseling after the death of [[Kyle Diaz]]. When Stephanie threw a tablet at [[David Fisher|David Fisher's]] head, Eliza recommended suspension. Stephanie had a meeting with the three of them, where she was told her surgical privileges were revoked and she would have to undergo counseling. ''(\"[[Leave It Inside]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Liam Fisher]] came into the ER with a persistent headache, he was diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma. They were going to operate, but they had to find his parents first. When they found them, they declined consent on religious grounds. He went home with his parents, but later returned again. Eliza learned he was having surgery and asked Alex how he got the parents to consent. Alex said he didn't need it because the case had become emergent. Eliza was suspicious, so she questioned Stephanie about the case, but Stephanie stood by the chart. After Stephanie threw a tablet at Liam's father's head, Eliza said Stephanie needed to be suspended until she completed counseling. ''(\"[[Leave It Inside]]\")''\n\nWhen Stephanie returned before completing all the therapy, Eliza was upset to learn that Richard had signed the form to allow her early return. She assigned Stephanie to babysitting duty, having her watch [[Keith]] for signs of internal bleeding. ''(\"[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]]\")''\n\n\nIn the midst of the chaos caused by an explosion and the subsequent hospital fire, Jackson asked Eliza to inform the police that Stephanie was missing. However, since Eliza was preoccupied with the protocol to get the patients out of the building, she completely forgot to do so. Later, in a meeting with Catherine, Richard, and Bailey, she defended herself, stating that if Edwards had listened to her and gone to counseling, she wouldn't have been in any danger. Bailey countered that [[Erin Miller]] wouldn't have made it out alive then, and promptly fired Eliza, explaining that they don't need surgical robots who strictly follow protocols. They need doctors who know when to ditch protocol and save patients, and Richard knows how to train those. Eliza then went to pack up her stuff and told Arizona she had been fired. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\nAfter being fired, she refused to respond to Arizona and moved out of her apartment without so much as a goodbye. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nWhen she first came to Grey Sloan, she flirted with Arizona Robbins, telling her she didn't need to write her name down to remember it. ''(\"[[Why Try to Change Me Now]]\")''\n\nWhen she came to the hospital to help out after a building collapsed, she was surprised that Arizona appeared not to remember their conversation, but Arizona admitted that she did and she was interested, but she didn't like that Eliza talked like she owned the place. They agreed to go get a drink together. ''(\"[[You Haven't Done Nothin']]\")''\n\nThe next day, when Eliza officially started, Arizona had joined the resistance against Eliza's policies. Despite this, Eliza found Arizona at the end of the day and told her that her allowing Leah to take the lead on the Wallace baby was a perfect example of her teaching strategy and thanked her for being on board. ''(\"[[Jukebox Hero]]\")''\n\nAs Arizona was leaving the hospital the next day, Eliza found her and when Arizona claimed she'd be happy if Eliza were fired, Eliza called her on it, saying it would scare her because it would mean the two of them could be something. ''(\"[[None of Your Business]]\")''\n\nAfter losing her first child patient, Eliza was distraught and Arizona coached her on how to get through that loss. At the end of the day, when Arizona was leaving work, she saw Eliza crying in her car and hitting the steering wheel. This caused the horn to honk continuously. Arizona told her to pop the hood and she quickly pulled the horn wire, which she told Eliza she'd need to have fixed. Eliza thanked her and then they hugged. Arizona told Eliza that she could have friends at the hospital if she wanted. ''(\"[[It Only Gets Much Worse]]\")''\n\nAround the hospital, the two continued to pretend not to get along. However, at the end of the night, Arizona said she didn't want to pretend, because Eliza's nice and funny and people should know that. Eliza told her to be quiet and kissed her. ''(\"[[Back Where You Belong]]\")''\n\nEliza asked Arizona about how big her stove was, because she wanted to make Arizona pierogi. She then flirtatiously said, in Polish, that once Arizona had her pierogi, she'd never want anyone else's. However, that evening, when Eliza went to find Arizona, she was asleep on the couch. They agreed to rest for a minute and then rally, but they both fell asleep and when they woke up, it was morning. They leaned in for a kiss, but Richard Webber interrupted, discovering their relationship. ''(\"[[Civil War]]\")''\n\nAfter they'd been seeing each other for a while, Eliza told Arizona she was ready for them to have sex. They made plans for that night, but they were cancelled when one of Arizona's patients went into labor, but Arizona told Eliza that she looked for her around the hospital all the time and that the anticipation of waiting one more day wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. The next night, they left the hospital and went to Arizona's house, where they had sex. ''(\"[[Leave It Inside]]\")''\n\nAfter the hospital fire chaos had settled, Arizona found Eliza and suggested they go back to her place to have overly tired sex before getting some sleep. Eliza told her she couldn't. She needed to pack up her things because she'd been fired. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\nEliza \"ghosted\" Arizona, not replying to her messages and moving out of her apartment without saying a word to Arizona about it. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she started observing surgeries and giving tips at Grey Sloan Memorial, she immediately started to ruffle feathers with the other doctors, leading them to form an alliance against her.\n\n\nMinnick is a [[Board Certification|double-board certified]] [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic surgeon]], with a specialty in [[Orthopedic Surgery#Sub-Specialties|sports medicine]], and educational consultant.

Then the babies were flipped so the surgery could continue and it went well.\n\nWhile they were separating their spines, they struggled to decide how to proceed without paralyzing Brandi. They made a decision and after the separation was complete, they stimulated each girl to test nerve function. Andi responded immediately, but Brandi needed much more stimulation for her feet to move.\n\nBrandi was then moved to a separate gurney and taken to a separate OR while Andi stayed in the original OR for her surgery to be finished.\n\n\nWhile Andi's surgery proceeded as expected, the one kidney left in Brandi's body failed, putting pressure on the rest of her body. They continued to operate and Alex had the idea to bring Andi, whose surgery had been finished by then, back into the OR to retrieve one of the two kidneys in her body to transplant into Brandi. As they are identical twins, there would be no need for anti-rejection meds as her body would recognize the kidney as her own. The transplant went well and both Andi and Brandi were stable in the PICU after surgery.

''(\"[[This is Why We Fight]]\")''\n\nWhen the hospital bought a LODOX to do full-body scans with smaller amounts of radiation, Heather offered to test it out to find a marble she stuck up her nose as a child. Eventually, they did use it and found the location of the marble. ''(\"[[Idle Hands]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek was told he needed to teach interns other than [[Shane Ross]], Heather was assigned to his service. Derek was initially annoyed by her need to chatter in the OR, which she did because she was nervous, but he was impressed by her reflexes. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\nHe continued to mentor Heather, though she was initially reluctant. She was upset to be removed from the case of [[Kayla Wayne]], who had been sawed in half, in order to work on a patient with Moyamoya disease. ''(\"[[Do You Believe in Magic]]\")''\n\nDerek figured out that Heather chattered throughout their surgeries to coverup the fact that she lacked confidence in her natural talent and he took it upon himself to build up her confidence. Later, while they were placing a stent in [[Paul Dawson]], Derek was informed that Meredith had fallen down the stairs and was going to OB to get checked out. Heather assured him that the hard part was over and she could finish without him. ''(\"[[Readiness is All]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the superstorm, Dr. Shepherd told Shane to find Brooks. When he bumped into Brooks, he told her to go and search for Dr. Webber, which Dr. Bailey told him to do. Brooks went into the generator room, searching for Dr. Webber and saw him suffering from electrical shock. She ran to help him and stepped into a water puddle, which had electricity running through it causing her to be electrocuted. Just before she fell, her head hit a generator box and she collapsed. When Shane found her, he and Derek rushed her into surgery. Although\uathey repaired her subdural brain bleed,\uashe died on the table due to too much swelling in her brain. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n\nDespite the fact that she died before she finished her internship, a personalized lab coat was accidentally made for her which Shane found in an empty cubby when the interns moved into the residents' lounge.\ua\n\n\nHeather Brooks was overly energetic and enthusiastic about nearly everything, and because of this her more serious fellow doctors found her to be annoying. Heather was known for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time and being utterly awkward to no end. She was also a bit sarcastic in nature and often told weird, sometimes unsettling jokes. Although sometimes endearing, Heather was not well-liked at the hospital and upon her death, her fellow interns could not think of one nice story to tell her mother. Instead, they told stories stolen from Meredith about George and their own experiences with each other. They did, however, admit to being upset over her death. Heather was also compassionate and caring, proven by the fact that she frequently treated the poor and uninsured under the table in the ER. She had a gift for neuro.\n\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShe had a brief sexual relationship with [[Alex Karev]]. She said she found having sex easier than talking, so it made her less nervous around him.\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nWhen she replaced Dr. Ross on Shepherd's service, Derek took a liking to her. He would often try to make her feel confident in her natural ability and talent as a neurosurgeon. He also encouraged and embraced her weirdness.\n\n\nHeather was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. It was noted by [[Derek Shepherd]] that she had a natural talent for [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgery]] and he began to cultivate that talent by mentoring her, though she was not as enthusiastic about it as Shepherd hoped. Brooks, as he pointed out, often acted weird to cover up her lack of confidence in her natural ability, though after Heather finished the surgery on [[Paul Dawson]] on her own with full confidence, Derek told her to \"stay weird.\"\n\n\n*She ate dirt as a child.\n*She had social anxiety.\n*Her last words were: \"Oh crap! Dr. Webber!\". She said them when she found an unconscious [[Richard Webber|Richard]] on the floor in the hospital basement.\n*Cristina Yang wouldn\ut call her by her name up until her death. She therefore referred to her as Mousey referencing to the  dwarves; even though there wasn\ut a dwarf named Mousey. Yang finally called her by her real name while talking to Owen expressing that she was sorry about her death. ''(\"[[I Want You With Me]]\")''\n*She stuck a marble up her nose when she was six. Its location was revealed\uaby the \"LODOX\", a scanner that is able to make a full body scan in  seconds.<ref>[[Idle Hands]], x</ref>\n*She was roommates with [[Leah Murphy]].\n*When she was young, she had an imaginary brother who went everywhere with her.\n*She sometimes cried during sex.\n*Although most of the doctors didn't appreciate Heather's personality, Derek took an instant liking to her.\n*Although she was already dead at that point, she was issued her own [[Scrubs|lab coat]] with her name embroidered on it normally reserved for residents who have passed their [[United States Medical Licensing Exam#Step |intern exam]].\n*Heather treated many unhoused and uninsured patients \"under the table\", meaning she didn't charge them for her time or the medical supplies she used on them. This is reminiscent of [[Izzie Stevens]] as she treated [[Ahn|a patient]] \"under the table\" early in [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|her intern year]]. [[Shane Ross|Shane]]\uahas since taken them in to honor her memory.\n*She appeared in Shane Ross's flashback in the OR while operating on [[James Evans]]\uaduring [[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], of how he sent her to the basement, which caused her unexpected death.\n*She was quick on her feet and had good reflexes, especially compared to Shane.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Going, Going, Gone]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Remember the Time]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[I Saw Her Standing There]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Beautiful Doom]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Second Opinion]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Love Turns You Upside Down]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Run, Baby, Run]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Things We Said Today]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[The End is the Beginning is the End]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[The Face of Change]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Hard Bargain]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[This is Why We Fight]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Transplant Wasteland]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Idle Hands]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[She's Killing Me]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Do You Believe in Magic]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Readiness is All]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Perfect Storm]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[Seal Our Fate]]\nxHeatherBrooks.png|[[I Want You With Me]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nPromo.jpg\nPromo.jpg\nPromo.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n:'''[[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]:''' Brooks, thanks.

On the first date, they had sex and Joan got pregnant. They decided to stay together and get to know each other because of the baby coming.\n\nJoan went into labor one morning. The doctor said she could wait, but she insisted that Keith take her to the hospital right away. He wanted to take the bridge, but she insisted on the tunnel, because it's faster.\n\n\nWhile they were driving through the tunnel, it collapsed, injuring both of them and trapping them in a car. The rescue workers were able to get Joan out and to the hospital, but Keith remained trapped.\n\n[[Andrew DeLuca]], on his way to his first day of work as an intern, came upon the scene and stopped to help. He rode in the rig with Joan, reducing her arm and using his tie to splint it. Once they arrived at the hospital, they put a fetal monitor on Joan and paged [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] and [[Callie Torres|Callie]]. Films revealed that Joan's neck was fractured, but not dislocated. Since it was stable, Callie said fixing it could wait until after she delivered. Arizona said that Joan was only at  centimeters dilated and to page when she was closer.\n\nThe interns later prepared Joan for surgery while discussing Keith and how they believed he'd been left because there was nothing they could do, not knowing that Joan and Keith were engaged. Joan started to panic and said she couldn't breathe, so [[Mitchell Spencer]], believing it was the collar, loosened it a little. Stephanie stepped in the room just in time to see him do that and to hear Joan's neck crack when it dislocated. Joan said there were shocks running through her body, so Stephanie raced to stabilize her neck and had Callie and Arizona paged. The baby was in distress, so they slowly and carefully started to move Joan for delivery. While they were in an elevator, Joan started to regain feeling in her body. Then she had a contraction and was warned that even though it hurt, they needed her not to move. She started bleeding and Arizona checked and saw that she was crowning, so they prepared for delivery in the elevator. Joan and Keith's son was quickly delivered. Joan lamented that Keith was supposed to be there to cut the cord and hear the first cry as Arizona put the baby on her chest. ''(\"[[Time Stops]]\")''\n\n\nSoon after her son's birth, she started having unusual bleeding, so her baby was taken to the NICU to be monitored while she was rushed into surgery. Arizona diagnosed Uterine Atony and placed a balloon catheter to stop the bleeding while Callie and Amelia worked on her neck. Both procedures were successful and she was awake after surgery and not paralyzed, though she had weakness on her right side.\n\nLater, while checking on Joan despite having been removed from the case, Stephanie saw that Joan was having trouble breathing. She opened her collar and saw bleeding in her neck, so she opened her up bedside to do what she could before Joan was taken back into surgery. They were able to stop the bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm and Joan was awake after surgery and expected to make a full recovery.

The relationship probably would not have lasted, but Joan got pregnant on the first date, so they stuck it out and they planned to get married the week after the baby was born.

While they were on their way, they were passed by several security guards and Stephanie got word that a patient had been raped. Keith, knowing he was near being caught, held Stephanie with a scalpel and told her to lead him out of the building without being seen. She started taking him down the stairs to the loading dock, but on their way out, a lockdown was activated, trapping them in a secluded part of the hospital with [[Erin Miller]], who had wandered away from her parents. Stephanie told Keith that unless security called the lockdown off or an emergency forced the doors to release. He had the idea to start a fire and had Erin help him gather the supplies to do so. Once he had the fire started and held it up to the sprinkler, Stephanie sprayed him with alcohol, causing him to catch fire rapidly. Once he was on fire, he started crawling toward some oxygen tanks. Seeing this, Stephanie told Erin to go as far away from them as she could and then ran toward Keith just as the oxygen tanks exploded.

They did what they could to stop the bleeding and then stepped away to discuss options. Since none of the options were really workable, April said he was a black tag. There was nothing more they could do. She sent the other three back to the hospital and said she'd stay while they cut Keith out and do what she could for him.\n\nThey were then surprised when April showed up at the hospital with Keith still trapped in his car.

So they stopped and decided to start the exploratory laparotomy outside and clamp off everything they could before rushing him inside to repair the damage. Keith began to express doubt that he'd live through it, so Meredith talked to Alex and they brought Keith and Joan's son outside to see him. When they took the baby away and got ready, Keith said it was a bad idea, because now that he'd seen his son, he'd be pissed if\uait didn't work and he died. The doctors then sedated Keith and got to work. Owen and April clamped off every bleeder they could and then rushed him inside, where a path to the only available OR, a plastics OR, had been made.

He was shocked to learn that he'd be awake and playing the guitar during his surgery.\n\nThey started the procedure and Kyle played as they tested different areas. When Kyle's face started to droop, they realized he had a slight brain bleed. They repaired the bleeding and he played guitar for them so they could target the DBS to treat his tremor.\n\nAfter his procedure, Kyle was awake and stable. He talked to Stephanie about her professional jealousy, saying he'd experienced that on the other end himself. He then decided to sleep as she stayed to watch him as she'd been assigned to do. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Kyle developed another tremor, this time in his left hand, Stephanie made him come in. He was worried about missing his last three tour dates, but he was told his tremor would get worse if they didn't treat it immediately. When an MRI showed an abnormality, they planned a second round of DBS. It was successfully performed. ''(\"[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]]\")''\n\n\nKyle later returned to the ER with what looked like meningitis. ''(\"[[Mama Tried]]\")''\n\nTo be treated for the infection, Kyle had to have his implant removed, which brought back his tremor. He was aggressively treated, but the infection started spreading to his ventricles, so he needed drainage and washout to clean out the infection. He was taken in for surgery, but he started to code and was pronounced dead in the OR. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe heavily flirted with [[Stephanie Edwards]] during his hospitalization. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\nShe agreed to text him during his tour and said they might be able to go out when he got back. They ended up exchanging dirty texts. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\nWhen Kyle came back into town, he asked Stephanie to go out with him. She tried to decline, worried that what they had was all texts, but he showed up at the hospital and she agreed to go with him when he said he wanted to take her somewhere special. She went with him to a recording studio, where they started to kiss and then undress and had sex. ''(\"[[Trigger Happy]]\")''\n\nThey continued to see each other, though without labelling their relationship. When Kyle developed a tremor in his other hand, Stephanie told him to go to the hospital, where she stayed by his side as he waited for surgery, and waited in the waiting room while he was in surgery. After his surgery, she came to visit him before he woke up and left a note, ending things between them.

''(\"[[Mama Tried]]\")''\n\nWhen he ended up back in the hospital with meningitis, he initially tried to push her away, but they reconciled briefly and he tried to convince her to come with him to his European concerts. However, shortly after this, he was taken into surgery, where he died while she watched from the gallery. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\n\nHis mother and sister are very protective of him.

And now I'm in an OR with the Maggie Pierce... |'''Leah Murphy''' to '''[[Maggie Pierce]]'''}}\n\n'''Leah Murphy'''\uais a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She was fired during her second year of residency because she wasn't fit to be a surgeon, but later returned to their residency program after working hard to improve herself at another hospital.\n\n\n\nWhen she was , she believed she wanted to be a radiologist. Her mother briefly dated\ua[[Mark Sloan]] and he helped Leah to get in the surgical program at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n\nA couple of months into her internship, Leah started to make out with Alex in a supply closet for the last time before he left for Hopkins. They had had sex a couple of times already, as Alex slept with nearly every intern. Just as he was giving her the goodbye speech he used on every other intern, they were interrupted by Callie, who was crying in the closet as they came in kissing. Leah apologized and quickly got out of the room. While watching the intern appy, the interns talked about how mean [[Meredith Grey|Medusa]] was and Leah questioned if Medusa had always been Medusa. They soon stopped when Owen pointed out that the intercom was on and Meredith had heard everything they said. Along with the others, Leah was shocked as Meredith bumped Jo aside when she froze in the OR.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nDuring one of Derek's boring lectures about inserting a central line, Leah talked to Jo and Stephanie about a patient in the hospital with scrotal lymphedema. During a practice, Leah was shown not to be very good at placing central lines, as she still didn't manage to do it correctly after several failed attempts. The next day, she, Jo, and Stephanie went to look at Brian's giant testicles, about which Leah kind of exaggerated as she described them as \"so big a sheet couldn't cover them\", until Meredith chased them away. Before Derek could start another lecture, they asked him if they could go watch Meredith remove the rare tumor. He thought Meredith wasn't removing a tumor, as she had told him she wasn't going to do it, but he stormed out when Leah told him she and Dr. Brooks were in the OR at that moment.<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jo brought up how mean Alex was to her, Leah asked Jo if he said anything about her. Stephanie told her not to be the sad girl with the hang-up, as it's pathetic. She asked why she'd even start her year with having sex with her boss. \"Because he's stupid hot!\" Leah replied. However, Leah didn't let it go and later approached Jo. She asked if it may be something that she did to make him stop talking to her. She didn't understand, as things were really heating up and suddenly, he stopped returning her texts. He barely talked to her and she couldn't figure out what happened between them. Jo told her what happened is that he's a guy. Leah asked if that meant they were done. Jo simply said that she should be done with him, but Leah still asked if he was done. Jo told her to stop and proposed she started something with Shane as he was nice, but unfortunately, she didn't like nice. Jo pointed out that she picked the right guy then, as Karev was mean. And thoughtless and a douche, Leah added. That day, Leah was on Bailey's service. Bailey planned to get Arizona back to the hospital and acted as if she had ordered Leah to deliver a chart at Arizona's house, though she hadn't ordered Leah anything and used Leah's \"stupidness\" as an excuse to make Arizona come to the hospital for the chart.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nWhile competing with [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] while they were both on [[Cristina Yang|Cristina's]] service, they were both indefinitely banned from the OR when their fighting led to Leah hooking up a [[Mrs. Crossley|patient's]] oxygen to her IV, a potentially fatal mistake.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n\nShe sat with [[Richard Webber]] while Bailey and Meredith operated on [[Adele Webber|Adele]] and he explained to her, everything that they were doing.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah was on Bailey's service, afraid to make another mistake and be thrown off, seeing as she'd already messed up two times. When she and Bailey checked\ua[[Joyce Basche]], a person they had performed a surgery on weeks before, she had a post-operative infection. Soon after, another former patient of theirs came up with the same infection. Leah was in charge of both of their post-op care, and Leah had a cold the day she operated on both of them with Bailey. When\ua[[Seth Lepik]]\uashowed up with the infection, Leah seemed doomed, but as it turned out, she never touched Seth, and the only doctor who touched all three patients was Bailey. Bailey was found as the source of the infection, so Leah was innocent the whole time.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile the hospital was dealing with the mudslide patients, [[Heather Brooks|Heather]] was being treated. When Leah went to scrub in on a surgery, [[Callie Torres|Callie]] offered to give her time if she needed it, but she declined and scrubbed in. She, Stephanie, and Jo later got into a disagreement over whether or not Stephanie liked Heather.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Heather died, the other interns were given time off. Derek told them to think of happy Heather stories for her mother, but they realized they didn't have any as they were not very close to her. They went to Meredith and she told them a story about George stealing jello for all of them, a story she had shared with George's mother when he died. They used alcohol from Alex to get drunk and bond, but when Heather's mother arrived, they still didn't have a story to tell her, so they stole Meredith's George story, as well as using a question Stephanie had asked Jo and changing it to involve Heather. Using their newfound bond, the four of them went out to the pile as a group to help.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the interns began all sleeping at Alex's house and studying. Jo was waiting for Alex to proposition her so they could have sex and Alex was waiting because he thought she was still grieving, so he said they could stay there as long as they wanted. Jo went to the others and said that they needed to leave.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn the night of the\ua[[Puttin' on the Ritz|fundraising gala]], [[Arizona Robbins]]\uaand\ua[[April Kepner]]\uabonded over drinks in the hospital storage closet. Since they were too intoxicated to drive, Leah called them a cab. Shortly thereafter, Leah called to make sure the girls arrived home safely and ended up visiting Arizona at her apartment. The two watched movies and talked all night (though Arizona remembered none of it). Worried about what took place that night, Arizona asked Leah if anything happened between them and Leah told her nothing had.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, the two ended up making out on a different occasion, causing Leah to become somewhat obsessed with Arizona (much like she did with Alex). Arizona rebuffed her obsession and ended things. Leah told Arizona that she respected her so much and the thought of Arizona thinking about her in that way made her feel amazing. That night, Arizona texted Leah asking 'What are you up to?' implying that she wanted her to come over.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nOn the morning of\ua[[Thriller|Halloween]], Leah woke up in Arizona's hotel bed. She got ready to leave, waking up Arizona. Arizona said that she didn't have to leave. Leah said she knew she wasn't supposed to sleep over and apologized, but Arizona said it was okay. Leah thought it wasn't, as she was all about easy. At the hospital, Leah got bit in the neck by a drug addict and was tested for HIV. Arizona helped calm her worry. She told Leah a similar story to reach out to her. Her rapid HIV test was negative.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nWhen talking about April's wedding, Leah said she didn't want to go because she didn't want to see Arizona being beautiful there. Later, she decided she was going to go to the wedding and demand what she felt she deserved, but she immediately figured out that that was a bad idea.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nShe agreed to cover Jo's patients for her while Jo went to April's wedding, but was over her hours, so Shane showed her how to modify her hours so it looked like she worked fewer hours than she had. While Jo was gone, Jimmy had a heart attack. She and Shane took him into surgery by themselves. In surgery, Shane began to panic after things went poorly and started to refer to the patient as \"she,\" so Leah left the OR to find someone. She found Richard and brought him back into the OR so he could attempt to fix the damage Shane had done. By the time Richard got back into the OR, Shane had completely frozen and was just staring into Jimmy's chest cavity. Richard talked to Shane and sent him out of the OR so he could operate.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\nAfterward, she looked for Shane and wasn't able to find him.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter finding Stephanie miserable on the stairs and talking to her about how Jackson treated Stephanie and Arizona treated Leah, Leah decided that someone should do something about it.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\nShe filed a sexual harassment claim, which resulted in a non-fraternization policy being enacted at the hospital.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that Leah had filed the complaint against [[Callie Torres|Callie]], not [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] as previously believed. When Arizona tried to send Leah away when she came to scrub in with her, Leah asked if she really wanted to do that. Arizona operated with Leah and taught her during the surgery.<ref>[[Throwing it All Away]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of who had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAt Richard's birthday party, Owen asked him to be director of the residency program because he noticed how well he'd been mentoring the residents.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Leah contracted the virus that was going around the hospital, Richard encouraged her not to go home. She attempted to power through, even hooking herself up to an IV while operating, but was ultimately sent home when she vomited in the OR behind her mask.<ref>[[You Be Illin']], x</ref>\n\nDerek, warned that he wasn't teaching enough, took all the residents to work on a case with him that he had rescheduled several times. As the OR wasn't available until  AM, he then took them to the ER to work on the incoming patients, including having them work on a patient who was already dead so they could work with real brain tissue. When a man came in with scissors puncturing his forehead, they took him into an OR for a controlled extraction. When Leah was unable to pull them out quickly, Jo took over and pulled them out. Then they went back to the case of [[Nova Jenkins]]. Each of the residents took a turn to step up to the microscope and ask a question so they could learn. When it was Leah's turn, she made a mistake that could have caused permanent damage. However, after surgery, Nova woke up and was responsive. Derek told Leah she got lucky, but next time, she might not get so lucky. He encouraged her to remember the feeling of not knowing rather than the feeling of relief, so she wouldn't make the same mistake again.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working on [[Francesca McNeil]], Leah had to put a stitch in a heart that she had never done before. She did the stitch successfully, but there were other complications and Frankie died in the OR. She spoke to Shane, who assured her that it was nothing that she did.<ref>[[Change of Heart]], x</ref>\n\n\nThe residents were part of the group operating on [[Annie Cooper (We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together)|Annie]] and [[Liz Cooper]]. Leah was selected to do the burr holes, but she was nervous about it because she had previously drilled through a table. In surgery, she was able to do the burr holes without puncturing the dura.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter hearing that a resident was going to be fired, Leah began to stress eat. Richard invited her to work with him that day. When she came up with the idea to use a magnetic sphincter normally used at the bottom of the esophagus in a patient's anus, she scrubbed in on the surgery with Richard. He coached her throughout the surgery. Leah asked to stay on the case and be there for follow-ups, but Richard pulled her aside and told her that her surgical skills were lacking. She was an excellent doctor, but surgery was not the right fit for her. He told her to find where she could be great and offered to put in a good word for her at a research facility.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Leah heard about the [[Mall Explosion|explosion]] at the mall, she came into the hospital even though she had been fired. She worked on several patients, but once things had calmed down and there wasn't anything for her to do, she took off her gown and left the hospital.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter leaving Grey Sloan, Leah worked at Foster Hospital. She spent the time improving her skills and discovering that she wanted to be a cardiothoracic surgeon. In particular, she wanted to study under [[Maggie Pierce]] after reading a paper she'd published. When she learned Maggie was working at Grey Sloan, she worked to get re-hired there.<ref>[[Roar]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah was ultimately re-hired after proving herself. Her return was immediately awkward, with multiple doctors speculating about why she had returned and what would happen. Despite this, Maggie took a shine to her after seeing her technique. When Maggie learned that Leah had previously been fired, she observed Leah more closely in surgery and quizzed her as she worked. Leah knew what she was doing and then told Maggie what she'd done to earn her spot back at the hospital.<ref>[[Roar]], x</ref>\n\nDespite all her hard work, Leah admitted she sometimes still had trouble following Maggie's train of thought, making it difficult to learn from her. Leah presumably told\ua[[Eliza Minnick]], the education consultant hired by Bailey, about this during the meeting with the residents and interns.<ref>[[Why Try to Change Me Now]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a building collapsed, the hospital was flooded with incoming traumas. Leah treated [[Micah (You Haven't Done Nothin')|Micah]], who asked for a priest. When one wasn't available, Leah brought Ben to talk to Micah instead and they were both shocked to learn that Micah, the landlord, knew the building wasn't structurally sound.<ref>[[You Haven't Done Nothin']], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter Jo had been sent home to get some sleep, Leah and Stephanie brought over pizza. Jo tried to send them away, but agreed to let them come in. Stephanie wanted to have a strategy session, to talk about what to do to improve their chances. They then surprised her by telling her Alex wasn't in prison as she thought.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah tended to [[Matty]] when he came into the ER. However, Stephanie took over the case shortly afterward.<ref>[[It Only Gets Much Worse]], x</ref>\n\n\nLeah Murphy is the perfect example of a mean girl on the outside, but a sweet and complex girl on the inside. She comes across as somewhat cold and selfish, but in fact she cares a great deal about the people around her. Like her fellow interns, she is very competitive, but she is also very insecure (about her skills and herself in general). Leah also tends to become infatuated with anyone who shows the smallest bit of interest in her (which stems from her insecurities).\n\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShe had a brief sexual relationship with [[Alex Karev]]. Contrary to him, she thought it was more than just sex and got really attached to him. He then broke off their relationship, after which she obsessed about why he stopped contacting her.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nOn the night of the fundraising gala, [[Arizona Robbins]] and [[April Kepner]] bonded over drinks in the hospital storage closet. Since they were too intoxicated to drive, Leah called them a cab.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref> Shortly thereafter, Leah called to make sure the girls arrived home safely and ended up visiting Arizona at her apartment.

That night Arizona texted Leah saying 'What are you up to?' implying that she wanted her to come over.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Halloween, Leah woke up next to Arizona in her hotel room. She got ready to leave, waking up Arizona. Arizona said that she didn't have to leave. Leah said she knew she wasn't supposed to sleep over and apologized, but Arizona said it was okay.

[[Callie Torres|Callie]] describes her job as \"mostly she just sits around in her office and spreads prestige around, but she still does routine surgery now and then.\" She identifies herself as a God with a scalpel.\n\nIt was hinted that she taught Richard Webber and it has been years since he's been in her OR, and does not let him forget the time he dropped a clamp into an open body cavity. She worked with Ellis Grey, as is documented in [[Ellis Grey's Journals|her journal]], March rd , where Ellis assisted her on a splenectomy (surgical removal of a spleen), and is described as \"impressive r\uesum\ue, adequate technique\".\n\nCristina calls her \"a dinosaur that refuses to retire her scalpel\" after she does not use laparoscopic methods for a cholecystectomy on her patient, [[John Terzian]], who developed a post-operative infection, severe enough that Callie believe the infection is the reason Mr. Terzian collapsed. On a the [[Computed Tomography|CT]] scan, Cristina and Owen find a lacerated bowel duct and artery from her surgery; a mistake that should not have been made, open surgery or not.\n\nAs one of the most senior [[Surgery#Surgical Specialties|surgical]] [[Attending|attendings]] at Seattle Grace, she outranks [[Owen Hunt]] and he is forced to defend her choice of open surgery instead of minimally invasive surgery when explaining the problem to the patient, in contrast to Cristina's criticism of Dr. Campbell's choice of procedure.\n\nDuring surgery, she teaches Cristina, after criticizing the new teaching methods of inspiration, using the her methods of fear and shame she was taught with, asking Cristina how to perform a pulmonary embolectomy (removing a clot in the pulmonary vessels). Cristina correctly and accurately describes the procedure using \"newer\" methods (inserting a steel wire catheter into the femoral vein and removing the clot using a fluoroscope for guidance by placing the scope adjacent to the embolism), to which Dr. Campbell retorts with a power failure, or a hospital without a fluoroscope, leaving Yang speechless, and Dr. Campbell makes her point using an analogy of teaching mental arithmetic to young children and the use of calculators. Cristina fights back by with \"If it will help them to to avoid mistakes like this one\", infuriating Dr. Campbell and being kicked out of the [[Operating Room|OR]].\n\nFollowing the surgery to repair her original botched procedure, Owen confides that he was discharged from the army because they knew it was his time, and this prompts Dr. Campbell to retire because Richard is reluctant to fire her. And it is while she decides to retire is when Yang finally has an answer for her, using old-fashioned manual removal methods to remove an embolus. Dr. Campbell commends her, for finding her and for giving the correct answer, leading her to conclude she will be a much better surgeon than she initially thought, pleasing Cristina.\n\n\n*When Faye Dunaway was cast, she learned her procedure by heart so she could probably perform the procedure in reality with enough practice and equipment.\n*Dr. Campbell has been the only non-regular character featured as a staff [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] in\ua[[Grey's Anatomy]].\n\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:Margaret Campbell]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Campbell, Margaret}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

They reached a point of diminishing returns, so they packed her and took her to the ICU.\n\nThe next morning, her lung collapsed and they had to put in a chest tube. Later that day, Meredith decided it was time to go back in. They were able to stop the bleeding and Melissa woke up in the ICU after surgery and asked for Meredith.

Because she wasn't in combat areas, when she returned to the US, she was reluctant to take advantage of services meant to help veterans, feeling that it would take them away from soldiers who were injured during their service. However, after her surgery, Owen talked to her and convinced her that she had given what she was able to give, but had still served her country, meaning she was entitled to the same services as those who had served in combat. He also encouraged her to volunteer, working to help other veterans, but told her that she needed to get back on her own feet before she could do that.\n\n\nWhen Melissa returned to the US after serving in Iraq, she found that the job she had lined up was gone and her fianc\ue, as well as the apartment they shared, was gone as well. She was only able to find work at Office Hub, but it didn't pay well enough to afford rent, so she began living out of her car. One day, while she was sleeping, carjackers broke her window and tried to pull her out of the car. She tried to hang on as long as she could and was dragged by the car for a while. But the carjackers punched and kicked her until she couldn't hold on any longer. She was found by a co-worker, [[Keith (Don't Let's Start)|Keith]], on his way into work. He called an ambulance and she was taken to the ER.\n\nAt the hospital, she was taken into a trauma room, where they had to perform an emergency laparotomy as they didn't have time to take her to an OR. Once they had packed her abdomen, she was taken to the OR, where her internal injuries were repaired and her leg fracture was cleaned out. Her tibia repair was scheduled for the following day. When she woke after her first surgery, she was concerned about her car. The police said they found the pieces of it in a chop shop, which was devastating for her as the car was all she had. It held all of her belongings and her clothes, as well as all her savings and her insurance paperwork.\n\nHer tibia repair went well, but afterward, the doctors talked to her about her homelessness and offered to set her up with services for homeless veterans. She declined their offers and asked them not to say anything to her co-workers, who had come to her hospital room to see her.\n\nOwen later came into her room with pamphlets for the programs, pulling rank on her to force her to listen to him before explaining to her why she had the right to them as much as any other veteran.\n\n\n\nMelissa was engaged. However, when she finished her service in the Army, she came back to find that her fianc\ue had left her.\n\n\nHer co-workers, [[Keith (Don't Let's Start)|Keith]], [[Jacki]], and [[Caroline]], came to visit her in the hospital, despite professing that they don't know her that well.

While they were operating, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] thought of alternatives to why Brooke might have driven off the bridge other than just snapping under the pressure. She suggested an insulinoma, a tumor on the pancreas which would cause an extra secretion of insulin, which explained all her symptoms, including the low blood sugar she had in the ER. They did a trauma whipple to repair the other damage while pathology reviewed her scans, looking for the tumor. They came up with nothing, but Meredith was still convinced it was there, so she looked by hand. It was small, about the size of the head of a pin, but it was there. They removed it and in recovery, they told her husband that all her symptoms, the fatigue, irritability, and stress, were all due to the tumor and now that they had removed it, she'd make a full recovery.\n\n\n\nMia lives with her parents and her brother, Parker.

To buy Dominic more time, they applied a tourniquet above the grinder.\n\nOnce they got it apart, Callie told his brothers to leave while they turned back the auger and released Dominic's hand. They didn't leave right away and when his hand was pulled out, they both passed out on the floor. His hand was severely injured and only two of his fingers were left attached. While Meredith and Callie were in the OR working on Dominic's hand, Meredith determined that one of his amputated fingers was still viable and could be reattached, but Callie said the thumb wasn't, so Dominic would be better off with a prosthetic as the thumb is responsible for % of hand function. Meredith suggested that they take his big toe to replace his thumb, but Callie said that his big toe is too important for his balance, so they'd take the second toe instead. They closed and went to get Dominic's consent.\n\nDominic's brothers thought it was weird, but Dominic agreed to the surgery. They took him back in and retrieved his second toe and attached it in place of his lost thumb.\n\n\n\nMike owns a butcher shop with his two brothers, Dominic and Tommy.

Since her husband, Bryan, was out shopping, she called a taxi. [[Steve Duncan]] came and told her to get in the front seat so she could recline. He then started a video chat with the hospital so he could give them information as he drove to the hospital. When they were only a few blocks away, Arizona told Mindy to put her legs up when she felt the baby descend so she'd be more comfortable. Shortly after that, they were hit by another car.\n\nThe doctors rushed out to the car to get Mindy into the hospital. In the ER, she had a strong fetal heartbeat, but an x-ray showed that both her hips were dislocated and broken, forcing the bones upward into her chest and abdomen, a result of having her feet up on the dashboard. She was taken for a CT, which showed a splenic laceration and internal bleeding. She was rushed into an emergency surgery, first to deliver the baby and then to repair her injuries. She asked if her husband could be there for the birth, since she was going to be unconscious herself. Arizona agreed, but said he'd need to leave immediately after the birth. Before she was anesthetized, Mindy noticed the scratches on her husband's face and against Arizona's advice, he revealed he was the one who had hit her on his way to the hospital.\n\nOnce Mindy was out, the baby was delivered and didn't breathe right away. They determined that she had a diaphragmatic hernia. Arizona had to leave Mindy's surgery to operate on the baby. Maggie finished her surgery and her husband was told she was alive, but still not out of the woods.

He wanted to page an attending, but Ben said he'd open him up and sent Mitchell to get an open chest tray. Mitchell left and came back with [[Richard Webber]], who was startled and angry to see that Ben had used a clipboard to open the patient's chest.

After hours of arguing with Evelyn and the kids complaining, their father just pulled over at a beach and they played there for hours until the sun went down. It was one of the best experiences of his childhood.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x</ref>\n\nWhen he was almost  years old, he won a science award at school and ran home with the certificate. Before he could show his mother, she sat him down and told him that his father had died that day. On top of the grief of losing his father, Owen felt enormous guilt over having been so happy and proud while his mother had had such a bad day.\n\nHe attended [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard]]. He did his [[Resident|residency]] at [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] and then worked at Maryland Shock Trauma before commissioning in the army and becoming an army trauma surgeon.\n\n\nWhen Richard Webber offered Owen a job, he initially declined the offer because he hadn't finished his army tour in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Owen first came to Seattle Grace, to care for his patients as a Major, he and Cristina had an instant bond. At the same time, Cristina had slipped and been impaled with an icicle, so she was admitted to the hospital as a patient. Owen was there to pull it out and then later kissed her. He then returned after a short time and Cristina and Owen started dating. Cristina first started seeing signs of Owen's ongoing PTSD when Owen had a terrible nightmare due to the blades of the ceiling fan spinning, which was what he last saw before he fell asleep. In his sleep, Owen was strangling Cristina almost to the point of her death. Callie woke up due to the noise just as Owen woke up. It was later revealed in his nightmare Owen was trying to save himself.\n\nOwen immediately wanted to break up with Cristina, due to his sorrow and fear that he might do something like that again to her. Cristina fought it, saying that she was fine and understood why he did what he did. But later, after they had sex for the first time, Cristina admitted she couldn't take it, causing them to break up.\n\n\nWhile Cristina and Jackson were trying to save Derek's life after he was shot, the shooter shot Owen. Cristina told Meredith to take him to another OR and get the bullet out.<ref>[[Death and All His Friends]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Cristina got pregnant, she stuck to her point of never wanting children and refused to have a proper discussion about with Owen, as she thinks a child should only be welcomed into a family where both parents want it. Thus, she scheduled an appointment for an abortion. He got angry about her decision and the fact that she didn't include him in it and threw her out of their house.\n\nOwen teamed up with Derek, who split up with Meredith over her tampering with his trial, and they started working on Derek's dream house while both claiming not to care about their wives anymore. Owen avoided Cristina and her calls, not knowing that she wanted to tell him she hadn't gotten the abortion yet. He heard about this from Meredith, who told him that Cristina couldn't do it because of her love for him. If Cristina were to have a child, she'd almost be killed pretending to love the kid as much as she loves surgery, which would also kill the kid. Meredith pointed out that she knows what it feels like to be raised by a Cristina and she made Owen realize that the guilt of resenting her own kid would eat Cristina, the woman he loves, alive.<ref>[[Free Falling]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith's speech and the fact that Cristina didn't have the abortion yet made Owen stop resenting Cristina. He searched for Cristina and asked her to sit down with him and talk. She asked him to postpone, as she was in the middle of trying to fix Meredith's abduction of Zola. Owen agreed and went to check up on [[Danny Wilson]], who made him realize that sometimes in a marriage, it's best to forget things and move on if the love is strong enough. He realized that that was the case in his marriage too. He and Cristina finally found time to talk and he asked her when the abortion appointment was. It was scheduled right then. \"Let's go,\" he said, making her cry because she finally felt like he understood her. In the doctor's office, an emotional Cristina assured the doctor she really wanted the abortion. The doctor then started the procedure, during which Owen held her hand.<ref>[[She's Gone]], x</ref>\n\n\nThey didn't talk after the abortion, having them struggle to find normalcy in their relationship again, as they were only able to have some small talk about dinner. Owen got promoted to Chief of Surgery, giving him even more professional duties. He and Cristina ordered Chinese from a bad restaurant, rendering them both sick on the bathroom floor and bringing them a little closer together.<ref>[[Take the Lead]], x</ref>\n\nHowever, just because he showed up for her at the abortion, Owen still was mad at Cristina for doing it. They avoided talking about it by just having sex. At Zola's birthday party, an argument about their work caused all of his frustrations to come. He yelled that she shattered all his hopes and dreams and the kind of life that he envisioned for himself, ultimately yelling in front of all their friends that she killed their baby.\n\nThey avoided each other until Valentine's Day when he saved her from being hit by a van crashing into the ER. She thanked him, but he nodded shortly and left her. Later that day, he told her he'd be moving out. This made her cry and she realized that she did not want him to leave her. She found him in the vent room and begged him (which she had refused to do) not to hate her, finally making physical contact again after weeks of avoiding each other.\n\nThey decided to go into couple's therapy, but they only ended up screaming at each other about their flaws and what they had been through, not making actual progress and putting them in a bad place again. This caused Owen to sleep with a woman he met at the hospital, a friend of his patient. He initially didn't tell Cristina, but her intuition told her he was sleeping with someone. After she couldn't find proof, she told him they needed to talk because it was driving her crazy, to the point that she suspected him to be cheating on her with nurse Emily. He said it hurt to love her and that he did not cheat on her with Emily, but that he did cheat on her.\n\nA mad Cristina then started ignoring him for days, finally communicating again when she outed her anger by throwing her bowl of cereal in his face. They later stayed home, pretending to have the flu, because Cristina wanted to hear about the cheating. He didn't want to talk about it in order not to hurt her, but she forced him to do it anyway. After a day of talking, it turned out that Owen, possibly subconsciously, did it in order to hurt Cristina back for the abortion. Cristina then threw him out of their firehouse, but eventually let him move back in as she was staying at Meredith's to study for the boards.\n\n\nAfter the plane crash survivors decided to not settle and sue instead, the hospital was at fault and originally, the insurance was supposed to pay the survivors, but after it was realized that only two attendings were allowed on a mediplane, the insurance company wouldn't pay, leaving the hospital to declare bankruptcy. Owen wanted Pegasus to buy the hospital, but in the end, the plane crash survivors and Callie bought the hospital with the settlement money, plus additional funding from the Harper Avery Foundation.\n\n\nAfter Russell quit, Owen contemplated giving Cristina the job of Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery so she wouldn't leave for Zurich. He had her do interviews with other candidates and while they were all fine, she didn't think one stood out. He reminded her they couldn't all be as good as her. At the end of the day, she still hadn't picked anyone and he said the Harper Avery Foundation was looking for a way to mend fences, and he suggested a large infusion of cash into the cardio department. Cristina figured out he wanted to offer her the job and told him not to. He confessed he had wanted to, but he realized she had to go. He only asked not to leave him until she was actually leaving. She agreed to this and they shared a kiss, briefly rekindling their romance once again.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a few weeks, the day came for Cristina's departure. She slept over that night to have one great night together but promised to meet him at the hospital for their own big goodbye. Cristina left to get a European charger for her phone at the mall, and later Owen saw on the news that the mall was supposedly bombed. While handling the crisis at the hospital, he feared Cristina got hurt, but she turned out fine at the hospital. However, they never found time to talk as he had to handle the crisis and media attention all the while treating patients who suffered from chemical burns. The big goodbye resulted in Cristina appearing in the gallery as Owen was operating. They shared a loving look and she waved, disappearing after he turned to the patient for a few seconds.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\nOwen dove into work to occupy his mind. Unbeknownst to him, April tried to look out for him, thinking Owen was dying inside and encouraged his male colleagues to be there for him. Owen didn't really appreciate the attention as he just had to deal with Cristina being gone on his own without extra attention.<ref>[[I Must Have Lost It on the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nMaggie, who had replaced Cristina, took on solving the cause of the McNeil's cardiac malfunction and eventually found the cause to be a genetic mutation, which only recently had been discovered, so Cristina couldn't possibly have found it out at the time. Tying up that loose end that Cristina left behind helped Owen to get more closure.<ref>[[Puzzle With a Piece Missing]], x</ref>\n\nOwen teamed up with Callie to turn her research about robotic limbs into a project to help disabled veterans. He confessed to Callie that since Cristina, who was his family, was living her life happily without him, he needed something to get up in the morning and find new dreams. Cristina helped him get over the darkness that the Army left in him and he needed something to beat it back by doing something good.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], x</ref>\n\n\nOwen eventually grew closer with Amelia and slept with her in an on-call room. They soon got involved in a romantic relationship.\n\n\nOwen was one of the first people to hear about Derek's death when Meredith returned to the hospital. He admitted her after she lost consciousness and worried about Amelia's reaction, only to find out no one had told her as she was in surgery. He waited until she was done to deliver the news, with her already deriving from his facial expression that someone died. She claimed she was okay, having gone through it all before, and rejected his attempt to comfort her. Around Easter, a few weeks after Derek's death, Owen got an opportunity to do another Army tour. Owen accepted as he wanted to get away from it all, with Richard taking over his Chief duties at the hospital, and his talks about the Army convinced April to join him. Owen returned at the beginning of the next year, only to find Amelia in the middle of a mental breakdown at the hospital. Seeing Owen, still in his army uniform, embarrassed Amelia, and she walked off. He later found her stumbling around at Derek and Meredith's house, where she confessed that she scored oxy from a junkie doctor and that she was seriously considering taking it. Owen got through to her and made her realize that she shouldn't be managing her feelings or run away from them; she should allow herself to feel the pain, as that's the normal and human thing to do. As he pointed out, taking the oxy would cause her to spiral out of control. She handed him the oxy and she broke down in his arms as he comforted her.<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], x</ref>\n\nOwen shortly resumed his position as Chief of Surgery, only to reveal he was stepping down as he felt it was time for something else. Owen clashed with Jackson over an experimental procedure on a victim of a tunnel collapse and Owen pulled it off. It turned out well in the end, but Jackson still thought Owen got lucky. They talked about April, who changed after returning, and Owen concluded that's what often happens after an Army tour. It's what made him realize he didn't want to be Chief anymore, too.<ref>[[Time Stops]], x</ref>\n\nOwen also worked on Keith, the man who got trapped in his crushed car after the tunnel collapse. Afterward, he talked with Amelia. He misinterpreted what she said about something working out for a patient as if it was about two of them, and awkwardly left. He later found her sitting by herself in Meredith's bedroom. She received Meredith's old phone with Derek's last voice mail message, but couldn't bring herself to hit play. Owen did that for her and wanted to give her privacy, but she preferred him to stay. They listened to the message. Amelia got emotional, but she assured Owen she was okay. They returned to the party and danced it out.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\nAfter three months, Owen and Amelia were still doubtful as to what kind of relationship they were in. Owen had concert tickets and wanted to invite Amelia, but he wasn't sure if he should. He asked Callie for advice, and she told him he was overthinking it. In surgery, Owen noticed some tension between Meredith and Amelia, because of their fight over whether or not to tear down a wall at the house the three sisters were sharing. At the end of the day, Owen had to give Amelia a ride home as Meredith, with whom Amelia carpooled to work, left without her. As he dropped her off, he told her he didn't mind giving her a ride and kissed her. As Amelia wondered what that meant, Maggie came outside and dragged Amelia inside, leaving Owen outside on the front porch.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\nThe abrupt interruption left Owen to wonder what the kiss meant as he asked her out and Amelia spent the next day ignoring him. He vented his worries to April, but she was concerned about her own marriage and simply told him to go talk to Amelia. Owen ended up in an elevator with Amelia and asked her if she was angry or confused. She told the latter. Owen asked to talk, but she says that would just lead to them kissing again without them even knowing why. They wondered what it meant and just ended up kissing again.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], x</ref>\n\nOwen was invited to the sisters' dinner party, and Callie suggested they drive there together after her consult was done. He was dressed casually and she reminded him Amelia was there, suggesting to dress up more. They arrived, only to find a quiet and cold dinner party as Meredith just revealed Penny, Callie's girlfriend, was the one who killed Derek. Amelia got angry at Meredith for not informing her before about who Penny was and they yelled at each other. A frustrated Meredith yelled at Owen to get Amelia out of her sight. Owen took Amelia to her room where she calmed down. She wondered how he could always stay calm, but he pointed out he was far from perfect. He confessed that when he heard Cristina's plane crashed, he was briefly relieved because he'd always known she was going to leave him one day and if she died, they'd just be frozen in time forever without any painful or messy break-up. He pointed out he always makes things harder than they should be, them included. They agreed it wasn't the worse thing not to be perfect and snuggled on the bed.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n\n\nA few days later, Owen was at work when he encountered [[Nathan Riggs]] in the ambulance bay. Nathan informed him he worked with April back in Jordan and that he was here with a kid that required Jackson's expertise. Due to their obviously negative history, Owen made it clear that he didn't want Riggs around and told him to leave immediately after the surgery.<ref>[[The Me Nobody Knows]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a night shift, Owen was woken up by Amelia as she laid down with him in the on-call room. They cuddled and talked about her day until he got paged away. In the ER, he found Nathan working on one of Maggie's patients, much to his and Maggie's surprise. They went to Bailey, who revealed she had hired Nathan and simply forgot to tell Maggie. Owen went to Meredith to ask her how she could work with Penny given their horrible history, and he concluded he simply couldn't do what she was doing. Nathan being around triggered Owen's PTSD and intern Isaac found Owen hallucinating and shaking in an on-call room. Owen snapped out of it and told Nathan to leave. At the end of the day, Bailey wanted to introduce everyone to Nathan, but Owen made it clear they already knew each other. Owen stated Bailey made a mistake hiring him and blamed her, saying she should've asked around before hiring a complete stranger. Bailey offered to go talk it out, but he said it was done. He went to the ambulance bay to cool down and refused to talk to Amelia when she came over to try and help him. Meredith tried as well and he told her he didn't want to talk. Meredith revealed she promised Cristina not to let him get all dark and twisty and to be his person if he needed one. Owen said he didn't want to talk, but all Meredith needed to know was if they were hating Nathan. Owen nodded and replied that they were really, really hating him.<ref>[[Something Against You]], x</ref>\n\nA few days and night shifts later, Amelia tried to talk to Owen, but he blocked her off and stated he was fine, yet he still had a hateful look in his eyes every time he saw Nathan. That day, lots of burned firefighters came in one of which was John, Owen's mother's boyfriend. Owen found out when his mother appeared in the ER, looking for John. Owen checked John's chart and saw Meredith and Nathan were operating on him. He angrily went to the OR and requested that Maggie replace Nathan, but Nathan refused to leave per his request as he didn't work for Owen. Owen was forced to leave as he couldn't give a valid reason. Amelia noticed he was really bothered by Nathan working on John and asked why. Owen said he simply didn't want Nathan around his family and took off. Owen later argued with his mother, who didn't seem to have a problem with Nathan. Amelia chased after him afterward and again offered his help, but he firmly stated he didn't want her help on this. Owen and Nathan ran into each other in the ICU. Nathan tried to talk to him, mentioning he talked to \"ma\", Owen's mother. Owen told him to run far away and never come near his family again. Nathan replied they were his family too, which lead to Owen's punching Nathan twice. He said they weren't his family and took off. The news quickly spread. Meredith found Owen outside on a bench and told him Bailey was looking for him. She said he was getting himself in trouble. He replied he knew. Meredith then revealed she talked to his mother, saying she knew about his sister.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\n\nMegan returned after being found in a basement in a rebel-led neighborhood. She had been treated relatively well and was fine except for a frozen abdomen, which Meredith miraculously fixed by performing an abdominal wall transplant. Owen remained with Megan as she recovered. After finally being discharged from the hospital, she temporarily moved in with him until she decided to move to Malibu with her fianc\ue Nathan and her son Farouk. While those two went to the new house to prepare, Megan drove up there with Owen with the last of their stuff. During their trip, she and Owen resolved old feuds, and after pointing out that it was time for him to let go of some of his ideals, she dropped him off at the airport. He returned home and told Amelia he wanted to call it quits since it felt like he didn't really know her. She understood and they returned their rings. The two remained friends while occasionally hooking up.\n\nAmelia later stated her theory that their marriage was doomed from the beginning due to Owen having unresolved feelings for Teddy, which drove Owen to make a heat-of-the-moment decision to fly to Germany to see Teddy. Once there, he declared his love for her and they spent the day together. However, after Owen confessed that it was Amelia who told him to come - just after they had finished having sex themselves, no less - Teddy was enraged and kicked him out, refusing to speak to him anymore, and Owen returned to Seattle.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:xLeo.png|thumb|px|Owen and baby Leo.]]\nFinally deciding to act on his long dream of having children, Owen filed to foster-to-adopt. After a -hour shift, he received a surprise call that there was a social worker coming over with a baby. Panicking because he wasn't prepared at all, Owen called Amelia to help him clean the house and get everything ready. Amelia arrived with a marijuana-high Alex, whom she was babysitting, and they cleaned the house in preparation for the social worker's arrival. Owen ended up with a baby boy named Leo. Amelia then drove them to Meredith's house to get baby supplies while reassuring Owen, who feared he had forced becoming a father. Alex told him that him caring so much meant that it'd be alright, which settled his concerns. At the end of the day, Amelia decided to stay at Owen's to help him get through his first night as a parent.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nOwen took Leo for a six-month check-up at the hospital and met up with [[Betty Nelson]], Leo's birth mother. Amelia later joined them as they waited. After Arizona cleared him, Owen took Leo to daycare while Amelia spent time with Betty. She learned she was an addict and wanted to guide her sobriety. After checking in with the social worker, Amelia shared her plan with Owen, who offered to come live with him so Leo could have his mother in his life. Betty accepted the offer and they all went home while setting ground rules.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref> Owen took care of Leo while Amelia helped Betty through the worst stages of withdrawal. While he was at work, Betty ran off.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref> She returned after a few days and Owen informed Amelia. She claimed she had tried to get a fix but to no avail, so she squatted on a friend's couch until she missed Leo so bad that she had to come back. At work, [[Matthew Taylor]] was brought in after a car accident. They wanted to alert April but couldn't get a hold of her, so Owen had the paramedics bring him back to the site of the accident. He eventually found April in a ravine off the road, partially submerged in a river. They brought her back to the hospital and did everything they could to warm and wake her up. Owen ordered the entire time to pray for her. She eventually recovered and thanked her mentor for always bringing her back.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n\nA month later, on the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Betty was  days sober. Amelia had invited her parents, but they didn't show up. They got dressed for the wedding and took Leo and Betty with them. They arrived as the first guests because Owen had trusted his own sense of direction instead of following a faulty GPS link like the other guests. Amelia left Betty with Owen and Leo while she went to help look for Alex and Jo. While alone, Betty questioned if he and Amelia were a couple or not. Owen said they weren't and said Amelia had a tumor, which complicated things. Betty pointed out that the tumor was gone, so it was just a weird situation now instead of complicated. Owen later helped in saving the wedding planner's life when she suffered a severe allergic reaction. Afterward, the ceremony was called off and Owen joined the other guests on the ferry back to the city, where they witnessed an impromptu wedding officiated by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nThe next morning, Teddy showed up at his house. While he was sleeping, Betty answered the door and inadvertently told her about the baby, after which she made up an excuse and left. He was thus surprised to run into her at the hospital. She briefly mentioned the interim Chief position but said she was leaving. She quickly said goodbye and left, leaving Owen to wonder why she was in the city and hadn't even called him. Owen subtly threw his name in the mix for the interim Chief position by reminding Bailey he once held the job. During surgery, he saw Amelia admiring his work from the gallery. Back at home, Amelia blurted out that she had feelings for him again but that she could understand if he didn't want to go there again. She wanted him to know, as she couldn't forgive herself if her hiding her feelings made him chase after Teddy. She assured him she wouldn't stand in his way if he was still in love with Teddy. Owen says Teddy accused him of being incapable of being alone and he didn't want her to be right, but he then kissed Amelia.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nThey soon moved to the couch to make out, but Leo crying interrupted them. Owen and Amelia treated a man who got injured in a motorcycle accident without wearing a helmet. The situation made Owen think they were doing something risky themselves. Last time they tried to be together, there were no strings attached, but now they had Betty and Leo to think about. They agreed they couldn't be reckless and set up to talk it through after surgery. During their talk, he said he wanted all the strings, the kids, the fighting, and a noisy house, but he wasn't sure if she did, too. She said the tumor was gone now, but as an addict, she was still wary of change and commitment. Since she didn't want to threaten the kids' stability, she promised to try and be less wary. Having decided to go for it, they went home together holding hands.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nAs they started to spend nights together again and got used to parenting, they agreed their new life with kids worked. At work, Maggie and Owen had a shared patient and Maggie was pretty hostile towards him after a disagreement. He figured she had a problem with him and Amelia getting together again and assured her that he was all in with her, Leo, and Betty. She apologized for her behavior and left him. After a talk with Maggie, Amelia shared with Owen that Maggie's behavior had nothing to do with them.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nBetty's struggle with sobriety continued and she got into a fight with Amelia when the latter suspected she had a slip and lied about it. Owen urged them to keep it down for Leo. Amelia grounded Betty and took her to the hospital for a tox screen. Amelia struggled with disciplining a teenager as her mother never did that to her. Owen said that his mother was the opposite and Amelia called her for advice behind his back. He was confused when he spotted his mother passing through the ER. Later, Owen and Betty waited for Amelia to go home. She wondered how he could live with Amelia. He said he was honest with her and accepted her, as intense as she maybe. As Amelia arrived, Betty admitted she had gotten high on \"just weed\", Amelia scolded her and grounded her for a month. They then all left together.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nAs part of her being grounded, they dropped Betty off at school. Amelia suspected she would play hookey, so they drove around to make sure Betty wasn't ditching out the back. While waiting, Owen found out Amelia had installed apps to track Betty's location and texts. He called that obsessive and deleted them with her permission. They shared some of their own school experiences with one another. After a couple of hours, the concerned school VP sent them away when they clumsily explained their situation. They moved to a different spot and caught Betty trying to sneak out with friends. Owen whistled to alert her of their presence and she went back in. When Amelia was changing Leo, Owen wondered how their disagreement about kids could have broken up their family. She reminded him of the tumor and added that this family unit had now convinced her that nothing could erase her baby boy from her memory, something that had always plagued her when she was thinking about starting a family. After school, Betty got back in their car and commented on them camping out there all day.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy showed up at his house and this time, Owen answered the door himself. She apologized for her last visit but he said he should be apologizing instead of her for not having told her about Betty and Leo. Before she could share her news, Amelia returned to look for Betty, who had run away from school. The three of them looked for her around the city but didn't find her. They reconvened at the house and contemplated calling the police. Amelia needed a meeting so Owen took her to one while Teddy stayed at the house in case Betty showed up. When he came home with Leo, he and Teddy had a talk and he said he hadn't told her about Betty and Leo because he felt embarrassed after her accusation. He assured her that the new situation was not just him incapable of being alone as he had always wanted a kid. He told her he was happy and went to put Leo down. She then decided not to tell him about the pregnancy and left. When Amelia returned, he comforted her while she feared that Betty might be dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWhen a windstorm was heading towards the city, Teddy came to the hospital to help out. Owen asked her how long she would be staying but she replied she had no idea. Owen helped prepare the ER for all incoming patients and later got pulled onto a case with Teddy. She alerted him when she saw Betty walking around. Owen and Amelia checked out her head lac caused by a tree branch. As Amelia had to leave for surgery, Owen set up further care for her. He then joined Teddy and Jackson in the scrub room and she asked him to get coffee afterward so they could talk. In surgery, he figured she wanted to talk about the reason she had come back to and stuck around in Seattle. She wanted to wait to talk, but as soon as the patient was out of the woods, she told him that she was pregnant with his baby. He was baffled and she was paged to the ER. Jackson told him he was the last to find out about Harriet, too, but it was the best thing that happened to him.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen confronts Teddy about having kept the pregnancy secret for so long.]]\nOwen then found Teddy and got on an elevator with her and her patient. He questioned how she could have kept this from him for so long. She replied it hadn't been easy for her. Amelia then got on, too, and shared her plans to become Betty's official foster mother. She then picked up on the awkward vibe and asked what was going on. Before he could answer, the power died and they got stuck in between floors.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nThe power got back on soon, but the elevator remained stuck. Owen then told Amelia that Teddy was pregnant and she figured out the baby was his. Owen then realized Teddy had known for a while and got angry with her. The patient started crashing and they rushed to save him. While working on him, Teddy clarified she had planned to tell him the day she got here, but then she found out he had started a family already in record time. He questioned what she meant when she said nobody expected him to do anything. Teddy said the two of them getting together was off the table, so he could be with Amelia. However, she was going to stay in Seattle so the baby could have a father and she could have her friend. Owen asked her how far along he was. She told him  weeks and assured him that the baby was fine. Amelia and Teddy started arguing until the elevator doors opened and they rushed the patient to an OR. Teddy and Owen saved the man.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Amelia leaves Owen to consider all his options.]]\nAfterward, she told Owen she did want him to be involved and he said he did, too. They agreed to figure it out together and hugged to celebrate that they were having a baby. Later, Owen went to Amelia and assured her nothing would change, but she knew him and his history with Teddy and gave him time to consider all of his options. She didn't come home that night. Alone with Leo, Owen told him they would be fine.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nThe situation with Amelia made him angry at Teddy, since her keeping the secret caused him to have to choose between them. She quipped that she had upended her whole life so he could be a father. Amelia overheard him venting his anger to Teddy. She told him they were arguing like a couple, but he insisted they were not. During a quick turnover in the OR, Owen was accidentally paralyzed. Levi saved him and got him to a bed in the ICU. Teddy found out and came to sit by his side. They had an honest conversation and she told him that while she had made mistakes, too, he was the one who came to Germany and then returned to Seattle to start a family. She was thinking about moving back to Germany to her old job, but Owen had come to realize it was time for him to sacrifice something. He told her he would step down and give her his job. When he was cleared to go, he went looking for Amelia and told her truthfully that he wanted Teddy to stay here, but that he also loved his family with Amelia and that he couldn't do any of this without her. He told her he needed her and they went home together.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Owen and Teddy stood outside in the snow together as he invited her to spend Christmas with him, Amelia, and Leo, whom he was trying to create traditions with. She declined as she had to cover his shift at the ER. He promised her they would establish their own traditions with their baby. Shortly after New Year's, Owen accompanied Teddy to an ultrasound and they found out they were having a daughter. Later, Owen went to rehab with Amelia to visit Betty, who revealed her real name was Britney and that she had run away from home and her parents, who didn't know about Leo. Furious over her lie and fearful of losing Leo, Owen wanted to reach out to Britney's parents, but Amelia told him it was Betty's choice and that it was all part of the disease that is addiction. He lashed out and disagreed, stating it sounded like an excuse to justify piss poor life choices. He noticed he had offended Amelia and came around, saying he was worried over losing Leo. They hit a rough spot but he apologized with a bouquet of flowers on Valentine's Day, after which they attended the wedding of [[Natasha Deon]] and [[Garrett Boland]].<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nNot long after, Owen learned that Teddy had grown closer to Tom over the holidays. At the same time, Amelia learned that Betty had run away from rehab. He was surprised when Amelia came to tell him that Betty's parents had shown up after receiving a call from her from rehab. Amelia had explained the situation to them and they wanted to spend time with Leo, which didn't sit well with Owen. Confronted with the very real possibility of Leo being taken away, Owen dove into work and made sure a father didn't lose his son. He then decided he wouldn't let John and Carol take Leo without a court order. Powerless, they left, and Owen yelled at Amelia for revealing to them her own struggle with addiction. Amelia said she wouldn't stand in the way of him fighting for Leo and pointed out he was just a foster parent and that he had wanted Leo's mother in his life. She stated he didn't even seem to care that Betty was missing. He stated that her name was Britney and that she was never much of a mother and left.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nDespite his efforts, he had to concede to John and Carol taking their grandson home. He and Amelia said their goodbyes to Leo when they came to pick him up. Owen then quickly left for work, unable to deal with losing Leo. That day, the hospital was flooded with overdose victims, and Betty and her boyfriend were discovered among them. Owen jumped into action to save her when she deteriorated. Teddy diagnosed an aortic dissection while Owen intercepted Amelia and Betty's parents. They started arguing until Teddy came to inform them of her decision to operate on Betty herself. Owen wanted to join her, but Bailey forbade him. Owen and Amelia sat in the waiting room with John and Carol. John told Owen about the last words he said to Britney before she had run off, which were \"I can't even stand to look at you.\" Eventually, Teddy came to tell them that Betty had made it. While she took Amelia and Betty's parents to see her, Owen took care of Leo so they could focus on their daughter. He later joined them in Betty's ICU room as she woke up and was comforted by her parents.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nThe Dickinsons and Owen and Amelia worked together to take care of Leo during Betty's recovery period. When she was better, they arranged for Betty and Leo to go home with John and Carol. After the Dickinsons thanked the two of them, they left.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen learns of Tom and Teddy's relationship.]]\nOwen and Amelia needed to get out of the house and attended Catherine's party, where Owen was confronted with Teddy and Tom's new romantic relationship. He learned Tom was taking her on a surprise trip to Palm Springs, which upset Owen even more. He angrily stared at Tom the entire night and got in a fight with Amelia over his not accepting addiction as a disease. She hated how he didn't even check on how she feeling through all of this and told him it was hard to talk with him staring at Teddy the entire time. She walked away and Owen discovered Jackson and Richard weren't fond of Tom either. He went to find Amelia and clarified he was actually staring at Tom, whom he didn't want to be in his daughter's life. Amelia thought it was about his feelings for Teddy. Owen denied that and wondered how many times he had to choose Amelia over Teddy before she would believe him. Amelia then said it was an impossible situation and that she had decided to step out of it because unlike for him, there was no baby forcing her to stay in it.\n\nAs his anger amped up, Owen went to try to talk Teddy out of taking the trip, but she insisted on going and defended Tom, who joined them. Owen then started yelling at him, disrupting the celebratory speech. He thought Tom was preying on a pregnant woman and he didn't want Tom in his daughter's life, stating he was not a father. Tom then punched Owen in the face for what he said. Tom put his hand in ice to hear the rest of the speech while Owen was kept away from him, but the party was cut short when the penthouse was evacuated due to smoke originating from the kitchen. He came home and found Amelia waiting for him with the Dickinsons. They had come to realize they were too old to raise Leo and they would have their hands full with Betty, who wanted to be a teenager and didn't want to raise Leo herself either. They all agreed Owen and Amelia were Leo's true parents.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nHe and Amelia then met with a lawyer to arrange the adoption. They hit a bump when the lawyer discovered he and Amelia were no longer living together and hadn't really discussed how they would split their time with Leo. She left them to discuss it before taking the case to a judge. They settled on a -- approach, but Amelia commented that it would probably change when Owen and Teddy's baby would be born. He repeated that he chose her over Teddy and wanted her in both his and Leo's life, but Amelia insisted that her decision hurt her less than being with him did. He blamed her for not being capable of loving and being loved. Amelia then decided to withdraw her name from the adoption. While she wanted to be in Leo's life as much as she could, she acknowledged Leo had always been Owen's and that this was the best option now that the two of them were over. The judge approved the adoption and Owen signed the papers at home with Leo by his side.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nOwen struggled as a newly legal father without Amelia to help him out. At work, Owen worked on a trauma patient while Teddy worked on the man's pregnant wife. Owen offered to take over from Teddy given the woman's pregnancy, but Teddy declined. However, he insisted to sit with her by the woman's bedside to make sure she wouldn't re-bleed. She made him rub her feet and they fell asleep. Eventually, the patient started bleeding again. Owen updated the husband and then joined her in the OR. They had to perform a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding, which meant delivering the preterm fetus, who passed away in his father's arms. Owen watched over Teddy as she checked on the devastated couple in post-op and held her as she broke down in his arms.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref>\n\nOwen decided to come to Teddy's birthing class. He was surprised when he found out Tom in there, while Teddy herself hadn't shown up. She was experiencing a complication and only paged Owen, who kept it a secret from Tom and left the class. Teddy was diagnosed with cervical insufficiency, which was treated with the Trendelenburg position. [[Carina DeLuca|Carina]] asked him to make sure Teddy and the baby stayed calm, so he started talking to the baby in a baby voice, which freaked Teddy out. She expressed her fear of failing as a mother. Owen then got a gurney and lied down in Trendelenburg next to her to show her they were in this together. He told her all a parent can do is their best, admitting to several mistakes with Leo. Owen then told the baby that she wouldn't ever have to worry because her mother was so strong and fierce. Tom came in, having found out about the situation. Owen left to get coffee and Tom followed him. He blamed Owen for not informing him and warned him to rethink his decision if he was planning to make a move for Teddy, whom he had hurt and abandoned over and over, since Tom was willing to fight for her, which would bring about a lot of unnecessary pain and drama for Teddy. Tom thought Teddy deserved someone for whom she was the first and only choice. Owen then backed out and stood outside briefly while Tom fed Teddy ice cream.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile Leo started teething, Owen and Amelia kept their communication to a minimum. Owen found out Tom and Teddy were looking for houses and offered Teddy to come to live with him, but she declined. Meredith secretly arranged an abdominal wall-penis-scrotum transplant on a veteran patient of Megan Hunt's, who flew over and surprised Owen. She learned that Teddy was pregnant but dismayed upon finding out that she and Owen were not together. She found out the whole story and called Owen a dum-dum for all the stupidity he had displayed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen advocates for Caleb.]]\nWhen the transplant was canceled because the patient had lied about his support system, Owen talked about the losses he had endured in the Army himself and the shame he felt over how he reacted to them. He advised Caleb not to shut out his fianc\uee, stating people can show up for you in unbelievable ways when you let them. Owen convinced Catherine that Caleb needed the surgery to move forward and they performed it successfully. Afterward, Megan told Owen to do for himself what he had done for Caleb. She thought PTSD and war made him think he wasn't entitled to joy, which she thought was the reason behind all the hard choices he had made for himself. She made him realize he wasn't well and that he needed to work on fixing himself. He agreed to go back to therapy.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nShe recommended a therapist and called him the day of his appointment to make sure he'd go. Owen was skeptical of NET and muscle testing, but he gave it a go since it had helped Megan. Owen talked about the Germany situation and the therapist suggested his bad behavior there wasn't on accident. He thought Owen was stuck in a pattern and that they needed to find the cause in order to stop it. The muscle testing narrowed the root of the problem down Owen's own distrust. Further exploring revealed that the memory causing the pattern happened when he was . He had won a science award at school and ran home with the certificate to show his mother, but before he could do so, she told him that his father had died. He then hid the certificate and felt so ashamed for being so proud and happy while his mother was so sad. The therapist told Owen that the memory caused him not to trust joy, fearing it would always be followed by bad news. He put Owen in a specific position, allowing him to let go of that distrust. After weeping in his therapist's arms for finally letting himself experience joy again, Owen went home. Teddy checked in on him through a text and he told her about the session.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nBack at work, Owen learned that Amelia and Link had grown closer and that Teddy was still house hunting while Tom had started to plan the delivery, including a playlist. Amelia came in to clear Owen's patient's brain scans and he asked her about Link, but she told him it was none of his business. He found her later and told her that therapy had made him realize that he was actually the one who was incapable of love. She thanked him for saying that and he invited her to spend more time with Leo, who was missing her. Afterward, Owen returned to his therapist and told him the first session had worked. He had realized that he loved Teddy and he wasn't feeling guilty about it anymore. He asked for more sessions so he would feel perfectly clear when he would tell Teddy.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nOwen went to the airport to help [[Frances Pinfield]], a severely agoraphobic blood donor for [[Gus Carter]], get off her plane and to the hospital. It took a FaceTime conversation with Gus's mother and Owen carrying her to the limo to do so. While en route to the hospital, thick fog started to cover part of the city and the limo got in the middle of a pile-up on the freeway.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen supports Teddy through the delivery.]]\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Teddy hold their baby girl Allison.]]\nEveryone made it out fine and Owen arranged an ambulance as a ride to the hospital. He helped out with the patient in the rig. The ambulance arrived together with the police car that transported a laboring Teddy and Amelia. He accompanied Teddy to the delivery room and apologized for hiding his fling with Carina, her OB, which she had found out about through Amelia. Teddy forbade Owen from watching what was going on between her legs. With the head halfway out, Teddy needed to be distracted while waiting for the next push. Owen then told her he was in love with her and had always been. He hadn't understood he was allowed to be happy and he had been afraid of the way he felt around her because it felt so good, so he sabotaged it before life could do it for him. He told her he wanted to spend the rest of his life proving to her that he was worthy of her love. She then gave the final push and their daughter was born. They simultaneously decided to name her Allison. Owen stayed by Teddy's side and they spent time together with their baby daughter.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nAmelia dropped by with Leo so he could meet his sister. Bailey then came in to fetch him and Amelia for trauma since she had to fire three attendings and Andrew was in jail. A week later, Teddy had returned to her hotel room. Owen found her and Allison both crying when he dropped by with supplies. He offered to come home with him, but she refused to start their life together in that house. He took Allison from her so she could go shower. He tried to help out as much as he could, but in his eager efforts to help out, he bluntly offered to milk Teddy when she had clogged duct and heat pads weren't helping. She was offended and shut him out. She developed the habit to bring Allison to the hospital when she started panicking, so he went to look for her there. He told Amelia what had happened and she told him that giving birth was a beast to a woman's body, so he would need to be patient with Teddy. After weeks of tiptoeing around Teddy, he visited her again in her hotel room and told her he had listed his house and had hired a realtor to find them a new one, already having hundreds of listings for them to go through. In the meanwhile, he had upgraded them to the suite. He also demanded that she'd let him help out as it was too much for her on her own. She got up and thanked him with a kiss.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Tom taunted Owen for his leaving Teddy in a hotel. Owen suggested he go back to his job in Baltimore, after which Tom revealed to him his new position at the Foundation, which made him Owen's boss. While working to resuscitate [[Reid Kim]], Owen accidentally shocked Tom in the crotch with the defibrillators. He quickly apologized to Tom while rushing Reid to the OR. Later, he stopped by Tom's room to properly apologize and found out that Tom had obtained an emergency restraining order against him for acute physical and emotional distress. Owen objected that they worked together but Tom just asked him to leave.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nTom used the restraining order to show his dominance over Owen by having kicked out of his own trauma room and the ER. He found Teddy struggling to change Allison on a bench outside and took over for her. Afterward, he suggested they take a tour of the hospital to humor Teddy. He showed her scans of his patients and she eagerly pitched a solution, making him realize how much she missed work. They moved to the OR gallery to avoid Tom and he suggested he stay home with Allison for a while so she could go back to work. She refused because she didn't like admitting she was failing as a mother. He said he didn't like work having to avoid Tom and pointed out returning to work would make her happy again, which in turn would make her a better mother. She then happily accepted and left to get changed to start working.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAfter dropping off Leo at daycare, Owen ran into Bailey in the ambulance and he informed her of his paternity leave because of Koracick's restraining order. An ambulance arrived with [[Yan Huang]], who refused to be treated at Grey Sloan because of Meredith's recent negative article. Owen then jumped onto the rig to provide care while Yan was transported to Pac-North. Upon arrival, he was confronted with an incompetent resident in the ER and he decided to deliver the patient straight to the OR. He handed the patient off to Richard and ran into Alex, who invited him for a tour after learning of his leave. Alex talked about the investors' big checks and his plans for the future. During the tour, they answered a woman's call for help from the ICU as another incompetent resident was failing to stop her husband's post-op hemorrhage. Owen and Alex jumped in and Owen learned just how bad the residents were. During surgery, Owen talked about his leaving Grey Sloan and Alex offered him the job of Head of Trauma, allowing him to structure the department as he saw fit. Owen accepted the position because he liked the chaos, which reminded him of the Army. Afterward, he went to pick up Teddy and Leo at Grey Sloan, where they ran into Tom, who had come to realize they needed good doctors and had gotten rid of the restraining order so Owen could come back. Owen replied he had quit and taken another job at Pac-North, surprising both Tom and Teddy.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Owen dropped off a box of his old handmade Halloween costumes for Teddy at Grey Sloan. At work, several patients in the ICU started crashing while the discovery of a mass grave sent rumors of the place being haunted around the hospital. He and Alex set out to investigate and discovered that a faulty fridge in the ICU's own blood supply had caused the blood to hemolyze. In the evening, he met up with Teddy for the Halloween parade on the peds floor. Teddy told him she wouldn't be making costumes for their children like his mother had. He knew that and didn't expect her to, which is why he brought over the box to see if any of the costumes fit Leo or Allison. He understood Teddy had assumed he had tried to shame her. She admitted it had inspired her and revealed she had dressed up their children as zombies, which he thought was inappropriate for kids.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nOne day, Teddy dropped Owen off at work and he wanted to take a picture of Allison, but his phone storage was full. Amelia visited him, supposedly to return one of Leo's favorite toys, but she actually blurted out that she was pregnant with Link's baby. As she told him that she wanted Leo in the baby's life, paramedics brought in Cassidy Gardner, who had fallen down the stairs and was found by her young son. An ultrasound revealed that Cassidy was pregnant. She already knew and was disappointed that she was still pregnant after the fall. She said she couldn't have another baby. Owen went to tell Amelia since Cassidy wouldn't elaborate.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Owen and Amelia disagree over Cassidy's wanting an abortion.]]\nTogether, they went in to tell her that the necessary splenectomy could endanger the fetus. Cassidy didn't want another child. Owen bluntly asked if she had thrown herself down those stairs to terminate the pregnancy. She swore she hadn't. She had tried to get help in a clinic with financial assistance but something always fell through so she made a tea she had found online, which made her dizzy and caused her to fall. She swore she would never do something to hurt herself or her son. Amelia offered to get someone for the abortion so it could be performed during Owen's surgery but Owen interjected that he'd rather deal with the surgery first and the pregnancy afterward. Outside the room, Owen scolded Amelia for overstepping and shut her down when she tried to make her case, after which he dismissed her. Owen performed the surgery and found Amelia and OB nurse in Cassidy's room when he came for a post-op exam. He was mad at Amelia for going behind his back but she stated she was only providing the help that he wouldn't give Cassidy. She suspected it had something to do with her own pregnancy. Owen threw in her face that they got divorced over Amelia not wanting kids and now she was having kids with someone else. She left. He chased her and apologized. She also apologized. She should have known that this was going to be a bigger conversation than she had anticipated. She told him that she really didn't want kids when they were married. Something changed in her and Betty and Leo were a big part of that. She wasn't ready before but she was now, and she had him to thank for that. She said they would always be family through Leo, which they both liked. He asked how they were going to handle this whole family thing. She admitted it was a complicated situation. He realized he had to go apologize to Cassidy for projecting his anger on her.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nOwen and Teddy showed up for Meredith's hearing before the medical commission while arguing about sleep training Allison. Owen testified to Meredith's outstanding surgical skills. He specifically cited Megan's case, though his testimony was weakened when the prosecution brought up Bailey's post-op notes from Megan's first surgery, which detailed Owen's serious doubts about Meredith's approach at the time. Later, Owen let in the group of patients who had come to testify on Meredith's behalf. After the hearing was over, he congratulated Meredith when it was announced she got to keep her license.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nWith Alex taking some personal time, Owen acted as interim Chief. He showed around [[Daphne Lopez]], an emergency medicine attending who was looking for a job in Seattle. She was also interested in Seattle Pres but Owen impressed her throughout the day. As she walked off, Richard commented on his trying to impress Daphne, warning that that was a slippery slope. Owen said he was happy together with Teddy. Richard asked if he had proposed yet. When Owen said he hadn't, Richard asked what he was waiting for.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nOwen and Richard came to Grey Sloan to help out after Meredith let them know a car had crashed into Joe's bar, injuring several of their residents. Owen worked with Tom and Jackson on [[Blake Simms]], who had a facial fracture. On his way to the OR, he complained to Teddy and Amelia about Tom being an ass to him once again. Teddy asked him to cut Tom some slack. While Jackson and Owen were operating, Tom came in to demand hourly updates. After he was gone, [[Hannah Brody]] commented Teddy could do so much better than that guy. Jackson pointed out Teddy was with Owen. Hannah blamed her mistake on the way Tom talks to Teddy. Jackson then asked Owen if he and Teddy had set a wedding date yet. Owen said he hadn't even proposed yet. After sending Hannah out to do an intake in the ER, Owen told Jackson that he was feeling a lot of pressure for the right proposal as it had to make up for the fact that he hadn't done it decades ago. Jackson pointed out wanting to be with her forever included the present. Just as Tom came in to check for an update, Owen caught a subtle sign of a CSF leak, which Tom fixed. After surgery, Jackson and Owen updated Blake's grandmother, who informed him that Tom had paid for her to move to Seattle with Blake because he wanted Blake so badly. Tom came over and thanked Owen for catching the leak. They shook hands. Afterward, Owen took Teddy to an on-call room and got down on one knee with his mother's ring, which she had given him the day Allison was born. He told her there was no perfect moment but he knew she was the perfect woman for him. She checked if he was proposing out of obligation, citing his pattern of feeling trapped by obligations and his fear of disappointing others. He told her he was starting a new pattern of loving her and their family. He then asked her to marry him. She accepted. They headed out and announced their engagement to their colleagues, with Tom watching the happy couple from a distance.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nOwen showed up at Grey Sloan to take Teddy to a surprise lunch to talk wedding plans. She confessed she had lost his mother's ring. They set out to find it, even checking the pipes in the sink. They got a call that Leo was vomiting in daycare and found out on his scan that he had swallowed the ring. As they waited for him to pass it, Teddy expressed guilt over having lost it. He suggested she wear a necklace with letters for each member of the family instead of the ring and keep that hidden away for special occasions.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nThe next Monday, Owen arrived at work late and was told by Richard that Catherine had purchased Pac-North to shut it down after a fight with him. She had all personnel go to Grey Sloan to interview with Tom to keep their jobs. Tom kept Owen waiting. When Tom was done with the attendings and called in a second-year resident, Owen protested but Tom assured him he would be out in time for his wedding. At the end of the day, Tom did an elaborate phone call with Catherine while Owen was the only one still waiting. Amelia sat with Owen and reminded him that he stole Tom's girlfriend. She pointed out Owen got everything, a family included, leaving Tom lonely and in pain, so he should let Tom have this. Owen was in awe of her empathy. Later, he teamed up with the board members and they presented Tom with an ultimatum, which included hiring Owen and Richard back, threatening to quit if he didn't comply with their wishes. Tom was forced to agree.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Owen and Jo were operating together, she asked him what he would do if he were to find out Amelia's baby was his. She stressed it was just hypothetical but Alex ignoring her texts was making her consider worst case scenarios. Owen replied that it took him a long time to get to this place with Teddy and he wouldn't let anything screw that up. Later, Owen ended up on an elevator with Link and asked him how he was holding up with Amelia half-way through the pregnancy. He had noticed Amelia had missed some days at work. Holding back that the baby actually might be his, Link simply stated things were complicated but that the baby was healthy. Owen recalled feeling useless when Teddy was pregnant. He advised Link to listen and sympathize and keep trying to help even if he wasn't sure how.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nWhen a blizzard hit Seattle, Owen and Teddy left their kids with his mother so they could both help out in the busy ER. He managed to help save a pregnant woman and her baby. Unaware of Teddy having found out that Amelia's baby might be his, he sent her a text asking to go sledding as he headed home.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOwen eagerly started planning the wedding while Teddy's recent discovery left her less enthusiastic. Blissfully unaware, he forwarded Teddy a list of venues that his mother had compiled but Teddy suggested just getting a wedding planner, which he didn't want to. He asked her to look at the list, which might help her figure out what she wanted. Later, he ran into her and asked what was going on when she ignore him. She blurted out Amelia's baby could be his and asked what that meant for him. He didn't answer, which upset her. Owen took some time process the news. He made Teddy dinner and told her he had just been shocked by the news. He assured her she was not a replacement for anyone. He added that whatever happened, his answer would always be that he loved her and that they would figure out.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, Amelia found Owen and Teddy in a lounge and announced to them that Link was in fact the father of her baby. Owen was happy to hear that as they could all move forward now. Owen took part in Meredith's [[Pro Bono Surgery Day|pro bono surgery day]]. He turned down Jackson's invitation to come to the game with him. As he scrubbed in with Jo, he wanted to say he was sorry about Alex having left her. He invited her to come over if she ever felt like she needed company. At the end of the day, Owen found Teddy crying on a bench outside. He comforted her and asked what was going on. Instead of telling about her having slept with Tom, she told him about a rough case.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Richard had a public meltdown, Teddy had a busy day having taken over Maggie's cases, causing her to forget about her and Owen's appointment to try out wedding cakes. As Owen and Link operated together, Link admitted he was nervous about becoming a dad. Owen truthfully told him that parenthood was scary and that those worries wouldn't go away. At the end of the day, Owen took Teddy into a supply closet, where they started to make out. She told him she wanted to get married that weekend.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nThe morning of the wedding, Owen got into an argument with Tom as he had ignored his request for time off. Tom had only seen the subject line and had indeed ignored it as he thought the wedding was still months away, so he didn't think it was urgent. Owen then informed him the wedding was happening tonight, surprising Tom, who approved the time off. Owen headed into surgery with Maggie, where they received the news about Richard's cobalt poisoning. As the surgery neared its end, Owen received a voice mail from Teddy. He had Levi play it on speaker. It was Teddy moaning. Owen brushed it off as a wedding present meant for him. However, after surgery, he retreated to a supply closet and listened to the entire message, which revealed that Teddy was having sex with him. He heard how she told Tom that this was goodbye sex and that she was still marrying Owen. However, Owen called his mother and claimed he got pulled into an emergency surgery, calling off the wedding. He left Teddy in the dark, leaving her to find out from his mother after having gotten all dressed up.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\nFarouk, Megan's son, ended up needing a heart transplant. When a heart became available, Owen, Teddy, and Cormac went to retrieve it. After their driver had a heart attack, they ended up dangling off a cliff. Desperate to save Farouk, Teddy climbed out with the heart and went to flag down a passing vehicle. After some time, Owen told Cormac to climb out so his sons wouldn't lose their father after already losing their mother. He also told Cormac that he'd promised Noah he'd help other soldiers end their suffering as he'd done with Noah. He made Cormac promise to do that for him. Once Cormac had climbed out, the car slid off the cliff with Owen and the driver still inside.<ref>[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]], x</ref>\n\n\nOwen was changed profoundly by his experiences in Iraq. When confronted by his former fianc\uee [[Beth Whitman]] after returning, she told him he didn't even look like himself anymore. She thought he looked hard.\n\nOwen was shown to be humble when he started working at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, known at the time as Seattle Grace Hospital. Owen's treatment of his patients was flawed due to the fact he was used to treating patients in a war zone, but not a civilian hospital. Derek and Mark originally planned to reprimand him for his subpar treatment, but when Owen openly acknowledged his shortcomings and asked Derek and Mark for feedback so he could improve as a civilian doctor, they abandoned their plan and opted instead to teach Owen so he could improve as a civilian doctor.\n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\n[[File:Crowenkiss.jpg|thumb|left|px|Cristina and Owen kiss.]] Owen managed to impress Cristina as soon as they met, having performed an emergency tracheotomy in the field with a pen, and later closing up the gash in his leg with a staple gun without any kind of anesthesia. Later the same night, Owen found Cristina lying outside the hospital, having been impaled through the abdomen by a falling icicle. He carried her inside and treated her, eventually removing the icicle, and the two bonded. After Owen had taken care of Cristina, Dr. Webber offered him a job, but Owen turned down the offer as he was expected to return to Iraq. He left the hospital that night, but not before surprising Cristina with a passionate kiss that left her completely taken aback.\n\nOwen returned to Seattle two months later, having been honorably discharged from the army, and took a job as the new [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Trauma Surgery at Seattle Grace. Cristina first avoided him, but after he had forgotten her name, calling her \"Christine\", she confronted him. Owen then told her about his platoon's demise and explained that while he remembered her name, that belonged to the past, and he was now living in the present. Owen then kept his distance to Cristina and tried to act professionally towards her, but couldn't hide his jealousy as Mark Sloan was constantly trying to hit on her, or his anger when he heard Sloan call her \"bad, cheap wine.\" Owen himself compared her to a single malt scotch. \n\nWhen Owen questioned Cristina's motives for doing surgery, she opened up to him and told him the story of her father's death, which encouraged Owen to start moving closer. However, after a patient who became special to Owen died, he found himself arguing with her outside Joe's and then kissing her passionately, almost violently. This caused the two to avoid each other again until Owen showed up outside her house on the doorstep and told her that he thought she was beautiful. A little later, Cristina was upset for not getting the solo surgery, so Owen took her to the vent in the boiler room of the hospital, which cheered her up and the two kissed.\n\nAs Owen's moods continued to swing, Cristina snapped at him and told him to stop his hot and cold act. Owen responded by asking her out, but in the evening he was so nervous that he went to get a drink, ultimately showing up on her doorstep hours late and drunk. Cristina was angry at first, but after Owen, who was standing in her shower fully clothed and shoes on, told her about his best and worst surgery ever, she softened and went into the shower with him. Owen then passed out and woke up the next morning, naked in Cristina's bed. At the hospital, he apologized to Cristina, telling her he normally doesn't pass out naked in other people's beds, but she plays it off and leaves. Later that day, he confronts her, asking her to give him another chance, which she did. \n\nAfter this, their relationship was mostly centered around stolen touches and glances from across the room and although they flirted, it stopped when Owen's secret ex-fianc\uee Beth appeared at Seattle Grace, where her father was admitted. This caused Owen to have a panic attack and Cristina calmed him down, which resulted in Owen falling asleep on top of her in an on-call room and Cristina smiling happily as she held him in her arms. Though Cristina was wary at first after learning of Beth's identity, she and Owen moved on and he soon confessed that he wanted to be around her for the rest of his life.\n\nCristina and Owen started spending nights together - though they still hadn't had sex - but were soon confronted by new problems: Owen's PTSD from his time in Iraq started to manifest itself as violent nightmares and hypnagogic hallucinations. Ultimately, one night Owen fell asleep next to Cristina in her bed, and the spinning blades of the ceiling fan above the bed reminded him of helicopter blades, which caused him to have a hallucination and strangle Cristina in the middle of a nightmare. Cristina was rescued by Callie, who was alarmed by the noise coming from the bedroom, and Owen woke up, having no idea what was going on. He then broke down crying and apologized profusely, and Cristina - despite Meredith and Callie's resistance - forgave him, saying his PTSD is a war wound and not his fault. Soon after this, they made love for the first time in an on-call room, but Cristina realized that she's afraid to fall asleep in his arms, and broke up with him. After this, Owen started to see Dr. Wyatt, who helped him express and name his emotions and recognize the triggers to his PTSD (such as the blades of the ceiling fan). As Owen was further torn apart by his feelings for Cristina which he couldn't express because he thought it would be cruel to do so, Dr. Wyatt taught him to use three-word sentences as substitutes to the three words he wanted to say the most (I love you). As Owen continued to avoid her and only spoke to her with brief three-word sentences, Cristina became more and more confused and annoyed. When she finally confronted him in front of the hospital, he gave her a list of the sentences he used and explained what the speaking in three-word sentences meant and told her that he was trying to make things right by letting her go. Cristina then told him to \"take care now\", one of the three-word sentences meaning \"I love you\" he used for her multiple times, and left.  \n\nAs his therapy progressed, Owen started to move closer to Cristina, but she seemed to withdraw, asking him about finally going to visit his mother and telling her that he was back from Iraq. This caused Owen to ponder things and he came to the conclusion that at heart, his problems were caused by his unfinished business in Iraq. He then told Cristina that he was returning to the army, but she gave no support to the idea, later telling him: \"I don't want you to die.\" She then convinced him to abandon the idea of returning to the army and go visit his mother with her instead. After seeing his mother, Owen was able to sleep without nightmares, and with the violent dreams now gone, he and Cristina decided to get back together.\n\nLater, Cristina was missing a cardio attending to teach her, so Owen brought over his fellow army surgeon, [[Teddy Altman|Dr. Teddy Altman]], as a gift for Cristina. Teddy began to mentor Cristina, and, after a rough start, the two got along well. As it turned out, however, Teddy's presence caused a lot of trouble for Cristina and Owen, as she and Owen had had feelings for each other in the army without the other knowing. After this matter was revealed, Cristina was willing to stand aside, but Owen assured her that he only wanted her. This caused Teddy to think about leaving the hospital, and Cristina, whose workaholic nature had been awoken by the motivation of working with Teddy, offered her an exchange in a panic: if Teddy stayed, she could have Owen. Teddy then told Owen about the offer and he confronted Cristina, telling her that their relationship matters and she doesn't get to toss him aside like that. Cristina, however, remained uncertain and eventually broke up with him, telling him that until he had made his choice, the two of them had no business together.\n\nThe triangle between Owen, Cristina, and Teddy wasn't settled until the hospital was invaded by the murderous gunman [[Gary Clark]]. Owen and Teddy made it out of the hospital with a patient, but after realizing that Cristina was still inside, Owen made his decision and ran back to the hospital to find her. He then found Cristina in an OR where she was operating on Derek, who had been shot earlier, with Jackson, Meredith, and April - and with Gary Clark holding his gun against her head, ordering her to stop operating. Owen then tried to distract the gunman from Cristina, even yelling at him as he was about to shoot her: \"That is the woman that I love. You shoot her, you touch her, and I will kill you!\" The situation became even more dangerous when Meredith stood up, ordering the gunman to kill her instead of Derek. As the barrel of the gun moved to Meredith, Owen jumped towards Clark, forcing the shooter to shoot him instead of Meredith. After the gunman had gone, Cristina, not knowing the extent of his injuries, urged Meredith to save Owen. Luckily, it turned out the bullet had only pierced his shoulder, and in the wake of the disaster, Owen and Cristina got back together. \n\nAfter the shooting, Cristina suffered from PTSD and Owen took care of her, eventually proposing to her. Not long after, they got married in front of all their friends in a ceremony held at Meredith's and moved in together, purchasing an old firehouse that they decorated. Cristina later found out that she was pregnant with their child. Owen was thrilled, but Cristina, not wanting to become a mother, told him that she was going to have an abortion. Owen tried unsuccessfully to talk her out of it and ultimately kicked her out of their home for failing to give him a voice in the matter. However, Cristina found herself unable to go through with the abortion without Owen's support, which alarmed Meredith, who, after telling him what sort of miserable future would await both Cristina and the child if she kept it, convinced Owen to let Cristina have the abortion. Owen held Cristina's hand during the procedure, but the moment seemed bittersweet and involuntary. \n\nIt soon became clear that Owen was not okay with it. He and Cristina grew apart, he became more and more distant and silent, until the situation finally exploded during Zola's birthday party. Owen and Cristina got into a huge argument in front of all of their friends, which ended with Owen accusing Cristina of killing their baby. After this, the situation only grew worse, and during a session with a marriage counselor, it became clear that they both failed to understand each other's point of view on the baby issue.\n\nOwen's discomfort and anxiety eventually led him to get drunk and having a one night stand with a patient's friend. He confessed his infidelity to Cristina, who had earlier suspected him of having an affair with nurse Emily Kovach, which completely devastated her. Owen moved out of the firehouse and Cristina started to plan to move to Minnesota and accept the fellowship offered at Mayo Clinic. However, before leaving, she slept with Owen one last time, forgiving his infidelity. \n\nAfter Cristina and the others had been rescued from the forest in the wake of the plane crash, Owen promised to take care of Cristina, who was in a psychosis. He took her to the firehouse and managed to get her to speak. After she had fully recovered, she left for Minnesota to pursue her fellowship, while Owen stayed back in Seattle to continue his role as [[Chief of Surgery]]. After Cristina's mentor, Dr. Thomas died, she returned to Seattle and tried to make efforts to reconcile with Owen. Due to a lawsuit against the plane company, Owen asked Cristina for a divorce, which would help the surgeons with their trial. Cristina then told Owen she wanted to try again and he agreed, but they still went through with the divorce for the sake of the lawsuit. Their newfound happiness was short-lived, however, as the arrival of -year-old [[Ethan Dawson]], with whom Owen bonded, made it very clear that Owen still wanted children. Cristina then realized that she would never be able to give Owen what he desires, so she left him during the superstorm that hit Seattle. \n\nAfter the storm, Owen and Cristina faced the tough challenge of staying apart, and even though they ended up having sex - more than once - Cristina was determined to stick to her decision. Upon realizing that they could never detach themselves from one another as long as they let things stay the way they were, Cristina suggested that they'd start seeing other people in order to let go of each other, and Owen reluctantly agreed. Later, during GSMH's fundraiser gala, Owen met [[Emma Marling|Dr. Emma Marling]], with whom he started flirting. Cristina, witnessing the situation, left the scene with a downhearted expression on her face, leaving Owen with the other woman. Emma and Owen's relationship becomes quite serious and they even consider moving in together. However, after another emotional encounter with Cristina, Owen breaks up with Emma realizing that he wants to have a future with a woman who shares an equal passion for surgery as she does for children. After he breaks up with Emma, Cristina tries to help him find someone else.\n\nCristina and Owen continued a deep friendship with each other until Cristina left for Switzerland.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nFollowing Cristina's departure, Owen focused on his work and was skeptical about getting back to the dating game, despite him and Callie constantly encouraging each other to do so. However, he soon began to bond with Amelia, of whom he felt protective after a distraught patient revealed her past drug-addiction to the entire hospital, upsetting and humiliating her. When Jackson and April's baby died, he held her hand as she opened up to him about her own deceased baby, and the two developed feelings for each other.\n\nHaving been out of the dating game for so long, Owen was hesitant about making a move on her. He was constantly cautious and nervous around her, stammering his way through discussions with her. It wasn't until Amelia - just as helpless as him - came to visit him with a bottle of water that he finally took action and kissed her. A little later, after some failed attempts, they slept together for the first time.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Amelia tells Owen to consider his options.]]\n\nProblems soon arose, however, as Amelia began to fear that mixing professional and personal lives together would eventually result in a disaster. After a risky procedure to which Owen had given his consent went wrong, Amelia freaked out, believing that he only sided with her because of his personal feelings, and ended the relationship. The two then spent the following year apart, due to Owen going on another tour in Iraq after Derek's death. He returned to find Amelia, to whom he had had to break the news of her brother's demise a year before, completely shut down, refusing to deal with her grief. Upon learning that she was on the verge of relapsing again, he helped her open up and deal with her emotions.\n\nThe two continued to grow very close, to the point where Amelia decided to propose to Owen, telling him that despite the fact that marriage may be too soon, she was sure that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.<ref>[[At Last]], x</ref> They got married immediately after getting engaged in front of their friends and family.\n\nOwen and Amelia's wedding bliss didn't last for long as they realized they had a difference in opinion about starting a family. Amelia felt that Owen was pressuring her to start a family, which she wasn't ready for. Their marital problems got so bad that Amelia didn't come home for weeks and avoided Owen at the hospital. After months of their marriage being on the rocks, Owen had enough and went to ask for a divorce from Amelia. Just as he was about to do so, he discovered that she had a brain tumor, which likely affected her judgment about their hasty marriage. Once the tumor was removed, Owen and Amelia amicably decided to get a divorce, as they didn't know which part of their relationship was not affected by her tumor, which had been growing for approximately ten years.\n\nAfter getting divorced, Owen spent some time away from Amelia and decided to foster a baby named Leo. However, he soon realized he was in over his head and sought help from Amelia, who later moved in to help him and also mentor Leo's birth mother, Betty, who was addicted to drugs. Owen and Amelia bonded over their new family. Eventually, Amelia told Owen she still had feelings for him, and they got back together. Their relationship seemed to be back on track until Teddy returned to Seattle and revealed that she was pregnant with Owen's baby. Amelia gave Owen time to consider his options, and he chose Amelia. However, after Betty and Leo went back with Betty's parents, Owen and Amelia started fighting again, leading to another breakup.\n\n[[Teddy Altman]]\nOwen and Teddy met while they both were army surgeons. Both developed hidden feelings for one another. Owen brought her to Seattle Grace-Mercy West as a present for [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], claiming her to be the \"cardio goddess\", and Teddy later works out that Owen brought her as a present for his girlfriend, appearing more surprised by the fact Cristina was his girlfriend. She later would admit that she believed that if Owen broke up with his (ex) fianc\uee, Beth, he would have called her. Upon finding out, Owen became conflicted and almost kissed Teddy in a closet, but realized that he loved Cristina. The two remained good friends even after Teddy left Seattle to work in Germany.\n\nUpon Megan Hunt's discovery, Teddy returned to Seattle to see Owen and support him.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref> While in Seattle, she, along with Megan and Evelyn, confronted him about his failing marriage. After a fight with Amelia, Owen kissed Teddy, but she backed away, not wanting to ruin their friendship. She then returned to Germany.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Owen and Amelia's marriage ended, they continued sleeping together. After one hook-up, Amelia told Owen to seek out Teddy, claiming that he was still thinking about her. Owen did what she told him to, arriving at Teddy's doorstep in Germany and declaring his love for her. After spending the day together, however, Owen ended up slipping that it was Amelia who told him to come. Upon hearing this, Teddy was angry and hurt, claiming that he had once again fooled her into thinking that they could actually be together. The two got into a fight that ended with Teddy kicking him out, refusing to speak to him anymore.<ref>[[One Day Like This]], x</ref> When Teddy found out she'd become pregnant during this tryst, she returned to Seattle to tell Owen.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref> She eventually told Owen she was pregnant during the wind storm, and they got along during her pregnancy even though they were both in relationships. Right before Teddy went into labor, she realized she loved Owen, while Owen realized he loved Teddy after several sessions of therapy. He told her he loved her just as she gave birth to their daughter, [[Allison Hunt|Allison]].<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nLater on, during a surgery, Jackson asks Owen if he's set a date yet, which he responds to by saying he and Teddy aren't engaged. Jackson is surprised by this, and Owen says he wants to marry her, but he's afraid the proposal won't be big enough to make up for the fact that he didn't do it years, even decades ago. Jackson warns him not to wait too long. Teddy also tells Amelia that PTSD is about patterns and that Owen has a history of fear of obligation, while Teddy \"showed up with a belly full of obligation.\" Amelia responds by saying he loves Teddy. Teddy says that Owen hasn't proposed yet, but Amelia says that if he felt trapped, he would've already proposed. Owen meets Teddy in a room and proposes to her with his mom's ring. Teddy begins crying, and she tells him that she doesn't want him to feel obligated to marry her. She wants him to break his patterns, not reinforce them. Owen replies by saying he's starting a new pattern of loving her. When they leave the room, they publicly announce their engagement, which is received with congratulations from both Link and Amelia.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nTeddy confessed to him that Amelia's baby might be his, expressing concern over what their relationship would be if it was his. Owen said nothing, which caused Teddy to walk away. Later that night, Owen cooked for Teddy and told her that his answer would always be that he loved her.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nOn their wedding day, Owen found out that Teddy had been cheating on him with Tom through an accidental voicemail. He called off the wedding with the excuse that he had a last-minute surgery.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n[[Beth Whitman]]\nOwen was engaged to a woman named Beth, but in the army, he broke it off in a two-line email. She was always too emotional and attached to everything & everyone for him to handle. When he visited Seattle Grace, he kissed Cristina but left (though he was single at the time).\n\n[[Emma Marling]]\nOwen met Emma during GSMH's fundraiser gala and began flirting with her after seeing Cristina flirt with another possible donor. During the evening, he found out that she is actually an [[attending]] [[Maternal-Fetal Medicine|perinatologist]] from [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital|Seattle Pres]] trying to gain some money for her hospital by taking advantage of GSMH's gala, but he didn't seem to mind. At the end of the evening, she came to see Owen at the hospital.\n\nOwen and Emma kept in touch after the evening, and she even baked him banana bread for work, which caused Callie to begin teasing him by calling Emma his girlfriend. At first, Owen denied being in a relationship with her, but after it became clear to all that the two had something going on, he admitted dating her to a couple people. He didn't tell Emma about his history with Cristina, and she later found out about their past from her while visiting the hospital. Emma then realized that Owen wasn't ready to date just yet and said goodbye to him, telling him to call her when he's ready to move on. After talking with Callie and April and receiving some advice from Cristina, Owen eventually called her and told her he was ready to move on. They continued dating, and later Emma was offered a job at GSMH. Though Owen was excited about the idea, Emma turned down the offer, not wanting to work at the same hospital with Owen in case something bad were to happen between them.\n\nAs their relationship became more serious, Owen and Emma discussed getting a place together and the possibility of marriage. Emma told Owen of her plans to become a stay-at-home mom and raise her children. However, later that same day, Cristina came to the trailer drunk and she and Owen slept together. Owen broke up with Emma the next day, saying they wanted different things, but leaving out that he had cheated on her. Emma was devastated.\n\n\n[[Evelyn Hunt]]\nEvelyn is Owen's mother, with whom he has a close relationship. After returning from Iraq as a changed man, he initially refused to see his mother, instead of calling her once a week as if he were still in Iraq. The reason for this was that he feared that she would look at him like a ghost, as he was no longer the son she sent to war. Cristina, however, finally convinced him to meet her, and in the end, Evelyn still loved him as before.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\nOwen is also fiercely protective of his mother, as proven when he learned that she was dating a man young enough to be his brother.<ref>[[With or Without You]], x</ref> He also told Nathan Riggs to stay away from her, even punching him when he claimed that she was his family as well.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\n[[Megan Hunt]]\nMegan is Owen's sister, whose existence none of his co-workers and friends knew of until his feud with Nathan became apparent. He barely speaks of her but has revealed to Amelia that she was three years younger than him, smarter, funnier, and a better person than him. The two were apparently very close, as Megan was described as doing everything her older brother did, even following in his footsteps to med school.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\n[[Nathan Riggs]]\nOwen and his sister met Nathan in med school, where the two men became the best of friends, almost brothers to each other. This also led to Nathan becoming romantically involved with Megan, enough to make him think of the Hunts as his family. He and Owen had a falling out, however, caused by Owen blaming Nathan for allowing Megan on a helicopter that disappeared, and hadn't seen each other for years until Nathan began to work at Grey Sloan Memorial. Whatever the specific connection and circumstances, Owen hates him with a fiery passion, enough to interfere with his work.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Megan is found alive and brought back to the United States, she confesses her brother the truth about her accident and how she was the first to cheat on Nathan, even scolding Owen when he expresses his disbelief about her willingness to forgive Nathan while he himself has cheated on Cristina. Owen, by this, understands how he wrongly hated his friend and how much, on the other hand, Nathan was a good friend by letting himself be hated without ever telling about Megan's faults. Owen has never objected the relationship between Megan and Nathan again.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], x</ref>\n\n[[Leo Hunt]]\nLeo is Owen's foster son, whom he received soon after filing for foster-to-adopt. At first, he was very uncertain about having made the right decision, doubting his skills as a parent and fearing that he had forced it to happen. After some encouraging words from Amelia and Alex, however, he regained his confidence and began to get used to his new role as a parent.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nOwen and Derek were at odds as soon as they met: Derek was telling the wife of one of the men Owen had rescued from the limousine accident that her husband would never walk again, when Owen walks in, trashes Derek's prognosis and suggests therapeutic hypothermia, which could possibly make the man walk again. Derek wasn't too happy about the new guy's interference, so when Owen was given a job at Seattle Grace, Derek was very dubious about his new colleague. The two eventually bonded, however, as Derek gave Owen advice on how to deal with the unique relationship between Meredith and Cristina, and eventually, Derek, Owen, and Mark became friends. Owen even asked Derek to be his best man at his wedding. Derek was honored, but couldn't make it to the wedding because he spent the night in jail after speeding, but Owen didn't seem to mind that he wasn't able to attend the ceremony.\n\nAfter the plane crash and the death of [[Mark Sloan]], Derek held a grudge against Owen, as he blamed him for putting them on a poor plane that crashed. Cristina urged Derek to forgive him, but he was unable to do so, which eventually lead to Owen quitting. It was only after Cristina's interference that Derek realized the source of his anger. He went to apologize to Owen and told him that it wasn't him that he was mad at; it was Mark. Owen accepted his apology and advised him to let go of his anger.  \n\nWhen Owen began dating Amelia, Derek was very supportive of them. When he died, Owen, having lost yet another friend, left Seattle and joined another tour in Iraq in order to escape the feeling of loss. When he returned, he and Amelia mourned Derek together.  \n\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMark took an instant dislike to Owen after Owen refused to allow him to do a consult on a burn patient. Shortly after, Mark was angered with him because he let [[Alex Karev|Karev]] use skin glue, and was complaining (with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]]) that the patient could have lost half of his face. Despite this initial argument, Owen and Mark later bonded and were quite good friends until Mark's death.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nOwen and Callie were on good terms since the beginning, and Callie was one of the first people to notice the spark between him and Cristina. After an awkward encounter, when Callie found Owen standing naked in Cristina's bedroom after their failed first date, she and Owen bonded as they operated on Mark's penile fracture, and Callie even gave Owen advice on how to appease Cristina after the date fiasco.\n\nAfter Callie had stopped Owen from strangling Cristina to death in his sleep, Callie and Meredith didn't allow Owen to approach Cristina for a while, but after the incident had been forgiven, Callie and Owen stayed on good terms. After the plane crash, they became friends as they relied on each other during the bad times of their relationships. \n\n[[Ethan Dawson]]\nEthan, a -year-old boy, came to the hospital after a car accident that had left both of his parents in critical condition. He almost instantly bonded with Owen, who took care of him while his parents were in surgery. After his father Paul fell into a coma and mother Rachel died of a seizure, Owen comforted Ethan, and when he was rushed to the ER after overdosing on his grandmother Nancy's sleeping pills, Owen expressed deep, almost paternal concern of his wellbeing. When Nancy told Owen that she was considering giving Ethan into custody because she was not capable of taking care of him, he found himself considering whether he should adopt him. After asking (and receiving) advice from Meredith, Owen decided to go for it, but before he could proceed, Cristina managed to wake Paul, reuniting Ethan with his father. Owen then ordered them to be transferred to Seattle Pres for safety from a superstorm that was approaching Seattle.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMeredith and Owen share a turbulent relationship and they often clash, mainly because of their different views on Cristina and what's best for her. After the strangling incident, Meredith was very protective of Cristina and had a lukewarm demeanor toward Owen for a long time. With time, however, she began to soften to Owen, and at his and Cristina's wedding, she finally accepted Owen and told Cristina that he was \"perfect\". \n\nAfter Owen allowed Cristina to quit being a surgeon in the wake of the hospital shooting, Meredith was furious at Owen for letting Cristina \"completely fall apart\". This led to a huge argument, with Meredith claiming to know what Cristina needs better than Owen, and Owen reminding Meredith that Cristina isn't her. After the argument, the two were on very cold terms. \n\nWhen Owen and Cristina had a fight over the abortion of their baby, Meredith said to Owen that she was raised herself by [[Ellis Grey|a Cristina]] and that the guilt of resenting her own kid would almost kill Cristina. Owen then decided to support his wife in her decision, although he didn't completely deal with it. In the wake of the abortion, Owen and Cristina were very distant, which eventually lead Cristina to fear that Owen was cheating on her. When she mentioned it to Meredith, she reassured her friend that it was highly unlikely that Owen was cheating. In the end, however, Cristina's fears became a reality, and Meredith advised Cristina to leave Owen, calling him \"a pig\". \n\nAfter the plane crash and Cristina's move to Minnesota, Meredith and Owen became closer again, as they both missed Cristina. After her return, Owen and Meredith were on good terms. Owen even turned to Meredith for advice during his inner struggle on whether he should adopt Ethan or not, and Meredith kindly listened to him and, surprisingly, encouraged him to proceed with the matter, even though she knew Cristina would never like the idea.\n\nAfter Cristina's departure, Owen and Meredith became friends, Meredith having promised to Cristina to look out for him. When he became moody following Nathan Riggs' arrival at the hospital, she was the only person he allowed near him, shutting even Amelia out. Meredith then became the first person to find out about Owen's secret sister.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], x</ref>\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nWhen Kepner showed potential as a trauma surgeon, Owen became her teacher, and when she had a hard time being the Chief Resident, he gave her advice on how to stop being an administrator and start being the leader. When April failed her [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|boards]], Owen had to fire her, though he later realized what a mistake that was and flew all the way to Ohio to re-hire April. Since that, Owen and April have made a good team in trauma and have become friends, with Owen consoling and supporting her during her second pregnancy, and April being his best man at his wedding to Amelia. \n\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\n[[File:Owengeorgealex.jpg|thumb|right|px|Owen works with George and Alex.]]\n\nWhen George and Alex were on his service, he discovered that George got calmer under pressure and told him that trauma should be his specialty. He assigned George to his service for a month. George took a shine to Owen and vice-versa, and Owen hugged him upon hearing that he was joining the Army.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nWhen Owen came to work at Seattle Grace, Alex admired him but did not know whether to be on his side or Mark and Derek's. For a short while, he stayed on Owen's service but after discovering George's raw talent, Owen paid more attention to George and his relationship with Alex did not advance.\n\nAfter becoming chief of surgery at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]], Alex recruited Owen to improve the trauma department.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nIzzie took an instant dislike to Owen, after he stabbed six pigs for the residents to save, in order to learn to work with \"live tissue.\" She was not put on his service after that and neither really spoke to or about the other. After she recovered from her own neurosurgery, Hunt had her on his service but after losing their patient he told her that she can't be a patient and a doctor at the same time.\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nFollowing Meredith and Cristina's fight, Owen bonded with Derek and people began to warm-up to him. When Derek started to suffer from depression, Bailey sent Callie and Owen to the woods to bring Derek. Owen initially refused but when she started to stare him down he said, \"People don't usually say no to you, do they?\"\n\nAfter Owen became the [[Chief of Surgery]], Bailey gave him a hard time, but eventually, Owen won her over. When Owen talked about his infidelity with Meredith, Bailey overheard the conversation and later showed compassion towards Owen, telling him that \"You did a terrible thing. It doesn't mean you're a terrible person.\"\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nThe Chief took a liking to him when Owen first appeared, and now they are close friends.\n\n[[Arizona Robbins]]\nArizona and Owen are on good terms. When Arizona was suffering from phantom limb pain, Owen started to help her defeat the pain. When nothing else worked, he ordered Alex Karev to stab her in the prosthesis with a scalpel in the OR, which drove the pain away.\n\n\nOwen is a very skillful and innovative doctor, hardworking, quick-witted, and relentless. He has respect for his patients and demands the same from his residents and colleagues. His training as an Army trauma surgeon allows him to use even the most simple household objects (e.g. a ballpoint pen) as surgical tools, and he is known to improvise when facing a lack of proper equipment. As a surgeon he works hard, even working three days straight, and in addition to taking care of the ER, he also takes some general surgery cases every now and then. According to him, he became a doctor because he wanted to help people, and because no one could read his handwriting. \n\nHe attended [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard]] and completed his [[Resident|residency]] in [[General Surgery|general surgery]] at [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]]. He then worked at Maryland Shock Trauma, making quite a name for himself there, according to [[Richard Webber]]. Shortly after /, he joined the army and became an army trauma surgeon. During his time in Iraq, he saw and experienced terrible things that would haunt him for a long time, such as seeing many of his friends and colleagues get shot or blown to pieces. He stayed in Iraq until one day his entire platoon of  was killed in an RPG ambush, leaving him as the sole survivor, and he was honorably discharged from the army. He then returned to Seattle and took up the post of [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Trauma Surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], restoring it to a level one trauma center.\n\nAt first, Owen had some trouble with making a transition from Army field medicine to civilian traumas, and his aggressive course of treatment and unwillingness to ask help from the other attendings was frowned upon by Derek Shepherd and Mark Sloan, who quickly started calling him names, such as \"Rambo\" and \"Meatballer\". However, Owen quickly adjusted to working in a civilian hospital and learned to page help instead of doing everything himself. His surgical skills soon impressed his colleagues, and George described them as \"amazing\", while Callie described Owen as \"meticulous.\"\n\nOver the next few months, Owen also started teaching residents in trauma and how to work quickly and efficiently in hard circumstances. His teaching methods were rather unusual and slightly unorthodox, for example, teaching his residents how to work with \"live tissue\" by stabbing six pigs and asking his residents to save them. He also taught his residents to respect their patients and trust more on their own evaluation instead of always relying on attendings.  \n\nDuring Derek's depressed period, Hunt revealed as a second-year resident, he lost the parents of three children, and it haunts him every day. When Derek commented that he expected a story about Iraq, Owen stated that he doesn't talk about Iraq. He did, however, tell Cristina one story about Iraq: how he had once laid still on top of a severely mangled bomb victim for two hours, preventing him from bleeding to death, something that he described as his \"best and worst\" surgery.\n\nOwen's level-headedness and professionalism caught the eye of [[Chief of Surgery|Chief]] Webber, and Owen soon became his right-hand man, Webber putting him in charge of selecting both the winner of the resident solo-surgery and the chief resident. He also placed Owen in charge whenever the hospital faced a crisis or emergency, given his training in working under pressure. \n\nAfter Webber stepped down as Chief of Surgery after taking the blame for Meredith's tampering of the drug trial, he asked Owen to take over his position. Owen accepted the offer and became the new Chief of Surgery at Seattle Grace Mercy West, much to the surprise of his colleagues. At first, Owen was struggling with his new position, feeling deskbound, and it didn't take him long to start drinking, so Derek took him to his construction site and advised him to improvise. The next day Owen gave up his office, saying that from now on, his office would be wherever he was. Using a tablet-like device to manage the hospital, he was able to carry his office with him and free himself to work in the Pit and do surgeries. \n\nOwen's position as the Chief of Surgery was threatened, however, during the aftermath of the lawsuit. After doing everything in his power to prevent the hospital from going under, he and the plane crash survivors were able to buy the hospital with the help of the Harper Avery Foundation, and the doctors were nominated as the new Board of Directors. In their first meeting, Jackson Avery brought up the Foundation's recommendation to replace Owen Hunt as Chief of Surgery in order to \"increase the morale\". This recommendation was met with utter disgust by the other board members, but when Owen heard of the recommendation from Cristina, he was enraged and after an argument between him, Avery and Shepherd decided to quit, leaving the hospital in chaos. Cristina then made Derek apologize to him, and he agreed to return as Chief of Surgery if the ER would be reopened, a condition to which everyone agreed. \n\nOwen stayed on as Chief for about two more years until Derek's death made him realize he had grown tired of the job. He resigned from the position and went on another tour with April, after which he came back as the Head of Trauma. He held that position until voluntarily stepping down to give Teddy Altman said job, becoming a regular attending trauma surgeon.\n\nWhen Owen clashed with Tom, he resigned from Grey Sloan Memorial and was hired as Head of Trauma at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] under Chief Alex Karev. When Alex took personal leave, Owen acted as Interim Chief. The hospital was purchased by the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]] and closed for business. The entire staff interviewed for jobs at Grey Sloan and Owen was reinstated as Head of Trauma once again.\n\n\n*Owen holds a rank of Major in the U.S. Army.\n*Cristina took down her ceiling fan because Owen told her it's one of the triggers to his PTSD.\n*Owen went to Harvard before he commissioned in the Army.\n*Owen is left-handed.\n*He has a Yelp rating of . stars.\n*He has messy handwriting.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: Message of Hope]]</ref>\n*Owen has broken up all but two of the fights among the men since his first appearance.

She wasn't sure about it, but she wanted to wait before running any more tests, as they were much more invasive. She gave Andy muscle relaxants and discharged him.\n\nAndy came back into the ER later after vomiting all night because of the pain. Arizona wanted to run a D MRI, but Pam's insurance wouldn't cover it and [[Richard Webber]] said the hospital couldn't afford to pay for it, so he told her to discharged Andy and refer him back to his primary care physician.

Parker had a few small facial lacerations and a wrist injury, which required splinting, while Brooke had a perforation of her duodenum and was taken directly into surgery. While they were operating, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] thought of alternatives to why Brooke might have driven off the bridge other than just snapping under the pressure. She suggested an insulinoma, a tumor on the pancreas which would cause an extra secretion of insulin, which explained all her symptoms, including the low blood sugar she had in the ER. They did a trauma whipple to repair the other damage while pathology reviewed her scans, looking for the tumor. They came up with nothing, but Meredith was still convinced it was there, so she looked by hand. It was small, about the size of the head of a pin, but it was there. They removed it and in recovery, they told her husband that all her symptoms, the fatigue, irritability, and stress, were all due to the tumor and now that they had removed it, she'd make a full recovery.\n\n\n\nParker lives with his parents and his sister, Mia.

Before that, she was a resident at [[Dillard Medical Center]], prior to its closure, who treated [[Derek Shepherd]] after his car accident.\n\n\n\nAs a child, Penny moved every two years due to her mother's job. ''(\"[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\")''\n\nShe hated high school, which she attributes to cheerleaders. ''(\"[[All Eyez on Me]]\")''\n\n\nPenny was one of the doctors who tended to Derek Shepherd when he came into the Dillard ER. She put in his chest tube and his thoughts indicated that he liked her, said she was smart. She wanted to order a head CT, but [[Paul Castello]] insisted that they didn't have time and they needed to take him into surgery to get his abdominal bleeding under control.\n\nWhile they were on the way to the OR, she made one final plea to get the CT, since he was stable. Paul again declined and they took Derek into surgery and started operating. When he became unstable, Paul finally remembered that he'd had a head laceration and had the anesthesiologist check his eyes, which revealed a blown right pupil. They paged the neurosurgeon, [[Dr. Cohn]], who said he'd be there in  minutes because he was at a dinner. Despite this, it took him an hour and a half to arrive. Penny called him out on this and he responded that they should have gotten a head CT and they would have paged him sooner. When she continued to say that he should have gotten there faster because Derek might have had a chance if he had, he kicked her out of the OR.\n\nShe went with Dr. Cohn to speak to Meredith about Derek's death and Meredith told them that the decision not to get a CT was a bad decision.\n\nWhen Meredith exited the hospital, Penny was on a bench outside crying. She went up to Meredith to apologize again, but Meredith told her that Derek was her one, the patient whose face she'll see every time she treats a patient. He'll haunt her and remind her that he died on her watch. It'll either make her a better doctor or she'll quit and Meredith says she doesn't get to spend what would have been the rest of Derek's life being a quitter and then sends her back inside because she's not saving any lives outside. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n\nLong after Derek's death, Penny began seeing [[Callie Torres]]. They dated for a while and Callie invited Penny to come to a dinner party at Meredith's with her. She and Meredith were both shocked to see each other when Callie and Penny arrived at the party. Penny did not know that Callie was good friends with Derek and Meredith and Callie did not know about Penny being a resident at the hospital Derek died in. ''(\"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\")''\n\nPenny tried repeatedly to get Callie to let them leave the party, but Callie, thinking it was just nerves about meeting Arizona and her other friends, insisted that Penny stay, even when Callie herself got called to the hospital. Meredith kept quiet about the connection to Penny, but it came out when Penny was asked about why she was transferring to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. The doctors were all shocked by the news and Penny left the house. Later, after coming back in to use the bathroom, Penny met up with Meredith, who had come back downstairs after going up to hide in her bedroom. Penny said she'd ask for a transfer so they wouldn't have to work together, but Meredith told her that she'd see her on Monday and not to be late. ''(\"[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\")''\n\n\nOn her first day at GSM, Penny was assigned to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] service. She helped Meredith treat [[Robert Matthews]], but Meredith critiqued her every step of the way and eventually kicked her off her service. However, after speaking to Richard, Meredith agreed to give Penny another chance and asked for her on her service for the rest of the week. ''(\"[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\")''\n\n\nMeredith continued to have Penny on her service, running her ragged. Penny eventually confronted Meredith, saying that she could hate her, but she hadn't let Penny quit, so she shouldn't quit either. And if Meredith wasn't going to teach her, she should let her go. Meredith later let her help with a kidney transplant. ''(\"[[Something Against You]]\")''\n\n\nPenny found Meredith after she was attacked by [[Lou]]. She helped treat her initial injuries and then followed her recovery. When Meredith had a panic attack after a visit with her kids didn't go well, Penny cut the wires holding the broken jaw together. Jackson yelled at her for it, but she defended that Meredith needed air and her jaw could be re-wired the next morning. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] came into the ER, Penny was given the case because of her relationship with Callie. However, she hadn't yet met Sofia. When Callie found out that Penny had treated Sofia without paging her, she claimed that Arizona wasn't comfortable with Penny meeting Sofia yet. Penny immediately went to Arizona to apologize, but Arizona said that she had no part in it and Callie had lied. Penny believed it was because she'd told Callie she loved her the previous night. Callie later told Penny they were on the same page and invited her to get ice cream with her and Sofia. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the opportunity came up for Penny to apply for the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]], she initially decided she didn't want to because she believed she didn't have a chance at it. However, she ultimately decided to apply after overhearing other residents dismissing her. She had support of several attendings and was given the grant, which funds a year of residential research at the Preminger Research Center. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\nWhen the time came to say whether or not she was accepting the grant, Penny consulted with Callie, not wanting to make a decision without talking to her first. After talking, they decided they'd both go to New York. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\n\nPenny testified on Callie's behalf at the hearing to determine who would receive custody of Sofia. Despite being flustered and unable to remember what grade Sofia was in or what she'd been wearing that day, she demonstrated knowledge of Sofia's likes and routine. After Arizona was awarded sole custody of Sofia, Penny tried to comfort Callie, but Callie pulled away from her. ''(\"[[Mama Tried]]\")''\n\n\nPenny wanted to delay her move to New York because Callie wouldn't be able to join her with Sofia. However, Callie told her it would just delay the inevitable resentment and broken promises if they tried long distance and they ended things. Penny then packed up her things and told Meredith she was accelerating her departure. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\nPenny was dating Callie Torres. She was not aware of Callie's friendship with Meredith Grey until Callie brought her to a dinner party at [[Meredith's House]]. ''(\"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\")''\n\nAfter the dinner party, they didn't speak for a few days because Penny thought Callie was taking Meredith's side, though Callie said she was on both sides. However, after Penny's first day at Grey Sloan Memorial, they both agreed they were in it. ''(\"[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\")''\n\nPenny constantly being on Meredith's service upset Callie, which strained their relationship. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\nThey broke up briefly, but they met in a stairwell at work and Callie admitted to Penny that she missed her and Penny kissed her. ''(\"[[All I Want is You]]\")''\n\nOne night, as they were in bed getting ready to sleep, Penny told Callie she loved her. Callie replied, \"Thank you.\" The next day, after Penny treated Sofia, Callie told her that she was on the same page and she'd been there for a while, but she had a history of being on that page too early in the past, which is why she was hesitant. ''(\"[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\")''\n\nWhen Penny won the [[Resident#Preminger Grant|Preminger Grant]], which would require moving to New York for a year, she didn't ask Callie to go with her, feeling it wasn't possible. However, Callie told her to do it and they decided to move to New York together with Sofia. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\nWhen Callie lost the case for sole custody, things quickly soured between her and Penny. Penny told Callie she wanted to wait to leave until things were good between them again, but Callie said it wouldn't work because she couldn't leave without Sofia and long-distance would fizzle out quickly. When Penny asked if they were breaking up, Callie said it would be best to end things now instead of dragging it out. ''(\"[[At Last]]\")''\n\nAfter Penny left, Callie was miserable, which led Arizona to decide to allow Callie to take Sofia to New York with her and have her for a greater part of the year, leading Callie to move to New York to be with Penny again. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\nThey broke up an undetermined time later, revealed when Arizona comments that she and Callie are both single and making each other smile again. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n\nHer mother is a petroleum seismologist, so they moved every two years.\n\n\nAfter starting work at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], Penny began to bond with the other residents, particularly [[Stephanie Edwards]], [[Jo Wilson]], and [[Ben Warren]].\n\n\n[[Paul Castello]]\nPaul, one of her co-workers, seemed to have little respect for her. Over her objections, he refused to take Derek for the head CT that might have saved his life. Derek's thoughts said that Paul didn't like Penny because she was smarter than him, even though she's younger, and probably because she's a woman. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nPenny had a rough start with Meredith during her first days at Grey Sloan Memorial. She was put under Meredith's service\uadespite hating her for \"killing Derek\". Meredith was asking her questions about procedures while they work on\ua[[Robert Matthews]]\uabut was being intimidated by her, being unable to answer her questions.\ua''(\"[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\")''\n\nAfter being reprimanded by Webber, Meredith started trusting Penny with procedures. However, she was giving her a lot of workload, causing Penny to call Meredith out.\ua''(\"[[Something Against You]]\")''\n\nPenny was seen talking to Meredith while they were on their way to save\ua[[Brian Carson]], seemingly asking to join the team but\ua[[Jo Wilson]]\uawas already going.\ua''(\"[[All Eyez on Me]]\")''\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd]]\nWhen Penny was hired to work at GSM, Amelia refused to work with her. However, they were forced to work together when [[Richard Webber]] scrambled the attending/resident pairs. After seeing Penny work on [[Griffin McColl]], Amelia admitted that she was a born neurosurgeon, which meant Amelia would have to start teaching her.\ua''(\"[[Odd Man Out]]\")''\n\n\nPenny was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Dillard Medical Center]]. However, when Dillard closed, she was [[Resident#Re-Matching|re-matched]] to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to continue her residency. She's currently represents [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] at the Preminger Research Center.\n\n\n*Although her name was not mentioned in [[How to Save a Life]], closed captioning and subtitles displayed her name as Edie, however, she was re-introduced in [[Old Time Rock and Roll]] as [[Callie Torres|Callie's]] girlfriend named Penny.\n*She was in college before she ever tried macaroni and cheese.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], x</ref>\n*She liked physics.<ref>[[My Next Life]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxPenny.png|[[How to Save a Life]]\nxPenny.png|[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[Something Against You]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[The Sound of Silence]]\nxPennyBlake.png|[[All I Want is You]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[My Next Life]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[All Eyez on Me]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Odd Man Out]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[When It Hurts So Bad]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[I Wear the Face]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[There's a Fine, Fine Line]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Trigger Happy]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[Mama Tried]]\nxPenelopeBlake.png|[[At Last]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Penelope Blake Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Penny Blake]]\n[[de:Penelope Blake]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blake, Penelope}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She was discovered to have a new hematoma in her temporal lobe. The blood pressure was causing symptoms of Capgras syndrome. They took her back into surgery to relieve the pressure.

That's up to you.|'''Richard Webber'''}}\n\n'''Richard Webber''' is an [[attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]]\uaand the current [[Resident#Program Director|Residency Program Director]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]; and the current Chief Medical Officer of the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]].\uaHe is also the former [[Chief of Surgery]] at both [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. During his residency, he had an affair with [[Ellis Grey]], but he left her because he was jealous of her career. He was married to [[Adele Webber]] until her death and is now married to [[Catherine Fox]].\n\n\n\nNot much is known about Richard's childhood. His mother, [[Gail Webber|Gail]], died of pancreatic cancer when he was ten. He has a brother named [[Chris Webber]] and a sister.\n\n\nDuring residency, he grew close with [[Ellis Grey]]. They started having an affair together, planning to leave their spouses to have a life together. Ellis told her husband, but Richard overheard that she was on the shortlist for the Harper Avery Award, and decided to stay with his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]]. He was jealous of her career and he didn't want to feel that way for the rest of his life.\n\n\nRichard started having trouble seeing, and not completing simple surgeries. It turned out that he had developed a tumor, pressing against his optic nerve, and let Derek operate to remove it, under the radar of all the surgical floor. Later, he fought with Derek to write him out for surgery.\n\n\nRichard was later found to be off the wagon and drinking again. This caused him to lose his job as Chief of Surgery for a period of time to [[Derek Shepherd]], who told the board about his problem even though Meredith had attempted to stop him. He eventually sobered up again and after Derek stepped down following the shooting, he was able to regain the position.\n\n\nHis wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]], was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. When Adele was accepted on to Derek's Alzheimer's trial, Meredith tampered with the trial by ensuring Adele received the active drug, rather than a placebo.\uaOnce news of the tampering came to light, Richard took the fall for Meredith, leading to his resignation as Chief of Surgery, whilst remaining an attending general surgeon. Throughout the next year, Richard dealt with her Alzheimer's becoming worse. She eventually asked Richard to place her in the [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]]. Richard visited her a lot as he wanted to assure her that he was still there for her, but soon after she stopped recognizing him and started a romantic relationship with Allan, a fellow resident in the care facility. At first, Richard resisted, thinking Allan was taking advantage, but he soon realized Allan had Alzheimer's too and that his anger wasn't helping Adele. He then allowed Allan to take his place.\n\n\nRichard and Catherine were both examiners at the boards exam. The night before the Boards, Catherine and Richard ended up sleeping together. That is when their relationship started.\n\n\nNot long after that, Adele died of a heart attack after coming out of surgery.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter his electrocution, Richard briefly opened his eyes to see how [[Heather Brooks|Heather]], the first one to find him in the basement, got electrocuted herself and severely bumped her head. Both she and Richard were later found by Shane, who alarmed other doctors. Together with Cristina, Bailey started taking care of Richard. While his labs showed that his lactate was two, Richard started coding but they managed to revive him, after which Cristina successfully pulled off the difficult procedure to place a balloon pump without rupturing Richard's aorta. This stabilized Richard's heart and he was sent to the ICU. When his labs came back again, Richard's lactate was six, and Bailey felt he had an acute abdomen. She was worried and wanted to operate on him to look for and repair possible intra-abdominal tissue damage, but Cristina insisted his heart couldn't handle the surgery. They kept bickering until Owen reminded them to look into his medical directive. Meredith turned out to be his medical proxy, and she decided to run his labs again, and if the lactate was above six, they could operate. A little later, his labs showed that his lactate was nine, so he was wheeled into the OR with some of the doctors watching him.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n[[File:xWebberelectrocuted.png|thumb|xpx|Richard is unconscious after being electrocuted.]]\nHowever, the surgery was interrupted by\ua[[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]], who yelled at Owen and Bailey to close him up. As they hadn't found anything on the bowels yet and Richard's heart started to get unstable again, they listened to her and closed him up. Richard stabilized again after he was closed up. Catherine demanded access to Richard's chart and labs, and started to plan to move him to another hospital once he was stable enough. However, behind her back, Meredith was convinced by Bailey's feeling that something's wrong inside his abdomen, and doing nothing about it is worse than operating. She took her phone and booked an OR for Bailey to explore Richard's abdomen again. They did find necrotic tissue around the pancreas, and Bailey was extremely happy. \"When you know, you know!\" she said, just as Richard always taught them. After surgery, Richard was taken back to the ICU. As Catherine started bickering with Bailey and Meredith over how he still hadn't regained consciousness, Richard opened his eyes just as Meredith told Catherine that Richard chose her to be his family and to make his decisions for him.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nHis recovery didn't start out well as he continued to lose weight. Meredith was on maternity leave, so Bailey was now in charge of his case. When presenting the case, Shane recommended a feeding tube, but Richard refused this with Bailey supporting him in this. Behind Bailey and Richard's backs, Shane called Meredith to inform her of Richard's condition and she advised him to already order a feeding tube so it would be ready whenever Richard was ready to have it. Shane did so, but Bailey and Richard found out. They were not going to change their course of treatment, and Shane was ordered to bring Richard some soup. From outside the room, Shane noticed how much difficulties Richard was having to swallow it. When Cristina informed her over the phone that Richard still didn't have a feeding tube, Meredith felt like she abandoned Richard and failed to be a good family member, so she came to the hospital to read his labs herself. She and Shane tried to convince Bailey, who supported Richard in his decision not to have a feeding tube because it completely takes away one's dignity. Meredith pointed out that dying does too, and that would happen if they wouldn't place a feeding tube. Bailey then agreed to have another look at Richard's swallow studies with her. While they were doing so, Shane entered Richard's room and listed the consequences of not allowing a feeding tube. He told Richard that he was offering to place the tube now that they were alone, or they could wait for Meredith to do it. Richard realized that a feeding tube was necessary and allowed Shane to place it. That evening, Meredith sat by his bedside, apologizing for being such a bad family. He aggressively told her that she wasn't his family and that he had made the wrong decision to make her his medical proxy as she was too weak and sentimental. He said that she shouldn't have brought him back to life, meaning he would rather be dead right now. Meredith then let go of his hand as he turned his head away from her.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nHe continued down the path of self-destruction. Meredith told Bailey, who kept on worrying, that forcing treatment wouldn't help, he just needed to hit rock bottom. Bailey then instructed a nurse to start Richard on CPAP, which the nurse said he wouldn't like. Bailey said he didn't have to like it, he just had to do it. However, when the nurse came to his room, he started fighting her and said he didn't want breathing treatments. Bailey came into the room and told him about her other patient, who wouldn't stop fighting despite having no options. This was contrasted with Richard, who had many options but refused to try. She stated she wasn't okay with letting him die like Meredith was, so she was giving a choice. He then reached for the breathing apparatus, but only to throw it across the room. Bailey then wrestled with him to get him to wear the oxygen mask until he aggressively pushed her away into a chair. However, Bailey put [[Gene Seers|her patient]] in Richard's room, where the patient pointed out that Richard didn't look like he would be around much longer. Bailey gave them brochures for facilities that do end-of-life care, figuring that they could go through them together as they were in the same boat. While talking with Gene, Richard realized he didn't want to die in the hospital and took the breathing apparatus to start working on his lungs, with Bailey watching and smiling from outside the room.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nTogether, they continued working on his recovery until he was able to stand up and walk to the chair in his room. They called Catherine to show her the progress they made. When he showed her what he could do, he refused to accept help from Bailey, who smilingly pointed out he was now acting all too cool for school because Catherine was in the room. Leah and Shane felt a little awkward when they had to strip his JP drain and they helped him get back in bed, while Bailey and Catherine talked outside about his recovery. She expected more of the recovery, but Bailey says all he needs is support. Noticing how awkward the interns were acting when they needed to examine Richard, Catherine wanted him to come home with her. She pointed out he wasn't progressing in this hospital, as they were all coddling him because they love and fear him. Ultimately, it was a disservice to him and Catherine added he needed to be pushed and not coddled. Keeping this in mind, he told Leah that coddling makes her a bad doctor and he ordered her to give him a proper hands-on examination. Catherine overheard how Leah correctly diagnosed a pancreatic leak and complimented the bossy Richard as she came into the room. As Leah left, Richard said that the interns would have to learn to look him in the eye and answer his questions. He then answered her question to come home with her, saying that he needed to stay in the hospital as they needed him there.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nDetermined to teach the interns, Richard used his physical condition as a teaching tool. He had constant shoulder pain and he wanted Jo to come up with the correct diagnosis. Meredith interrupted to ask Bailey something about portal vein graft research, and Richard replied that it was her mother's research. She has written about it in one of the journals gave him. Back to his case, Richard told Jo that she would be kicked off the case if she couldn't find a solid answer about his pain. Her first attempt was to attach him to a scanner. While she was trying to get a clear read, Richard pulled off the sensors. He told her the pain wasn't caused by his heart or something he did, and he advised her to look deeper. She then came up with doing X-rays. He asked her what she thought she would find. Something clicked in her head and she suddenly realized he needed an ultrasound instead. Doing the ultrasound, she enthusiastically diagnosed him with a pancreatic pseudocyst. She started cheering because she found the answer, and explained how she got to it. He told her to work on her bedside manner and she apologized. He smiled and said he finally felt like he was in good hands.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Jo diagnosed him with the pancreatic pseudocyst, Richard revealed he would allow one of the second-year residents to perform the surgery to fix it. Stephanie was already out, as she walked into a wall after her eye surgery. Bailey doubted they were capable of doing the surgery, but they were able to walk her through the procedure. Richard then tasked Bailey to observe the residents in the ER and decide which one was going to operate. In the ER, Leah and Shane dropped out too. Bailey started ranting about how incompetent the residents were, but Richard came to their defense and said that she was the problem. Teaching the residents is the only thing that kept him going when it was still unsure he'd ever operate again, and she was standing in the way of that as she wouldn't let them learn. He said he'd have someone else supervise them and fired her from his case. He then asked Meredith to observe the residents and choose one to perform the cystogastrostomy. She told him she didn't have time as she had a Halloween party to get to, but when he said he would have never gotten where he was now if it weren't for her and begged her to help him teach the residents, she agreed. She chose Jo, who pulled off the surgery with success. After the surgery, Richard asked Meredith to talk to him through the whole surgery from the beginning, but Meredith allows Jo to do this in the interest of education.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nWhenever he wasn't teaching, Richard filled his days by telling old surgical stories over and over again to anyone who would listen. One of his many stories taught Stephanie the two-challenge rule. His next-door neighbor, CJ, got tired of it when he asked the residents to come back for the end of a story and yelled from her room that everyone knows the end because he'd told it so many times. He held off on exercise, which Meredith noticed. She asked if he was planning to leave the hospital because his room didn't look like he was. CJ walked by and asked him to join her on her walk, so he could hear some new stories, which she told him he needed. He said he'd catch up with her later, again refusing to get out of bed. Later that day, she was talking him through a recipe when she suddenly stopped talking as Richard heard a clattering. Richard then rushed out of bed and saw CJ collapsed on the floor. He called for help and asked for a crash cart as he started performing CPR on CJ. After he saved CJ, Richard felt exhausted in a good way. He told April that it was time for him to start working to get out of bed and be himself again. At the end of the day, Richard checked on CJ and took a walk with Callie, while telling her the story of what happened that day.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\nIn a wheelchair, Richard left the hospital for the first time in months when April drove him to the courthouse to support Callie during her malpractice lawsuit.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\nTo get out of the hospital, Richard had to pass a treadmill stress test. He failed every time but pushed Jo and Meredith to allow another one. In his room, he tried to convince Meredith he was a waste of a bed, but she replied his stress test was a disaster. He claimed he had been practicing and was thereby another man than he was last week. Meredith proposed to get him into a rehab facility as he couldn't go home on his own, but Richard refused and said he'd get a home health aid. This convinced Meredith to allow another test, which he said he'd pass, flying colors. She then invited him to the Thanksgiving Dinner at her house, and he accepted the invitation when he found out she wasn't cooking the dinner. While preparing for the treadmill test, he and Jo started talking about preparing a Thanksgiving turkey. During the treadmill test, Jo wanted to stop because his heart rate was pretty high. He wanted her to take up the treadmill, but when she refused, he did it himself. He had to start running, but couldn't keep up and fell off the treadmill. Jo called for help, and Derek and Callie came in, confirming his own diagnosis of broken ribs. Because she felt sorry about what happened, Jo and the other interns decided to hang out with Richard at the hospital at Thanksgiving. As none of them could cook a turkey, they decided to settle on fried chicken and biscuits.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he healed up, Richard passed the stress test and he was allowed to leave the hospital with a box filled with his personal stuff. He was wheeled to the elevator with several doctors seeing him off. He didn't understand why they were making such a big deal out of it and said he wanted a break from all of them. Bailey said he got himself better, but he said she was the one who did that. Not long after, Richard came back to the hospital. He met Bailey in the surgical skills lab, as he wanted to practice his skills for his return to surgery and didn't want to just sit around at home. Unknown to him, Bailey was trying to do  stitches without showing OCD behavior. He rearranged the surgical instruments on her tray. Later, Bailey yelled at Dr. Alma that she wasn't going to take the pills. Richard offered to join her to April's bridal shower to take a break, but she declined. After having yelled compliments and eaten a lot of finger food at the shower, Richard returned to the skills lab. He said that she called him a drunk before the accident. She started apologizing for that, but he said she was right: he is an alcoholic, which is why he was at the hospital instead of home because he was afraid he'd start drinking at home out of loneliness and boredom. He said he always wants a drink because he has a disease that can't be cured, only managed, but not alone. He told Bailey that she had to accept that she has a disease and needs help, after which she picked up the pill bottle and took one out of it.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nRichard scheduled his first little surgery back on the day of April's wedding. Almost everyone would be at the wedding, so there wouldn't be anyone around to make a big fuss about it. On the same day, Bailey started operating again and he told her he was proud of her. However, his plans had to change. While he was preparing for the surgery, Leah came running over and begged him for help. He accompanied her to the OR, where he found Shane staring at Jimmy Evans's chest. While ordering Leah to get rescrubbed, he asks Shane what they got. Shane kept on saying how he did this and that it's his fault while blocking Jimmy's chest with his hands. Richard took a look and concludes they needed bypass. He tried to convince Shane to take some rest, but Shane said that she would be dead when he'd come back. He added that it's his fault because he sent her to the basement. Richard then realized he was talking about Heather and what happened to her, remembering how he saw her get electrocuted. Richard assured Shane that she would be fine and that he needed to take some rest. As Shane left the OR, Richard got inside Jimmy's thorax and yelled to page someone from cardio. Jimmy deteriorated, leaving Richard performing heart massage on Alex's father.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Richard and Catherine get married.]]\n\n\nAfter some time being together, Catherine proposed to Richard in front of the entire hospital, and he agreed. They argued before the wedding and called it off briefly. However, they reconciled when Meredith helped them realize that life is too short to not be happy and together. They were married in the hospital chapel.<ref>[[You're My Home]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Bailey became Chief of Surgery, she hired Eliza Minnick to help re-shape the resident teaching program. While the residents enjoyed Minnick's program, the attendings, including Richard, felt they were being pushed out of their own surgeries. Eventually, Richard spoke up, and Bailey chose Minnick over Richard's position as director of the resident program. Most of the attendings sided with Richard, which led to Meredith being temporarily suspended for refusing to work with Minnick. Eventually, Bailey realized that Minnick's program was not as helpful as she thought, and she gave Richard back his old job title.\n\n\nOne day, Richard's sponsor, [[Olive Warner]], was admitted to the hospital and she asked for him. She told him she had reached her expiration date as her liver had already lasted longer than it should have and it also caused cardiomyopathy, which is why she was admitted. Eight months prior, she had signed a DNR and also drafted an advance directive for no intervention. Richard hated that she hadn't told him, but she said she took her personal problems to her own sponsor. Also, she didn't know how to sponsor him through her death. Richard then said he wouldn't let her die and brought in Maggie and Meredith. Ollie threatened to tell his secret to every doctor he brought in, but he had her blessing to tell them everything since they already knew. They had less trouble accepting that Ollie had reached the end of the road. She asked them to work on getting Richard to accept it and make sure he'd get through it without reaching for the bottle. They pretended that they were going to do more tests the next day and reached out to Catherine. Later, Bailey came to see him. He told her that Ollie was the keeper of his secrets and that she was how he felt God's presence. Bailey made sure he had a village of people who loved him.\n\nThe next day, Maggie and Meredith informed him that all possible options had a poor prognosis. He thought a small chance at survival was better than guaranteed death, but Ollie once again said she had made peace with it. He still thought keeping her alive was his job. Maggie later sat down with Richard and reminded her of everything she put her mother through against her wishes, which she had come to realize she only did for herself. He realized that he needed to give Ollie the ending that she wanted instead of repeating Maggie's mistake. Richard then brought Amelia to Ollie's room and they held a meeting, where he stated he had accepted the things he couldn't change.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], x</ref> Catherine arrived and made sure Richard was comfortable as he sat by Ollie's bed until she passed away. He cried over her body and later sought out Catherine. He told her he was doing fine and asked about her. She then revealed Jackson had unearthed a scandal relating to the Foundation that could ruin them all. She filled Richard in on all the details.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard demonstrates his Path Pen.]]\nShortly before Ollie's funeral, Richard gave a presentation on his Path Pen for the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. Upon his return to the hospital, he found out that several doctors had accidentally eaten weed cookies. Richard then got occupied with taking care of [[Vikram Roy]], who had neglected to tell his superiors that he, too, had eaten a contaminated cookie. He freaked out because of it while treating a patient and backed into a cart and fell, which ended with his arm being stabbed by a scalpel. Richard managed to stop the bleeding but later fired Vik for not coming clean about the cookie.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], x</ref>\n\nWhen news got out about Harper Avery's sexual harassment scandal, Richard sat down with Jackson and Catherine in several meetings with a crisis manager Catherine had hired to protect the Foundation. They shut down the woman's plan to go after the assaulted women to make the scandal go away. In between meetings, Amelia found Richard and told her about Betty and her plan to take her in and help her get sober. He liked the idea and advised her to really drag Betty if she saw something in her, as Ollie had done with him. If it worked, Amelia would be saving a life. Richard, Catherine, and the crisis manager drafted a press statement, but Jackson and Meredith came in with a plan to create a new foundation in Catherine's name that would pledge itself to re-hire and re-train all the women affected by the scandal.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Bailey was met with a lawsuit for wrongful termination by Vik, she asked Richard to come to her meeting with him. Richard later admitted he may have overreacted in firing Vik, because, unlike himself, Vik never operated under the influence. He suggested Bailey could make the case go away by apologizing. Bailey didn't want to apologize if she didn't mean it, but after [[Levi Schmitt]] pointed out that she had begun a surgery while high, she deemed it fit to re-hire Vik for a one-year probationary period. That worked and Vik dropped the lawsuit.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref> \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard confronts Arizona over her leaving without telling him.]]\nSoon after, Richard found out that Arizona was looking for a job in New York as she was planning to move there with Sofia. Unhappy with his close friend moving away, he confronted her about keeping it from him. Later, Richard treated [[Matthew Taylor]] while his colleagues worked on bringing April back. He was the one to inform Arizona of their accident. They all sat by April's bed in the ICU. When she showed no signs of recovery, Richard offered to be the one to call her parents. However, she eventually woke up without deficits.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard and the other guests congratulate the newlyweds.]]\nAt Alex and Jo's wedding, Richard confronted Meredith with her offering Jo an attending job. He thought she was only doing it to keep Alex in Seattle and said it was unfair to Jo as she deserved the extra training fellowship in Boston. He later overheard Arizona tell April that she was falling for Callie again and that that was a catastrophe. Together with April, he convinced her that it was actually a good thing. Arizona told the two of them that she was going to miss them and they hugged. When the wedding was called off due to several things going wrong, Richard and the other guests took the ferry back to the city, where he witnessed an impromptu wedding between Alex and Jo officiated by Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nEver since Ollie's death, Richard had stopped going to meetings but he also didn't start drinking again. Catherine stuck around to look after him. At work, Richard and Andrew treated [[Barry Clemens|a man]] who inserted one of his wife's hair products into his rectum. In surgery, Vik cauterized a bleed against Richard's advice, which ignited the hair spray and caused a fire in the man's abdomen. Vik was wounded by the can that was propelled across the room and taken away, while Richard and Andrew attempted to save Barry, to no avail.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref> Upon hearing that Bailey was looking for an interim Chief, Richard threw his name in the mix, but Bailey told him it wouldn't be him because she wanted the job back one day. She inquired if he had a new sponsor, but he stated he was just talking to Catherine. He thought the two of them had been talking behind his back, but they hadn't. Bailey said she just remembered what happened the last time he was Chief. With Ollie's death, she didn't want to add extra stress to his plate, which is why she chose not to appoint him interim Chief. He claimed he left for a meeting, but at the exit, he came across Andrew on his newly acquired motorcycle. He offered Richard to take a ride. Reluctantly, Richard got on, and, much to his surprise, he liked the feeling and asked for the helmet so he could take the ride.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n\nAlex was chosen as interim Chief instead. On Alex's first day, Richard treated [[Dave Buckley]], a teacher who collapsed at work while he was helping a kid lead a block into a table saw. His labs showed extremely high alcohol levels, which triggered Richard and made him determined to follow the case all the way through. In surgery, while Link was working on Dave's fingers with local anesthetics, Richard told Dave that this was what rock bottom looked like and that he needed to take responsibility. Dave maintained it was an accident and that he didn't drink. Richard berated Dave to get him to confess until Alex threw him off the case.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard challenges Dave's sobriety.]]\nAfter a mom of one of Dave's students insisted that she knew alcoholics and that Mr. Buckley wasn't one, Richard went to his room and challenged him by placing a bottle of vodka in front of Dave. However, he refused to drink, which Richard had never known an alcoholic to do. He ran labs again, which still showed that Dave was drunk. Richard then diagnosed auto-brewery syndrome. At the end of the day, Richard told Andrew he was missing his wife. Link and Andrew then invited Richard to come with them to Joe's, where they could also do other things beside drink alcohol.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nAs Chief, Alex asked Richard for advice when his patient refused surgery because his insurance didn't cover it. Richard only told him to be creative, refusing to do the job for him. Alex then stabbed the patient with a scalpel so the surgery would qualify as trauma surgery. Richard found out and yelled at him, saying he had opened himself up to serious consequences, but the patient was happy to have had the surgery and didn't press charges.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nRichard found out that his new friend Link and Jo went all the way back to undergrad. While Jo assured him their history wasn't romantic, Richard understood Alex's dismay over it as he felt the same about finding out that Catherine had a history with Tom. Throughout the day, Richard supervised Andrew as he took charge of the ER. He urged Andrew to take initiative while handling the interns and to remember that they were working at a teaching hospital. At the end of the day, he told Andrew he saw potential in him, so he wanted to push him to be the best he could be and also help Andrew to teach the interns to be their best selves. After work, Link, Andrew, and Richard went to Joe's, where Link and Andrew played their guitars while Richard sang \"The Thrill Is Gone.\"<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nRichard found out through an AA friend that [[Thatcher Grey]] had AML and that he only had a few weeks to live. He found Meredith and told her. The news about Thatcher made Richard visit Ollie's grave. He told her that it had been hard since she passed away and that he had avoided meetings because they only reminded him that she was gone.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nWith Catherine away to Los Angeles for Foundation business, Richard spent a few days by himself. At work, he treated [[Frankie Shavelson]], a pregnant, beloved nurse he was close with. She had a wandering spleen, which began to untwist by itself. While he was checking up on her, she expressed worries over him. He admitted it had been hard since Ollie's death and due to Catherine's frequent travels. He maintained that he was fine, though. However, the spleen problem played up again and Richard had to operate. Alex delivered the baby while Richard had trouble controlling the bleeding. Richard did his best, but Frankie passed away. He couldn't bring himself to call time of death, so Alex did that for him. He delivered the news to the other nurses.\n\nEqually distraught as the nurses, Richard finally found the motivation to go to a meeting again. The person speaking there mentioned a bar exchanging shots for AA chips. Richard then got up and left. Richard found the bar and showed the bartender his -year chip. The bartender poured him eight vodka shots per his order. Richard looked at the shots and grabbed his chip back. He then went behind the bar and grabbed a baseball bat, smashing the shots and all bottles on the shelves. The bartender threatened the call the police. Richard invited him to do so so that he could tell them how the man was taking advantage of vulnerable people who were struggling to hang onto everything they've got. Eventually, the police arrived and Richard was arrested. He called Meredith, who was out in Los Angeles with Catherine and had just helped diagnose Catherine's spinal tumor, and told her that he had been arrested. He made her promise not to tell Catherine.<ref>[[Anybody Have a Map?]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith flew back to Seattle and bailed him out. She then brought up the fact that he hadn't found a new sponsor yet. He admitted he lost control. Knowing Catherine would soon need help, she told him to get his head in a place where he could take care of the people who depend on him. Richard went to the hospital and told Bailey, who was stepping in for Alex due to his being trapped at home by the windstorm, about his arrest. He agreed to her plan to inform the board and bench him for the day. He went to check on Frankie's baby, who was surrounded by nurses. He then noticed he had three missed calls from Catherine and called her back. Much to his surprise, Tom answered the call. Richard thought Catherine was having an affair with him, so he decided to read the Bible to find serenity and then find himself a new sponsor. Bailey scoffed at the idea of Catherine having an affair. She then told him about her marriage sabbatical. He pointed out she was trying to fix the inside from the outside, which wouldn't work, so he advised her to get real help.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nRichard took charge when the storm caused a power outage at the hospital, trapping three elevators between floors. He had an altercation with the head of maintenance while urging him to get the doors open. In between, he tried to reach Catherine, but she still didn't answer his calls. He then came across Betty, who was looking for Amelia, and decided they would occupy their minds by being useful. They bonded a bit and she told him that she felt that if she could get clean for a few months, she could put her life back together and get Leo back. He advised her to take it one day at a time.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard catches Betty looking for drugs.]]\nHe was paged away and sent her back to the ER, but he later found her looking for drugs in a cabinet. She begged him not to tell Amelia, but he couldn't call himself a doctor if he complied with that request. After he watched Amelia convince Betty to accept a place in rehab, Richard was approached by Jackson, who asked if he had talked to his mother. Since he hadn't, Jackson took him to a private room so they could talk. Jackson then told him that Catherine had a grade  chondrosarcoma on her spine.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nIn light of Catherine's diagnosis, Richard resumed going to meetings regularly, where another attendee offered to be his new sponsor. At work, Richard, Catherine, and Jackson performed a pelvic exenteration together. Catherine struggled in surgery, so Jackson offered to take over for her. Furious over his confronting her with her cancer in public, she finished her part and left. Jackson and Richard found her cooling down in a lounge and confronted her about hiding her cancer from them. She told Richard she couldn't exactly lean on him with his going around demolishing bars. After Catherine dismissed Richard's jealousy of Tom, Jackson and Richard convinced her that they could handle bad news, so there was no need to lie to them. She then said telling them about the cancer made it real for her, after which she broke down and they comforted her.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Catherine's surgery, Richard went to a meeting in the morning. At work, he convinced Meredith to go see her father before it was too late and then joined Catherine in her room. Tom and Amelia came in to explain their approach. Richard took Catherine to the OR. She told him he didn't need to sit in the gallery the entire time and told him she'd see him on the other side. After a kiss and hug, they danced with the staff and Jackson to \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" the song that had kept Catherine calm through all the scans. The surgery started. Jackson couldn't handle sitting there so he left with Maggie, but Richard knew that Catherine secretly wanted him there because showing up for one another when they really needed it is how they made their long-distance relationship work. Bailey came to with him. When things got dire, Richard closed the gallery. He couldn't bring himself to watch the team flip Catherine on the table, so Bailey held his hand and informed him once it was over. When Tom and Amelia's approach had to be changed to removing the tumor piecemeal, Richard convinced them to use his Path Pen. They removed as much tumor as they could, but they to leave a small part behind in order to leave her brachial plexus unscathed and thus save her career. Catherine thanked them for saving her life and made peace with the fact that she would have to live with cancer for the rest of her life. Richard went outside to took a moment to gather himself and then joined Amelia to a meeting, where she talked about giving him his wife back and being grateful for being sober to experience every terrifying, exhilarating, imperfect moment of the surgery.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine had a hard time recovering over the holidays. She shut Richard out and refused any help. She went to bed early on Christmas Eve, leaving Richard to finish dinner with Maggie and Jackson. She also lashed out at her physical therapist, because she dismissed Catherine's request for exercises to get her sensual self back. Richard brought up average recovery time to convince her not to wear herself out, but she said she wasn't average and left the room. Jackson and Maggie regularly visited to check on them. During one particular visit, Catherine fell off the treadmill. She broke down in Richard's arms and told him she couldn't do this. However, over time, things went better. On Valentine's Day, Catherine apologized to him for having been impossible. He didn't want to hear her apologize as he couldn't imagine what she was going through, but he promised to be there for her for every step of it. He told her she couldn't be average if she tried. She then found her sexual appetite back and asked him to take her the bedroom, which he did.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Bailey grew increasingly frustrated with Alex occupying her job. With two weeks left, she raged that Alex was given credit in an article about the hospital's innovation. Richard said that's just how it goes sometimes and shared a story of how she performed emergency surgery on a patient he had been treating for years, which is why the patient now sent her a basket of pears every year instead of him.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Teddy and Richard save Betty.]]\nWhile Meredith was breaking the hospital's longest surgery record, the ER was flooded with victims from a mass overdose. Richard fetched all residents from the gallery and later found Owen working on Betty. Owen had Richard call Amelia. Richard watched over Betty while the doctors diagnosed an aortic dissection caused by the mixture of opioids and meth. Richard scrubbed in with Teddy to place a stent. That went well, but they found they had to also reconstruct the entire distal aorta. They managed to pull it off and Betty made it through surgery. At the end of the day, Richard, Teddy, and Link took a moment to rest in a quiet ER.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\nRichard was amongst the first guests to arrive for Catherine's party at Jackson's penthouse. Alex shared an article from [[Kimberly Thompson]] about her experience with Maggie, which focused on she advocated for herself to convince Maggie to operate. While Richard found the article moving, Maggie hated Kiki for telling her story and making it seem like she healed herself with her magical narcissism. Later, Richard overheard Owen complaining about Tom taking advantage of Teddy and told him that Tom had been after Catherine, too. Richard later caught Meredith and Andrew making out in the guest room and quickly left. Maggie later heard him talking about the article and told him to stop because it made her feel small and insignificant and it pissed her off. Richard talked about being bullied as the only black resident in his class and how it made him realize there's no point in being pissed off unless you do something with it. He then advised Maggie to take back her story and tell it louder. When the party had to be evacuated because of a supposed fire, Richard, Catherine, Jackson, and Maggie got in the limo and celebrated with burgers, champagne, and cider for Richard. Maggie had decided to follow Richard's advice. Catherine liked them being together and said they'd celebrate every scan together like this, no matter the outcome.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Maggie guested on a medical podcast, she accidentally let slip that Ellis Grey was her mother. The news of her biological parents spread in the medical community and Richard was asked for a comment. He lashed out at Maggie for not thinking about the consequences when she revealed his affair to the world. She later found him and he told her it was her story to tell, but he just hated that Catherine had to deal with it on top of everything else. He said he was not particularly proud of that story. She was hurt and told him that the story culminated in her existence. He later found her and said he was proud of her despite the shame about the circumstances of how she was conceived. She knew she was a scandal. Richard told her she was the best of him, Ellis, and her parents who raised her beautifully and that he was proud to be any part of her. That was what he would tell the press if they reached out for any more comment.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Richard found out that Jackson had the interns de-scale tilapia for his spray-on skin project, he gathered the fish and hosted a fish fry on the hospital roof.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> Catherine decided not to go back to work any time soon, but she wouldn't elaborate as to why only telling Richard \"cancer card.\" When Jackson and Richard treated [[Toby Donnelly]] together, Richard had troubles using the right pronouns since they were gender non-binary. He admitted it was hard to keep up with the world, but he just needed some guidance and patience to adjust. With the help from Taryn and Jackson, he got the hang of the pronouns.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nOn the heels of Andrew and Meredith making their relationship public, Richard scheduled a lap appy for Andrew. Andrew examined the patient, who complimented him on his looks in front of Richard. She then asked Andrew to check out her Instagram. Richard told him it was part of the job so Andrew complied and listened to the patient talk about Crossfit. In surgery, Richard asked about the long-term plan. Andrew thought he was talking about his relationship with Meredith and said they hadn't discussed it yet. He said he respected where Meredith came from and that she was amazing to him. Richard then said he meant Andrew's career. Andrew said he was attracted to general surgery. The surgery had to be converted to an open procedure when they came across dead bowel. Richard wanted to take over, but Andrew knew the steps of an ileocecectomy and pulled it off. Once Andrew was done, Richard complimented Andrew and said he'd put in a good word with the head of general surgery. He ran into Meredith after and told her that Andrew did well and that he was a good man, subtly giving her his blessing. He later went by Bailey's office because she had found out that Alex had been handing off paperwork to interns. They agreed it was a genius move but that he could never found out that they thought that. That night, Richard took Catherine for a stroll in the park to de-stress after she completed a complicated transplant surgery as her first surgery back.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard made peace with his AA acquaintance.]]\nWhen an AA acquaintance of Richard's was admitted to the hospital with a heel impaling her chest, Richard kept showing up to provide support against Gemma's wishes. Ollie was Gemma's sponsor, too, but unlike Richard, she didn't have a family to fall back on after Ollie's death. She started drinking again and fell down the stairs while carrying her heels after a night out. While she didn't want him on the case and even had Maggie throw him out of the room, he showed up in the scrub room to talk to Maggie. He told her that while maybe he didn't resort to drinking, Ollie's death made him an angry dry drunk and if he hadn't had a lot of money to settle with that bar, he would have been in prison by now. Maggie was then paged , so Richard had to take over from her. The surgery went well and Richard admitted to Gemma that he was the one who had operated on her. She let it slide and they laughed about what had happened to her. She wanted her  years back. He told her to focus on today instead of the number of years and shared the story of how he almost lost his  years not too long ago.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\n\nOne day at work, Richard noticed that \"Ellis Shepherd\" was scheduled for an ex lap. Richard rushed to the scrub room and found out that Meredith had put her daughter's name down so an immigrant's daughter could benefit from her insurance since the man earned too much to qualify for the state coverage but too little to pay for the surgery himself. Meredith refused to ship the kid off to County because she needed Alex Karev-level care after being separated from her parents for months at the border. Richard acknowledged the system was wrong but that she had chosen the wrong way to attempt to fix it. In surgery, they found out that the girl's obstruction was caused by lymphoma, meaning her case would drag on after this surgery. After the surgery, Richard yelled at her because his AA program required rigorous honesty in all his affairs, so keeping this secret was threatening his sobriety. He pointed out she could lose her license or her kids if she were sent to jail as well as the fact that implicating [[Luis Rivera]] in insurance fraud wouldn't help with his asylum. Richard then come up with a plan to make [[Gabriella Rivera]] sicker on paper so they could keep her there for  days, which would automatically activate a new state policy regardless of income.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Catherine surprised Richard when she showed up at the hospital. She had to come down there for Foundation business. She and Bailey locked themselves in a conference room with people in suits would divulging the reason behind the meetings. Richard grew increasingly worried while wild rumors about the meeting started to spread. Richard scrubbed in to repair a punctured rectum. In surgery, he taught [[Nico Kim]] that you need to find humor in the job in order to be able to survive in it.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nAfter surgery, Richard saw Andrew being escorted away in handcuffs by the police. Andrew told him he had committed fraud and Bailey filled him in on the details. She asked Richard to come to the ER with her for incoming casualties, but he wandered off. He found Meredith stuck in the hyperbaric chamber with Alex and [[Gus Carter]]. She asked him to go set the record straight, but he didn't want to land her in jail and leave her kids without their mother. As Gus started coding, Richard ordered the techs to decompress the chamber. \n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Richard is fired along with Alex and Meredith for covering up the latter's insurance fraud.]]\nRichard and Bailey operated together and she told Richard she was suspecting that Andrew did not do it alone and that he was just covering for Meredith. She asked if he knew anything about that, but Richard dodged the question. After surgery, Richard found Alex asked him to come. They interrupted Meredith's meeting with Catherine and Bailey and defended her actions, stating that they knew but had failed to report it. They just couldn't put that father through more misery. Bailey then decided to fire all three of them.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nRichard took to an AA meeting to vent his anger over his mentee firing him while his wife sat back and did nothing, predicting he wouldn't be able to forgive them any time soon. He got a job working for a health app, which required him to make house calls for minor illnesses, providing him with excuses to avoid Catherine at home. He soon quit and interviewed for the Chief of Surgery position at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]], the lowest-ranked hospital in Seattle. He was offended when the interviewer bluntly asked if he wasn't planning on retiring any time soon since the job was enormous and they were looking for somebody in the long run, as they wanted to overturn the facility to improve its ranking. After a week, he went to check if they had called Alex, whom he had put down as a reference. Alex didn't know since he never answers calls of unknown numbers. Noticing Alex had let his life fall apart, Richard suggested he interview for the job and then hire him as an attending. While initially hesitant, Alex was convinced when Richard pointed out he needed to get his life back in order to give Jo a reason to come back. Alex was hired and he hired Richard. Catherine found out and angrily confronted him, saying his working there humiliated her and her Foundation. He shot back that she just let him be fired and went to sleep on the couch.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOn his first day at Pac-North, Richard discovered the hospital only had two residents, both of whom were terrible doctors because they were too swamped with scut to hone their mediocre skills. He went to complain to Alex about it and to demand an office. Alex reminded him of the hospital's terrible ranking and that they were supposed to turn it around. Throughout the day, Richard was confronted with how terrible the hospital was compared to Grey Sloan, like a malfunctioning CT and a crowded ER with personnel that paged him for non-surgical cases. During an emergency surgery with Alex, Richard told him he didn't want to work there after having worked at Grey Sloan for  years. He figured he'd drop dead one day in OR , a thought that made him happy. They managed to save the patient, which was about the only thing that went right that day. Afterward, Alex admitted he also had had his doubts about Pac-North but he had become invested to change things around so that failure was no longer the culture there. He made Richard see he could help him do that and find a new legacy for himself in doing so, which would also prove Bailey wrong. Alex had also arranged for a janitorial closet to be turned into Richard's office.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nAlex and Richard started changing things for the better with baby steps, like a new MRI machine. While Catherine was away for Foundation business, Richard found out that his calls had landed [[Gemma Larson]] a job in the billing department of Pac-North. Richard had a brain dead patient whose sisters needed to decide if they wanted him to pull the plug. Since the sisters had drifted apart, they kept arguing, which prevented them from making a decision. Richard broke up the fighting and told them to come together for the decision so that their sister's death would mean something for their sisterhood. They decided to pull the plug. However, after Richard did that, the patient's phone rang and they discovered that the woman they had just unplugged had stolen her bag, meaning Richard had unplugged a random woman. Richard informed Alex and told the sisters to use this opportunity to forgive one another and reconnect with each other and their third sister. He informed Alex and then left him to clean up the mess. He tried calling Catherine but she didn't answer. He then ran into Gemma, who had heard about what had happened and asked him for details over dinner. He agreed and they left together.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nWith the basics at the hospital set straight, Richard and Alex started to have time to teach the two residents. Richard was upset when he discovered the article that had come out in Meredith's name trashing Grey Sloan, a sentiment not shared by Alex. Richard let [[Cecil Taylor]] scrub in with him to operate on [[Yan Huang]], who had refused to be treated at Grey Sloan because of Meredith's trending article.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nWhile on his way out after an all-night surgery, Richard ran into Gemma, who insisted on buying him breakfast with her paycheck. He conceded and they left together. Over breakfast, they briefly talked about her unsuccessful search for a new sponsor and work until she steered the conversation towards his marriage. He talked about their recent fight, how the passionate light in Catherine seemed to have gone out, and how he didn't know how to get it back. He talked about how, as a -year-old boy, he feared his father wouldn't have his love sitting next to him on his porch for the rest of his life when his mother died. Gemma told him she was the opposite and always wanted a rotation of men rather than marriage. Richard said he had never been that. She proceeded to touch his hand meaningfully. He pulled back and she questioned why he pulled away from the first little bit of comfort he'd had in weeks. He cited his marriage as the reason. She said she was thinking that because he and Catherine had hit the \"worse\" part of their vows, he may be looking around. She had no intention of competing with Catherine but she didn't think he should be miserable until they found their way back to one another. She explicitly stated she was here and that life was too short to deprive themselves of what they had been feeling for so many years. Richard told her she had mistaken her friendship for something else. He apologized if he had done anything to mislead her but stated there was nothing between them, nor would there ever be. She reminded him that when hard times hit, he had a habit of burying himself in either another woman or a bottle of vodka, only one of which he could properly handle. He went to grab his coat and she surprised him with a kiss. He pushed her off of him and left. She followed him, thinking he was just lying about not being attracted to her. He told her he was in love with his wife. Gemma threw his tumultuous love life in his face. Richard refused to let her use his history to make herself less lonely and pointed out she was in dire need of a sponsor.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, Richard helped Alex to lead a group of investors around the hospital. They tried to distract them from a chaotic ER and failing residents. Richard learned from Alex that the construction workers had discovered a mass grave on the construction site of the new research wing. They decided not to tell the investors and Richard continued the tour by himself to let Alex handle the administrative side. He managed to keep the investors busy the entire day only to walk in and have them overhear Alex while he was loudly announcing his handling of the mass grave to keep gossiping nurses in check.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Richard began ignoring Gemma. When she confronted him about it, he turned down her offer to let her make up for her behavior over coffee. He was surprised when Maggie showed up at Pac-North with his brother [[Chris Webber]] and niece [[Sabrina Webber|Sabi Webber]], whom he hadn't seen in five years. Sabi then revealed to Richard and Maggie that she had a large cardiac tumor. While Sabi had a new scan taken, Richard explained to Maggie that he had left his family behind because they thought he deemed himself better than them, and he wanted to protect Maggie from their hostile behavior. The scan then revealed that the tumor had grown considerably and invade its surroundings. Maggie wanted to operate but Sabi did not want to be operated on by family. While Maggie didn't see how that applied as they had only known each other for a few hours, Richard sided with Sabi and paged the on-call cardiac surgeon from Pac-North, which angered Maggie. She did agree to consult with the surgeon, though. However, as Sabi's condition grew dire quickly, Richard honestly said he wanted Maggie to operate, which convinced Sabi to consent. When Chris left the waiting room to go call family, Gemma came to sit with Richard. He told her part of the conflict with his family consisted of his brother blaming his alcoholism on his ambition, which bothered him. As Gemma put a reassuring hand on Richard's shoulder, Catherine arrived. Gemma quickly left. Richard was surprised to see Catherine, who said she had to come as it was a family matter. He and Chris then reminisced about Sabi as a child. Privately, Richard explained Gemma's presence to Catherine, who took it as an admission of guilt. Soon after, Alex and Maggie delivered the bad news that Sabi had died on the table. Chris exploded in rage and yelled at Maggie. Catherine tried to defuse the situation and took Richard and his brother to go say goodbye to Sabi.<ref>[[Papa Don't Preach]], x</ref>\n\nRichard isolated himself from his loved ones. He attended Sabi's funeral without Catherine, Maggie, and Jackson as his family wasn't ready to see them. He arrived back in town the night before Meredith's trial with the medical board. At the hotel, he apologized to Jackson for not having reached out while in Boston and he snapped at Bailey, who commented on the amount of people that had taken time off work to come support Meredith. Richard followed the entire hearing and was called to the stand. The tampered-with Alzheimer's trial was brought up and Richard again took all the blame, frustrating Bailey. [[Patricia Murphy]] revealed in her testimony that Richard made a call to the NRMP to get Meredith a spot at Seattle Grace, displaying his habit of bending the rules in her favor. During the break, Bailey confronted him with his lying for Meredith, enabling her in her behavior rather than setting her straight. He said his taking the fall for her was his choice and that he only wrote a recommendation for her. Bailey pointed out he always went around the system for Meredith, regardless of the consequences, which Richard pointed out was her being jealous. He admitted to giving her special treatment due to his history with Ellis, which made him think of Meredith as family, which had made him willing to do the things he did. Bailey then vented her frustrations over the consequences she had faced because of their insurance fraud. She felt betrayed by someone she raised. He said he recognized that feeling from when she had torpedoed Meredith's character with her cold testimony. He thought Bailey would stick out her neck for Meredith like he had done. The trial then resumed and ended with Meredith getting to keep her license.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nGemma continued to look after Richard at work. Owen witnessed their close interaction but Richard assured him Gemma was just a friend. Gemma came by his office later where they talked about Sabi and Richard's fight with Catherine. Gemma brought up her husband's death, which made her start drinking. As they went to say a prayer together, [[Zander Perez]] briefly came in to complain about a procedure, believing Gemma to be Richard's wife, but Richard sent him away to go do his job. After Richard witnessed some flirty interactions between Owen and Daphne Lopez, a prospective ER doctor, he warned Owen that he was going down a slippery slope. When Owen said he was taken, Richard pointed out he hadn't yet proposed to Teddy and wondered what he was waiting for. That evening, as he was leaving with Gemma, Richard received a text from Catherine saying that she had left town for business. However, he didn't even know she had been in Seattle. He then told Gemma that Catherine was thinking that there was something going on between him and Gemma.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a car crashed into Joe's bar, Meredith called in Richard and Owen to help out at Grey Sloan as multiple residents had been injured. Bailey granted them privileges and Richard took on the case of [[Taryn Helm]]. Privately, Ben asked Richard to keep an eye out on Bailey as she wasn't giving herself time to process her recent miscarriage. Richard cautiously tried to let Bailey know that Ben had told him what was going on but she kept the conversation about work. However, during surgery, she couldn't bring herself to crack open Taryn's chest. Richard took over and they managed to save her life. Afterward, the two of them lingered in the OR and he told her all the residents had been saved. Finally having the time to let herself feel the grief, she broke down in Richard's arms. Richard later went to fetch Meredith and they dropped by Bailey's office with tissues and doughnuts to comfort her.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nUpon hearing Maggie had quit her job after Sabi's death and that Chris was suing her, he took a day off and went to see her at home. He wanted to take her out to go eat something but given her appearance, he thought it was better to eat in. As he was looking for food to make her breakfast, she told him she didn't deserve compassion from him. Since there was no food at the house, he said they would start with coffee while she insisted that she wanted to be alone. Over coffee, Richard told Maggie that she was Sabi's only shot. He told Maggie he hadn't been able to look at her because he sent her into that OR knowing Sabi was unlikely to survive. Maggie said it was all her fault as she had forgotten to ask about Sabi's clotting time, which she was used to being told by the OR staff at Grey Sloan. It had made her question her aptitude. She then begged Richard to leave. He left but soon returned with food. Maggie asked Richard to yell at her, knowing he had lost way more than her. Richard remained calm and shared with her the lesson that his mother had taught him: talk about your problems over pancakes. He made pancakes and as they were eating, he went over Sabi's case to find what he could have done better. Maggie insisted it was not his fault. Richard then told her she was just imperfect and human, which nobody had ever had to tell her before. Richard then advised her to let insurance settle with Chris to give him the sense that something came of Sabi's death. He stressed that Maggie was too skilled to quit and that Sabi wouldn't want that. Maggie wished she had gotten to know Sabi better so Richard invited her to ask him everything she wanted to know about her. That night at home, he found Catherine waiting for him. She had found out he hadn't shown up for work all day. He said he was trying to convince Maggie to go back to work but she questioned how that could  take all day. Richard pointed out things wouldn't work if she didn't trust him. She agreed and said she wasn't sure if things were working.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nRichard and Catherine talked it over and agreed to get a divorce. They planned on telling their children over dinner, which Richard found too much, but Catherine insisted. Maggie arrived first, figuring it was a dinner party for their anniversary. As soon as Jackson arrived, Richard wanted to get to the point but Catherine interrupted by handing out wine as she wanted to wait until after dinner. Unbeknownst to the hosts, Jackson had invited Vic, who brought Dean to set him up with Maggie. Catherine took Richard to the kitchen and said she didn't want to tell their children with all the extra people. They agreed to get through the night without letting Jackson and Maggie know. Over dinner, Catherine dissed Pac-North to hurt Richard. To defuse the tension, Dean asked Catherine and Richard how they met. Jackson and Maggie told their story, including their proposal. Jackson then made a toast to their perfect marriage. While preparing dessert, Catherine admitted she had forgotten about the proposal story and it had made her realize that they always managed to find a way through the bad times. She asked him not to give up yet. He asked her to apologize first for not showing him loyalty and turning her back on him when he had to rebuild his entire life. She couldn't bring herself to truly apologize, causing Richard to declare that it was too late for their marriage to be saved.\n\nOver dessert, Richard started texting. Catherine openly accused him of cheating on her with Gemma. Richard revealed he had actually been in touch with Alex to approve an offer to hire Maggie at Pac-North. Jackson made a snide comment. Having had enough with all the tension, Catherine finally blurted out that she and Richard were getting a divorce. Richard apologized to the children for them having to find out this way. He went out to get some air, where Maggie came to sit with him. He told her it was truly over with Catherine. She comforted him and accepted the job offer. Once the guests were gone, he went inside to pack for a hotel but Catherine already called her driver. He told Catherine that Maggie had accepted his offer, which only infuriated Catherine more. She said that she was embarrassed for him throwing his career away and now dragging Maggie down with him. He knew that she hated how Maggie would put their hospital on the map and it would be out of Catherine's control. As he stressed that he was now free to do as he pleased, she pulled out his phone and made a call to her finance guy to look into buying Pac-North. She casually said she could shut it down. She told him she wasn't sorry about a damn thing and headed out the door.<ref>[[The Last Supper]], x</ref>\n\nOn Monday, Richard told Owen that Catherine had bought the hospital after a fight. She made them go over to Grey Sloan and interview with Tom, who would decide if they would be hired at Grey Sloan. Tom called in Richard first and told him his job was safe, as Catherine requested. Richard was angry about Catherine playing him like a piece of chess and turned the offer down. Richard left to go to a meeting but couldn't bring himself to go the empty house afterward. Jackson found Richard on a bench outside the hospital in the evening. Jackson thought it would all blow over soon but Richard wasn't too sure about that. Jackson then gathered Bailey, Meredith, and Owen and the five of them met with Tom. They told him they were prepared to quit en masse, which would piss Catherine off, unless he agreed to their terms. Part of the deal was that Richard would be re-hired. Tom was forced to agree to their ultimatum.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nTo distract Richard from his marriage falling apart, Bailey had him train the new residents who had been hired from Pac-North. She also invited him to dinner but he didn't appreciate her fussing over him. All day, Richard was distracted while the residents practiced in the skills lab. After Bailey heard that Richard had dismissed the residents before  P.M., she found him sitting outside. He told her he didn't want her checking up on him. He added that having those subpar residents at Grey Sloan felt like a punishment, like Catherine had won. Bailey expressed worry after he told her he was bone tired, cautiously suggesting he was suffering from depression. He told her he would be okay and left.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nDuring a skills lab, a resident named Tess Desmond asked Richard why he was still practicing despite his immense amount of experience. He replied that practice was the key to experience. After Tess said she didn't understand why the other residents weren't taking their job more seriously after everything they had been through to get there, Richard invited her to practice her laparoscopic skills with him. After Tess calmly reassured a patient during rounds, Richard invited her to scrub in with him. As they were scrubbing in, she listed all the steps to the procedure and Richard said he would allow her to perform the procedure, much to her astonishment. However, before she made the first cut, Levi came barging in and announced that Tess was actually his patient, [[Tess Anderson]]. She was taken back to her room, where she explained that she had had to let go of her dream of becoming a surgeon after going through four types of cancer in eight years drained her college funds. She just wanted to live her dream for one day. Richard then performed the procedure with Taryn after all. He visited Tess afterward and said his dream of becoming a surgeon was harder than it was for others, too, but he stuck with it. He then revealed he had developed a tremor in his hands, preventing him from operating again, as would any treatment for it. In an attempt to inspire her not to give up on chasing the most beautiful job in the world, he gave her his stethoscope, saying he wouldn't need it anymore.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nOne morning, Richard received a letter from Alex, which he took with him to an AA meeting. He quickly read it and angrily threw it away. During the meeting, he spoke about the rush of being a surgeon and training young minds. He said a student he wouldn't have put money on at first stepped up and became a stellar surgeon and a fine teacher. Said student informed him through a letter that he would abandoned his entire life to be a father to the two children he apparently had with his ex-wife, whom he now loved again. Richard wanted to yell at him for making that mistake but having fallen in love with two women at the same time before and having missed his own child growing up, he knew Alex had to follow his heart and gut. Richard admitted he mostly felt robbed of the chance to say goodbye, even more so after they had begun to turn Pac-North around. He concluded that lately, all his loved ones were disappearing and he couldn't find a way to make it stop. As he finished his talk, his hand was shaking again.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Richard handed off his entire service, only teaching skills lab anymore. Soon after, Richard found movers moving his furniture from Pac-North into his office at Grey Sloan. He demanded they take the furniture back, much to Bailey's surprise. Richard left to teach a skills lab. Afterward, Bailey took him back to his office and showed him she arranged for his old furniture from before his firing to be moved into place. However, he got angry again for her assuming that that is what he wanted. In a hissy fit, he declined her offer to call building services and started throwing things onto the floor. At the end of the day, Bailey found Richard sitting in his empty office and brought up his handing off his service. He admitted the smallest thing set him off these days and apologized for his outburst. He told her he was stepping back from surgery, which is why he didn't want to use this office anymore. It reminded him of another time, another him, and it cluttered his mind. He held his hand to stop it from shaking while he said he wanted to look ahead. Bailey said the hospital needed him. He simply said he wanted to step away while at the top of his game.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn [[Pro Bono Surgery Day|pro bono surgery day]], Maggie let Richard know that she had settled with [[Chris Webber|Chris]] like Richard had advised her to. Richard then shared that Catherine had sent over divorce papers. She let him keep his own house. Meredith then came up and tried to talk him into joining the pro bono surgical team but he turned her down. Jackson later ran into him and asked about his day. Richard just said he had nothing and walked off. At night, Jackson invited Richard to the game that night to show him that he wasn't picking sides in the divorce. Richard happily accepted.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nRichard traveled to Los Angeles to present his PathPen at the LA Surgical Innovation Conference. He called Maggie \"Meredith\" upon meeting her in the lobby but blamed it on the flight. He had rewritten his talk  times and was eager to share his Pen with the world. As he was working on his speech by himself in his room, he was surprised when Catherine showed up at his door with an apology for her behavior. He then admitted Gemma had kissed him. They then laughed about their expensive fight and lied down on the bed. The next morning, he ordered breakfast for her. He was vigorously working on his speech by the time she woke up, rambling on about a luminous insight into cancer. He kept going on as she encouraged him. Unaware that he had been talking to a hallucination the entire time, he declared he was finished and recited his talk to her, working in a joke per her advice. Later that day, he took the stage with many of his colleagues watching the livestream from home. After a charming introduction, he announced that he wasn't going to talk about his Pen and declared that with his brilliant wife's help, he had found a way to cure cancer, alarming his loved ones, including Catherine back in Seattle, who assumed he was drunk. He then started his chaotic, nonsensical talk about cells and cancer and went through slides of hand-drawn pictures of organs and atomic explosions, stating that cells need apologies. A slide showed Catherine's name written in a heart. As he went on, Teddy called for help while Maggie and Cormac got on the stage and told him that he wasn't feeling well. Not recognizing her, he tried to keep going and got a little aggressive. Maggie and Cormac escorted him off the stage and got him on a gurney. As he was taken away, he suddenly recognized Maggie again and asked her what was happening, while it dawned on him he had been hallucinating the entire night.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine boarded her private plane to Los Angeles to go pick up Richard and Maggie. While flying back to Seattle, Maggie found memes online mocking Richard. Catherine's publicist got to work trying to minimize the damage. While the attendings gathered in a war room to find the diagnosis, Richard got settled in a room, again not realizing something was wrong. Catherine played along with her being at the conference and claimed he got sick after his presentation, which is why they were running the test. While they performed a PET scan, Richard cited all steps of a Whipple procedure to prove that he wasn't losing his mind. The scan showed no signs of Alzheimer's or Lewy Body dementia. Andrew paid Richard a visit in his room, pretending it was a social visit, even though he was in contact with [[Lauren Riley]]. Maggie and Meredith later performed some cognitive testing, which he failed miserably. They brushed it off as his being tired to keep him calm. Later, Richard disappeared from his room. His loved ones spread out to find him. Meredith found him in a dark OR about to cut himself open for an ex-lap, stating he was the only one who could fix this. Meredith cautiously approached and assured him that she could fix him, too, as he was the one who had taught her everything she knows. She wanted her children to grow up and know him. She wasn't ready to let him go yet, and neither were other people. He handed over the scalpel. He called her Ellis and said something was wrong with him. She guided him back to his room. He thought he was at Seattle Grace and asked for his interns so they could start rounding. He also said Adele would kill him if he was late for dinner again. Unable to bear watching his decline, Catherine left the room while Meredith and Maggie got Richard comfortable.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nCatherine continued to watch over him even though he did not recognize her, his cognitive function rapidly declining even further to the point of him being minimally responsive. After a few weeks, Catherine wanted to take Richard home despite his doctors' protest. As they tried to get him in a wheelchair, which angered him, he revealed he had numb extremities. The EMG showed impaired nerve function, which wasn't consistent with the tentative diagnosis of dementia. They then went to do a nerve biopsy but Andrew interrupted the procedure, thinking he had found he diagnosis: cobalt poisoning from his hip replacement three years ago. As cobalt wasn't included in the standard heavy metal panel, Meredith drew another blood sample, which confirmed the diagnosis. Link operated and replaced the hip, removing the toxic sludge from his body. Richard woke up in the ICU after a while with Maggie by his side. He recognized her and answered some questions correctly. His tremor was also gone. Catherine then came in and said she was having nurses bring her a bed so she could spend the night. However, he didn't want her there as he perfectly remembered her not standing by him as he got fired and her buying his hospital just to spite him. He ordered her to get out.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nRichard is a determined teacher and boss who cares a lot for his personnel and the hospital itself.\n\nHis private life is devoted to his professional one. Without his job, he doesn't have a real reason to live, especially after his wife,\ua[[Adele Webber]], died. He was a loving husband towards her, despite the fact that he cheated on her and put his duties in the hospital above everything.\n\nHe has always cared for\ua[[Meredith Grey]]\uaas if he was her father. He decided to mentor her personally to make sure she became a great general surgeon.\ua\n\n\n\n[[Ellis Grey]]\n[[File:xEllisRichardFlashback.jpg|thumb|left|px|Richard leaves Ellis.]]Richard met [[Ellis Grey]] when [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] was three. During their residency at Seattle Grace, he had an affair with her, although both were married. Although Ellis left her husband, Richard could not bring himself to leave his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]]. He would learn decades later, however, that Adele had known about the affair all along and stayed with him anyway. He later confessed that he ended the affair because he believed that Ellis deserved better and that he had too much baggage.\n\nWhen Dr. [[Maggie Pierce]] began to work at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], she told Richard that she was adopted and [[Ellis Grey]] was her birth mom, leaving Richard to suspect that he is her biological father.\n\n[[Adele Webber]]\nRichard proposed to Adele on New Year's and got married the Valentine's Day after. They got married when Adele was .\n\nAdele asked him to retire, forcing him to choose between his career or their marriage. He tried to skirt around it, but Adele, tired of waiting, made her choice\uaand left him. He moved out and was sleeping in his office for a short time, but later had a room at the same hotel as [[Callie Torres|Callie]]. After learning of Ellis's illness, Richard had been visiting her regularly, but upon deciding to attempt a reconciliation with Adele realized that he could no longer continue his emotional affair with Ellis. He attempted\uato patch things up with his wife but was stunned to find out that she had\uaapparently moved on to someone else.\n\nAdele was admitted to the hospital and was discovered, first by Addison and later by Richard, to be pregnant (at  years old). Though he believed the father to be the man Adele insinuated to be seeing months earlier, Richard stayed by Adele's side as she was treated, though complications later arose and she lost the baby. Adele later admitted to Richard that the baby, which was a boy, was actually his. After this tragedy, Richard and Adele decided to give their marriage another try.\n\nRichard and Adele declared that his work was the reason that their marriage had failed. He started living on Derek's property in his own trailer and began to repair his life as a divorc\ue.\n\nAfter months living apart, Richard decided to move back home. He admitted to Adele that he made a mistake  years ago but he's a good man, and he doesn't treat her as she deserves, putting his foot down. Adele commented, \"It's about time\" and allowed Richard to return home.<ref>[[Freedom, Part ]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Adele moves into Roseridge.|xpx]]\n\nAfter Adele was placed in [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]] after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and finding a new love, [[Allan]], Richard began to date [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]].\n\nAdele later passed away of a heart attack on the day of [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey's]] wedding.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\n[[Catherine Fox]]\nRichard and Catherine maintained a\uaflirtatious relationship throughout her first two visits to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital|Seattle Grace Mercy West]]. He almost accompanied her to a medical ball, but he realized he needed to be with his\ua[[Adele Webber|wife]] in her time of need. By the time of the medical boards, Adele's condition had\uadeteriorated to the point she did not recognize Richard anymore and had begun \"dating\" another man. This was when Catherine and Richard began their sexual relationship. When Adele died, Richard pushed away Catherine and her efforts at a relationship. They have since reconciled and see each other on an irregular basis, but are serious. Richard was planning on proposing to Catherine, but a huge argument about Cristina losing the Harper Avery Award changed his mind. After some time apart, Richard professed his feelings for Catherine and subsequently, they reconciled. Richard and Catherine later showed differing views on marriage just as he was about to propose to her again. Some time later, Catherine proposed to Richard in front of the whole hospital, to which he agreed.\n\nThey faced difficulties in their marriage after Richard was fired, as he said that she had just sat there and let him be fired. He began to work at Pac-North, which upset Catherine. They eventually decided to separate, and at a dinner where they were supposed to break the news to Jackson and Maggie, they had another argument. This ended in Catherine purchasing Pac-North. Richard first refused to be hired back to Grey Sloan because of what happened with Catherine, but he eventually came back.\ua\n\nDuring his cobalt poisoning, Catherine stayed by his side, as he didn't remember what she had done. After Richard was cured, he demanded that she leave.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nRichard attended both of Bailey's weddings. In , Miranda became an intern at\ua[[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Richard discovered her talent when she correctly diagnosed a patient after  months of unnecessary surgeries.\ua\n\nWhen he was a drunk, she was the only one that managed to make him admit it and sign the papers to go into rehab instead of signing the papers for early retirement.\n\nHe was the one who recommended\uathat she be the new board member after Cristina's departure, and he also recommended her to be chief when [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] stepped down. \n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nRichard and Derek were good friends. They first met during Derek's residency when Richard was one of his teachers. When Richard separated from [[Adele Webber|his wife]], Derek allowed Richard to park his trailer on his land and live there.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[File:RichardandMeredithForgiveEachOther.jpg|thumb|left|Richard and Meredith forgiving each other|xpx]]Richard and Meredith share a father-daughter-esque relationship. He met her during his residency when Meredith was a little girl. In the recent past, after Meredith started her surgical residency, the relationship between the two of them was a rocky one. For quite some time, Meredith couldn't forgive Richard that he had forced her parents apart and acted unprofessionally and disrespectfully towards him. Also, Richard couldn't forgive himself for not standing up for her and never doing anything about the fact that Ellis was neglecting her. Also, he couldn't detach the feelings he had for Meredith's mother,\ua[[Ellis Grey]], from the feelings he had for her. After an intervention by [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]], they forgave each other.\n\nAfter a gunman, by the name of [[Gary Clark]] entered the hospital and started shooting people, Meredith offered herself to him, stating that she was the closest thing to a daughter Richard had.\n\nAfter the shooting, they maintained a good relationship until his accident during [[Super Storm|the super storm]]. In the aftermath of this accident, Meredith learned that she was Richard's healthcare proxy and that his life depended on her decisions. Meredith made the decision to have them operate and he woke up from his coma. After waking up, Richard told Meredith that he had only made her his medical proxy because he thought she had the guts to let him die. This revelation estranged them for a while, but subsequently, Richard apologized and they both returned to a close relationship.\n\n\nHe was the [[Chief of Surgery]] at Seattle Grace and was formerly a mentor to [[Derek Shepherd]] and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] during their residency.\n\nThere are continuity errors regarding where exactly Richard built his career; at one point, he states that with the exception of his fellowship, he spent his entire career at Seattle Grace. However, it is also established that he both taught and befriended Addison and Derek, presumably in New York (the majority of references within the show, as well as additional sources, indicate that a good portion of Richard's career was spent in Manhattan, rather than Seattle). He also has a diploma from Northwestern University. \n\nA board member regards Richard as the best surgeon in the hospital and is demonstrated on the occasion in the robotics lab where he takes the course as a \"refresher\", and he pits himself against [[Cristina Yang]], losing in the first few tasks. In the last task, performing a minor operation, Richard manages to complete the surgery with his eyes closed, while Cristina struggles to get ahead. When asked how he managed to do so, he claims muscle memory - he is so used to these procedures knows how to perform the surgery with his eyes closed.\n\nRichard had planned to retire and recommended [[Preston Burke]] as his successor, but after the secret of Burke's tremor and cover-up came out, that plan was put to a stand-still. Nevertheless, he has told the hospital board of his retirement and has yet to name his successor; Derek, Preston, Addison, and Mark all eagerly clamoring for the post. Richard eventually chose Derek, but Derek tells him that Richard should remain chief.\n\nIn an attempt to move back home, Richard begins to delegate some of his work to other staff with responsibilities, such as the [[Resident#Chief Resident|chief resident]], at the time being [[Callie Torres]], but as she was slightly unaware of what to do exactly, [[Miranda Bailey]] eventually replaces her, reducing Richard's burden. To assist with this further, he enlists\ua [[George O'Malley]] to become the chief's intern to assist with some of his day to day duties, such as passing messages, phone calls, charting, pre-op and post-op patients amongst other things, until George finally had enough after learning he failed his intern exam by  point.\n\nAfter the death of O'Malley and throughout the merger with Mercy West, Richard comes under a massive amount of stress. He makes a mistake on a patient that brings to the attention of Bailey that something is wrong. Eventually, he takes Meredith under his tutelage where she finally figures out that he had started to drink again. Meredith eventually tells Derek and Derek brings it to the attention of the board who force Richard to resign as chief and his responsibilities as a doctor; Derek takes over his position as chief of surgery.\n\nAfter a numerous number of days sober, Richard finally returns to being a [[General Surgery|general surgery]] [[Attending|attending]] under Shepherd. He is the doctor that was on the case of [[Gary Clark]]'s wife and did her surgery. She did not recover however and died leaving Clark with a vendetta against him. Clark later returns and begins to shoot people, mainly surgeons, in the hospital. Webber was not present at the time but once he hears what is going on he finds a way into the hospital and confronts Clark, who ultimately commits suicide.\n\nDerek resigns as chief surgeon, leaving Richard as interim chief until the board agrees to let him come back full-time as the chief of surgery. After a day of recalling his old procedures with [[Ellis Grey]], he began going through her journals again. When he found the trick he was looking for, Richard was encouraged to try to expand her findings on islet cell transplantation, which was stopped because of her Alzheimer's. He initiated a clinical trial to cure type  diabetes through a device that contains insulin-producing islet cells. He even tried to get Meredith to participate, which she ultimately turned down because she was dedicated to Derek's Alzheimer's trial.\n\nBefore he could get the approval or a waiver from the FDA, Richard tried the device and procedure on Clara Greene, who was in a hypoglycemic coma. Eventually, it was approved. Richard, with [[Jackson Avery]] as his assistant, began trying out the \"artificial pancreas\" on humans, as well as mice.\n\nRichard took the fall for Meredith's tampering of a clinical trial for Alzheimer's which could help Adele. He resigned as Chief and helped [[Owen Hunt]] obtain the job as his successor. He has since been a senior general surgery attending. Richard passed the clinical trial onto Dr. Bailey.\n\nRichard invested money to buy\ua[[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]], which was later renamed\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. As Richard is a part-owner of [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], he has a seat on the board as a member.\ua\n\nAfter he had recovered from his accident, [[Owen Hunt]] made him [[Resident#Program Director|director of the residency program]].\n\nAfter Owen quit, Richard was named interim chief of surgery until they could replace him.\n\nBecause he didn't want to be the Chief anymore, he recommended Miranda Bailey for the job. She was judged up against a candidate chosen by Catherine Avery, [[Tracy McConnell]], and was ultimately named Chief of Surgery.\n\nAfter reviewing the residency records and finding several questionable calls, Catherine Avery made Bailey hire a new Director of the residency program, Dr. Eliza Minnick. This upset Richard, who believed Bailey had betrayed him. Eventually, he started to work alongside Minnick with the residents. This ended when after the hospital fire, Bailey fired Minnick, reinstating Richard in his function.\n\nBailey fired him upon discovering the role he played in covering up Meredith's insurance fraud. He initially got a job working for the health app Pronto Health Pro, but quit soon. He interviewed for the Chief of Surgery job at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]], the last ranked hospital of Seattle since its new investors were looking for someone with vision and experience to turn the place around. However, he wasn't hired because of his approaching retirement. He then made Alex interview and when he got the job, made him hire him as an attending general surgeon there.\n\n\n*He is a recovering alcoholic.\n*When he drinks, he drinks vodka.\n*He has driven several Mercedes Benz E-Class Models through the years\n*His favorite cake is red velvet with cream cheese icing.<ref>[[Hope for the Hopeless]], x</ref>\n*He claims to be strong at history and geography trivia.\n*In , Webber won a plaque for \"best doctors in America\".\n*His email address is [[rwebber@seattlegrace.com]].\n*He taught a painful lesson to Addison about getting to close to her patients by giving her a patient who would eventually die.

She eventually taught [[Izzie Stevens]] the same lesson.\n*During the first two episodes of [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|season one]], Richard has M.D., Ph.D., and [[Fellow of the American College of Surgeons|F.A.C.S]] on his lab coat, however, subsequent episodes only shows M.D. and F.A.C.S.

He was previously a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Shane's life before his internship. He does not tell anything about his early life.\n\n\nShane was one of the new interns brought into the program along with [[Jo Wilson]], [[Stephanie Edwards]], [[Leah Murphy]], and [[Heather Brooks]].\n\nWhen Cristina was in the hospital, he and Heather stood outside her hospital room and talked about her until she threw a vase at the window to scare them off.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\nHe was part of the group of interns who listened outside the on-call room while Bailey was in there with Ben.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nHe favored [[Neurosurgery]] and was constantly on [[Derek Shepherd|Derek Shepherd's]] service. When attending a skills lab taught by Derek on inserting central lines, he continuously interrupted the lecture to ask Derek about a chordoma Derek had removed in .<ref>[[I Saw Her Standing There]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Cristina came back from Minnesota, she dubbed him \"Happy\" and then \"Dopey.\" After working with her a little bit, he decided that he liked her.<ref>[[Second Opinion]], x</ref>\n\nWhen he cried when they had to deliver the news that he was dying to [[Graham Cunningham]], Cristina coached him not to get emotional in front of the patients.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n\nShane was excited to work in outpatient surgery with April despite the other interns' reluctance to work with April, whom they had deemed, \"The dud.\" After a day of working with her, he and the other interns were lined up to compete to scrub in on the surgery to fix Derek's hand. Employing skills taught to him by April, Shane talked to Derek as if he were any other patient and reassured him, landing himself a spot on the team.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Derek's surgery, he had to play ping pong for his rehab and Shane played with him. Shane initially let Derek win, but when Derek offered him the chance to scrub in on a surgery if he won, Shane stopped letting Derek win.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Derek disliked the posters of him all around the hospital, he assigned Shane to deface all of them.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Derek was told that he needed to work with interns other than Shane, [[Heather Brooks]] was assigned to his service. After being impressed by her reflexes, he told Shane that he needed to spend some time on other services so he could get a more rounded surgical education. He blamed Heather for the change and told her he wasn't going quietly.<ref>[[Can't Fight This Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nEven after being reassigned to another service, Shane continued to check in on Shepherd's patients. Derek confronted him about this, saying he needed to find the specialty where he could shine.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the super storm, he was left to close Meredith's abdomen after her c-section. However, there was excessive bleeding. Shane had to re-open her abdomen and find the bleeding. He located the bleed in her spleen. Meredith talked him through the procedure until she passed out and he was left to finish the surgery without her help. [[Heather Brooks]] had gone for help and brought back [[Miranda Bailey]], who still hadn't operated since her MRSA scare, and she finished the surgery.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\n\nEven after having worked all day night during the superstorm, Shane helped out in the ER when the victims of the mudslide were brought in. While coming back with supplies, he met with Derek, who asked him to page Heather for him so she could take his patient to have scans taken. Soon after, Bailey asked Shane to go look for Dr. Webber. He met Heather on her way to the ER and told her Derek asked her to find Webber. Heather listened to him and took off to the basement. Shane himself\uatook Derek's patient to radiology for the scans. However, Derek insisted Heather did further examinations, but she was nowhere to be found. Shane went looking for her, only to find her electrocuted in the basement. Heather and Richard were taken up and Shane scrubbed in with Derek to operate on Heather's subdural bleed. Derek thanked Shane for having found her in time. He stayed silent about the fact that he sent Heather to find Richard. In the beginning of the surgery, Shane was optimistic she would make it, but this changed when Derek had to perform a temporal lobectomy, which would cause memory and motor deficits but save her life in the end. Shane then blurted out it was his fault, but Derek, who didn't get it, insisted it wasn't, convincing Shane to hold it together and continue operating with him.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the surgery, Heather started crashing. Derek ordered Shane to get Owen as he started CPR, but when Shane returned with Owen, Derek had given up CPR. Shane ran to the hallway to get some fresh air, where Jackson asked him how Heather was doing. Feeling guilty, Shane didn't reply and ran off. The interns got the night off to mourn her death, while Derek ordered them to stay in the hospital and wait for Heather's mother to arrive. They tried to come up with Heather stories to tell her mother, but a guilty Shane stayed silent all day. When Maura Brooks arrived and received the bad news, the interns took her to the locker room to clear out Heather's locker. Maura noticed how devastated Shane was when he started crying. She hugged him and guessed he must've been close with her daughter. At the end of the day, a depressed Shane decided to ride out with the firefighters to the mudslide, with the other interns deciding to come with him. They noticed he was extremely upset by Heather's death and wanted to show support, as they were all he had.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nA week later, Shane worked on Richard's case and distanced himself from the other interns, who started learning for their intern exam. Richard was refusing a feeding tube and Bailey let him refuse it. Shane didn't agree with this and contacted Meredith about it. She told him to be proactive and order the tube already, which he did. Richard and Bailey found out and Richard ordered to get him some soup. Shane noticed how difficult it was for Richard to swallow it. As Bailey and Meredith went to take another look at Richard's swallow studies, Shane entered Richard's room and got ready to place the tube. He named what could happen if Richard kept on refusing the tube. Shane was determined to place the tube, as he wouldn't let another person die. Offering to place the tube now instead of Meredith having to do it herself, Shane placed the tube, saving Richard's life. He did what had to be done.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the interns began all sleeping at Alex's house and studying. Jo was waiting for Alex to proposition her so they could have sex and Alex was waiting because he thought she was still grieving, so he said they could stay there as long as they wanted. Jo went to the others and said that they needed to leave.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\nOn the night of the fundraising gala, Shane and Stephanie got to cover the ER solo. April warned them to call an attending if things would go over their heads. A couple of junkies were soon brought in, one of which developed serious heart defects. Shane was loving it all, calling it like whack-a-mole. Stephanie thought they needed help, but Shane said there wasn't anything they couldn't handle. Stephanie questioned this, but it was what they had been working towards all year. This was their shot and when another trauma was coming in, he asked Stephanie if she wanted to call for help or be a rock star. She joined him in choosing for the latter. The junkie tamponaded and Shane performed a pericardiocentesis on his own, still thinking of himself as a rock star. Stephanie got worried over the patient's condition and called Yang, who ordered to get Shane and the patient to the OR immediately. In the OR, Cristina complimented his courage and said he was a shark, which is a good thing as the best surgeons are. She allowed him to make the decisions in the OR and the surgery turned into a success. After the high of the surgery, Shane went back to the ER where Stephanie was cleaning up a trauma room. They agreed they were rock sharks and he kissed her, only to be pushed away by Stephanie as Jackson walked in. Shane just went back to work and enthusiastically started working on the victims of a multi-car mashup.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, Shane worked on Richard's case again while also being on Meredith and Cristina's service, complimenting the latter's surgical skills. Meredith constantly used him to have messages delivered and when he reported back, he awkwardly turned away as Meredith was pumping. This made Meredith notice how awkward he could feel.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nShortly after having passed the intern exam, Shane discovered that there was accidentally made a personal lab coat for Heather Brooks. He stormed out, leaving the other residents wondering if something was wrong. He didn't say a word after the exam and didn't come to celebrate with them. Due to his guilt over Heather's death, Shane asked to be let off Derek's service after the day. Derek replied that he specifically requested him, as he wanted to make up for how he treated him earlier, when he constantly chose Heather. However, Shane switched services earlier when he proposed a very creative fix for Cristina's patient, suggesting they use glue used for brains to fix Cristina's patient's AVM. During the surgery with Cristina, she complimented him about the fix, saying he was full of surprises. At the end of the day, Shane purposefully burned his bridge with Derek when the latter asked him to scrub on [[Mickey Wenschler|Mickey's]] surgery. Shane refused to, leading to Derek telling him to get over the feeling of being second choice after Heather. Shane then clearly stated he did not want to work with Derek anymore. At the end of the day, when Stephanie tried to make it clear that their kiss didn't mean anything to her, he said he already forgot about it. He had just done in the heat of the moment and he pointed out that, contrary to him, she was still talking about it. She noticed how much he's changed and asked herself what happened to him.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nShane was reminded of Heather again on Halloween, when a patient kept on refusing to be examined by him as she wanted to wait for Dr. Brooks. Advised by Dr. Bailey, Shane didn't tell the patient Heather died and tried to find hospital records of the woman so he could start to treat her, but he couldn't find any. Stephanie pointed out to him that Heather used to help the unhoused and uninsured under the table. When the patient collapsed, she had no other option but to let Shane treat her. Shane even refused to scrub in on a surgery to stay with the woman. He then told the patient that Heather died a couple of months ago and she confirmed his suspicion that Heather treated her under the table. She didn't want to get Heather in trouble, which is why she wanted to wait for her. Shane gave her free asthma inhalers, like Heather used to, and promised her he would be her doctor from now on. When asked if he was as good as Dr. Brooks, he replied he wasn't, but he would be eventually.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\nAfter he helped Heather's old patient on Halloween, Shane started concentrating on his work. While on Cristina's service, he read an article on an experimental procedure involving a -D printer and convinced her to try it on the deteriorating Glazier baby that had a serious heart defect. Cristina initially refused, because they would have to interrupt Meredith's research to use her -D printer, but Shane managed to convince her. They destroyed Meredith's model that was being printed in order for them to start printing.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhile being on Cristina's service a lot to help on the Glazier case, Shane did more than just concentrating on his work. He was constantly drinking energy drinks to always be on the top of his game and acted quite rude to anyone that wasn't Cristina. He unnoticedly came into the patient room when Cristina told Alex she needed to have sex, as she's better at her job when she's getting laid. He informed her their conduit had failed and they needed to print another one. Seeing Meredith was supposed to have the printer according to the schedule that they worked out, Cristina had to tell her that they would need the printer longer. Noticing she didn't want to tell Meredith, Shane said he'd have Stephanie tell Meredith. He then told her he was available in case she wanted to get her \"yaya's\" out, just for the sake of the work. He complimented her looks, but Cristina declined. Shane harshly told Stephanie they would need the printer again, but in the evening, the conduit was flawed again. This meant they would need the printer for more time, again. When Meredith came to tell them she really needed the printer and kept on picking on Cristina for failing to modernize medicine with her flashy procedure, Shane came to Cristina's defense, saying it was enough now. He blankly yelled Meredith was making this professional issue about her friendship with Cristina, whom he says initially refused to do it because of that friendship. \"You'll get the printer tomorrow, doctor Grey!\" he yelled, forcing Meredith to leave. In return for standing up for her, Cristina kissed Shane.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, they started off a sexual relationship, with Shane constantly doing his best to please her in bed. On the day of the surgery on the Glazier baby, Shane offered the last two gallery seats to two of his fellow residents. Shane had the idea to film the entire surgery so other surgeons from all over the country could watch and learn. He hadn't told Cristina about this, as he made this executive decisions after having gotten emails from surgeons all over the country, but he offered her to veto any of the decision. However, she agreed to the plan. During the surgery, Shane brought in the -D printed conduit, which they successfully placed inside his body, though Nathan soon started crashing. Cristina ordered Shane to stop the cameras. After the surgery, Nathan was placed on an ocillator. Shane ended up in an elevator with Meredith. When asked how he was doing, he told her not to be smug. He acrimoniously congratulated her for her successful procedure, admitting that Meredith won and that he and Cristina lost. She tried to talk to him about the way he had been speaking to her lately, but he just walked off. Meredith went to talk to Cristina about Shane's changed behavior, but Cristina says he's just being focused on the work. Cristina was paged to Nathan's room, where she and Shane saw that Nathan had stabilized. They celebrated it with a little victory dance.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nShane figured out how to edit his hours in the system so he could make it look like he was working less than he actually was. He drank energy drinks to stay awake. While Cristina was at April's wedding, Jimmy Evans had a heart attack. Shane and Leah took him into surgery by themselves rather than call Cristina. While in surgery, Shane got in over his head. Leah sent someone away to call someone to help, but Shane continued to insist that he could do it. He snapped and referred to the patient as \"she,\" so Leah ran out of the OR herself to get someone. She brought back Richard, who managed to talk to Shane, who was having flashes back to when he told Heather to go find Richard in the basement, and get him to leave the OR while Richard tried to fix what Shane had done. Shane left the OR and appeared almost catatonic in the elevator as he left.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter leaving the OR during Jimmy's surgery, Shane went to a bench outside the hospital and fell asleep.\n\nThree weeks later, Shane came back to work. Owen assigned him to work with him. In surgery, Owen quizzed Shane on embryology. Over Richard's objections, he continued to ask questions, believing that Shane should know about it. When Shane apologized for not knowing the answer, Owen said that Shane should be apologizing to Jimmy's family and kicked him out of the OR.\n\nShane went to Alex to apologize, but Alex tackled him and started punching him in the face. Cristina and Meredith broke up the fight and Cristina took Shane to treat his wounds. He told Cristina that he was trying to make it right. He didn't believe he deserved to feel better. She agreed with him that he deserved for Alex to punch him. Then she told him that [[Ashley Glazier]] had sent her a photo of [[Nathan Glazier|Nathan]] with food all over his face. Normally, the photo would be annoying, but this one is miraculous. She said it was due to Shane having the idea and pushing her to do it that Ashley was even able to take that picture. It was a good decision and she tells him to make more of those going forward.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of who had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAt Richard's birthday party, Owen asked him to be director of the residency program because he noticed how well he'd been mentoring the residents.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nDerek, warned that he wasn't teaching enough, took all the residents to work on a case with him that he had rescheduled several times. As the OR wasn't available until  AM, he then took them to the ER to work on the incoming patients, including having them work on a patient who was already dead so they could work with real brain tissue. When a man came in with scissors puncturing his forehead, they took him into an OR for a controlled extraction. Then they went back to the case of [[Nova Jenkins]]. Each of the residents took a turn to step up to the microscope and ask a question so they could learn.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nShane worked with Cristina on her HLHS trial. He screened patients so that she only had to look at their hearts. When a patient came in who didn't meet the criteria for the trial, but who was desperate, he tried to talk to Cristina about her. However, Cristina was firm that she didn't qualify and told Shane that she wouldn't add the patient to the trial.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nWhen a virus was going around the hospital, Shane passed the conduit babies over to Stephanie because he was worried that he was sick and he didn't want to jeopardize the trial. In exchange, he agreed to take her weekend calls for a month and be her swap monkey for two months.<ref>[[You Be Illin']], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Cristina prepared to leave Seattle to move to Switzerland for her new job, Shane came to her and begged her to take him with her as he didn't want his education to stall and he wanted to continue to learn from her. She agreed to take him with her.<ref>[[Fear (of the Unknown)]], x</ref>\n\n\nShane is initially shown to be awkward, energetic, and passionate. He initially went out of his way to flatter the primary surgeons in order to receive attention, primarily from Derek Shepherd whom he idolizes. He has also been shown to be very passionate about his work and his patients. Shane was devastated when he was replaced on Derek's service by Heather Brooks. Even more so when he was told by Derek that hard work doesn't beat out natural talent. This had a big impact on Shane, since he had dreamed of following in Derek's footsteps. When Heather died, Shane felt deep regret and confessed this to Derek when they were operating on her.\n\nShane is well-liked around the hospital (by his fellow interns and the attendings). April and Derek have especially taken a liking to him. Derek has also noted that Shane is an extremely hard worker. He goes out of his way to please. However, as time progressed following Heather's death, Shane became more aggressive and disrespectful towards others, even the attendings. He showed ambition that rivaled Cristina's in her intern year (though lacking Cristina's innate talent), leading to her giving him the nickname \"Sharky\". While operating on [[Alex Karev|Alex's]] father, Shane had a psychiatric episode and became convinced that he was operating on [[Heather Brooks|Heather]].\n\n\n\n[[Stephanie Edwards]]\nHe kissed Stephanie after a long night in the ER with her. Jackson walked in just as she pushed him off. He later said that he just did in the moment, and forgot about it shortly after. Stephanie did remember, though she believed him when he said it didn't mean anything to him. She then forgot about it too.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nAfter hearing Cristina talk to Alex about how she needed to have sex because her work suffers when she doesn't, Shane offered his services to her as stress relief.<ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nShane and Cristina embarked on a sexual relationship after they worked together to save a patient and make medical history. After he spoke for her on the press conference about the procedure, she brushed him off when he proposed to have sex again, and told him they were not going to do that anymore.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\nLater, after the non-fraternization policy was enacted, Cristina asked Ross if he ever felt like she had compromised his education or if he felt pressured to do things for her. He assured her that he didn't.<ref>[[Throwing it All Away]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[April Kepner]]\nShane had a good professional relationship with April starting when he helped her during \"lumps and bumps\" day.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n\nWhen April invited Shane to [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey's]] wedding, he believed it was just a professional thing, a way to get to know the interns in a less formal setting. When [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] informed him that that was not the case, he panicked and planned a series of talking points so that things wouldn't drift in a personal direction.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nWhen he confronted April about it, she informed him that she didn't mean it to be romantic at all, much to his relief.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\n\nShane was a [[General Surgery|surgical]]\uaresident\uaat [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\nHe used to idolize [[Derek Shepherd]]\uaand also enjoyed\uaworking closely with [[April Kepner]]. Because of his idolization of Derek, Shane wanted to work with him all the time and he picked [[Neurosurgery|neuro]] as his favorite [[Surgery#Surgical Specialties|specialty]]. When [[Chief of Surgery|Chief]] [[Owen Hunt|Hunt]] forced Derek to mentor other interns, such as [[Heather Brooks]], Shane thought Heather wanted to steal neuro from him. He told her he wouldn't let her steal neuro from him without a fight. However, when he caused Heather's death, he decided not to chase neuro anymore due to his guilt over her death, and thereby (quite aggressively) declined when Derek offered him to scrub in on a neurosurgery.\n\nDuring the gala evening, Shane manned the ER with Stephanie. He performed a pericardiocentesis on his own, and eventually scrubbed in with Cristina to continue operating on the patient. Since [[Cristina Yang]]\uatold him during that surgery that it's good to be a shark, he enjoys working with\uaand seems to be now favoring [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardio]], as Cristina chose him as the resident to assist on her -D printed conduit.\n\nShane left [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to work with and learn from\ua[[Cristina Yang]] in Zurich at the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]].\n\n\n*He never wanted to be anything other than a surgeon.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n*Appearing in only two seasons, Shane has appeared in the fewest seasons of any series regular. He and [[Leah Murphy]] are the only two characters to be a series regular for only one season.\n*In a \"Sliding Doors\" episode featuring Cristina Yang, Shane was awarded a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]].<ref>[[Do You Know?]], x</ref>\n*After his move to [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]], it is very likely that Shane is now a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] rather than a [[General Surgery|surgical resident]] since Klausman's focus is on heart research.\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxShaneRoss.png\nxShaneRoss.png\nxShaneRoss.png\nxShaneRoss.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Shane-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Man on the Moon]]\n*[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\n\n\n:'''[[April Kepner|April]]:''' Who put you up to this?

The tumor had good margins, but removing it would leave a large gap in his skull and skin and that would disqualify him for a transplant.

My whole life and I think I need to see everything that's not in a hospital. I need to travel and explore and hike and breathe, and breathe...and breathe. Breathe real air. So deep, I want to breathe it all in. Away from the monitors, and the blood, and the sterile gowns, away from saving other people's lives. I want my own. It's time I live my own. You changed my life, Dr. Webber. You taught me how to take my past and find my path. Thank you.|'''Stephanie Edwards''' to '''[[Richard Webber]]'''}}\n\n'''Stephanie Edwards''' was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at\ua[[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] until she quit to explore and travel after an explosion in the hospital caused her significant burns.\n\n\n\nStephanie was born with Sickle-Cell Disease. At the age of five, she was put in a clinical trial at [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|St. Jude]] that used bone marrow transplants to treat the disease. The treatment was very effective for her and [[Unseen Staff (Grey's Anatomy)#Old Time and Rock and Roll|Dr. Keith Wagner]], who ran the study, called Stephanie one of the most successful stories from the trial. Her memory of the trial is resisting and being told it was for her own good. There were even times when they had to strap her down to get her to accept the treatment.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], x</ref>\n\n\nStephanie started her internship at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] shortly after the [[Flight|plane crash]]. She, along with the other interns, quickly learned to fear [[Meredith Grey]], dubbing her Medusa.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working on the case of [[Graham Cunningham]], Cristina allowed Stephanie the opportunity to do a procedure, even saying that Stephanie was better than Shane. When Bailey stepped in, Cristina backed off, but then ultimately decided to let Stephanie close, over Bailey's objections.<ref>[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]], x</ref>\n\nWhile competing with Leah while they were both on [[Cristina Yang|Cristina's]] service, they both were indefinitely banned from the OR when their fighting led to Leah hooking up a [[Mrs. Crossley|patient's]] oxygen to her IV, a potentially fatal mistake.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n\nWhen it seemed like the hospital was going to be sold, Stephanie started looking at programs at other hospitals because she wanted to be the best and to be the best, she had to learn at the best program.<ref>[[Hard Bargain]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Heather died, the other interns were given time off. Derek told them to think of happy Heather stories for her mother, but they realized they didn't have any as they were not very close to her. They went to Meredith and she told them a story about George stealing jello for all of them, a story she had shared with George's mother when he died. They used alcohol from Alex to get drunk and bond, but when Heather's mother arrived, they still didn't have a story to tell her, so they stole Meredith's George story, as well as using a question Stephanie had asked Jo and changing it to involve Heather. Using their newfound bond, the four of them went out to the pile as a group to help.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the interns began all sleeping at Alex's house and studying. Jo was waiting for Alex to proposition her so they could have sex and Alex was waiting because he thought she was still grieving, so he said they could stay there as long as they wanted. Jo went to the others and said that they needed to leave. <ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\n\nThe day before Halloween, Stephanie had LASIK eye surgery. She came back to work right away rather than taking the two days off that were recommended. She spent the day running into things. At the end of the day, Jackson told her that he had planned to take the day off with her and take care of her. She asked if they could do it the next day, but he said they'd do it now and took her home.<ref>[[Thriller]], x</ref>\n\n\nStephanie worked with Meredith as she started her portal vein trial. After siding with Alex over Meredith in a surgery, Meredith didn't want to work with Stephanie anymore.<ref>[[Two Against One]], x</ref>\n\nStephanie operated with Meredith when she put the first printed portal vein in a sheep. The surgery was successful, but the sheep later died.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Meredith hired a bioengineer to work on the portal vein trial with her, Stephanie was assigned to watch him as he read all the research materials and not allow him to touch the printer. When he doodled something that Stephanie found interesting, she asked him how it would work. Stephanie went to Meredith to ask for permission for [[Eric Block]] to use the printer, but Meredith denied permission. However, Meredith later came back to the lab to find them using the printer. Meredith said that she really wanted to work to get her trial off the ground.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\n\nStephanie was confused when April invited her to her and Matthew's wedding, as she expected to be Jackson's guest. However, Jackson was not invited because of his past with April, and inviting Stephanie was April's way of getting Jackson there. Stephanie believed that Jackson and April weren't really over each other because if they were, they would be congratulating each other. Despite this, Jackson assured her that there was nothing going on with them and that they could go to the wedding. <ref>[[Somebody That I Used to Know]], x</ref>\n\nApril told Jackson that she wanted him to be there, so Stephanie and Jackson attended the wedding. However, Jackson stood up at the wedding, and confessed his love for April, effectively ending his relationship with Stephanie.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\nStephanie walked out of the hospital that night. Three weeks later, Leah and Jo were surprised to see her back finally, though she claimed she wasn't in hiding. She avoided interacting with Jackson. However, when her patient, [[Robert Fischer]], expressed desire to undo the changes he'd made to his body to look like a cat, she went to Jackson and asked him to fix Robert's face pro bono.\n\nShe talked to Leah about how hard it was to be around Jackson and how she knew that dating him was a bad idea, but she did it anyway. Leah told Stephanie that it was Jackson's fault because he was her boss and he chose to date her and then he chose to toss her aside like Arizona had done with her and Cristina had done with Shane. She said it was awful and that someone should do something about it.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen the non-fraternization policy was introduced, Jo immediately assumed that Stephanie had filed the claim that led to the policy being enacted although it was really Leah Murphy.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAfter hitting both Arizona and Jackson with gurneys in the same day, Stephanie had to go to HR to fill out an accident report. Jackson was in there at the same time filling out his own paperwork about the incident. Jackson told her that he didn't plan what he did at the wedding. He apologized for it and said he didn't know how to make it better. Stephanie said he couldn't. She got looks of pity, something she'd never had before. But she was done feeling bad about it. To her, he just existed and she didn't care about him at all.<ref>[[Throwing it All Away]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of who had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAt Richard's birthday party, Owen asked him to be the director of the residency program because he noticed how well he'd been mentoring the residents.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Shane was worried that he was sick, Stephanie took over the conduit patients for the day in exchange for him taking her weekend calls for a month and being her swap monkey for two months.<ref>[[You Be Illin']], x</ref>\n\nWhen Stephanie got bored watching Bailey look through options, she pulled swap monkey on Shane and sent him to work with her while she printed sample conduits for Cristina's trial. However, when Shane ended up in surgery instead, Stephanie tried to call swap monkey to switch back. She tried again to swap to go back to Bailey after surgery and ended up chasing Shane down the hall.<ref>[[I'm Winning]], x</ref>\n\nDerek, warned that he wasn't teaching enough, took all the residents to work on a case with him that he had rescheduled several times. As the OR wasn't available until  AM, he then took them to the ER to work on the incoming patients, including having them work on a patient who was already dead so they could work with real brain tissue. When a man came in with scissors puncturing his forehead, they took him into an OR for a controlled extraction. Then they went back to the case of [[Nova Jenkins]]. Each of the residents took a turn to step up to the microscope and ask a question so they could learn.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nStephanie worked with Bailey on the case of [[Braden Morris]], who was born with SCID, which left him vulnerable to illness. His parents consented to them using de-activated HIV as a vector to deliver an enzyme to his body, but before the procedure could be done, his mother withdrew consent. Despite this, Bailey proceeded with the procedure, desperate to prove that her research would help people.<ref>[[Change of Heart]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Braden's t-cell count jumped overnight, Stephanie confronted Bailey about it and Bailey confirmed to her that she had done the treatment without consent.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Bailey came clean to the parents, Bailey and Stephanie were both involved in legal meetings. When the parents announced their intent to sue and get Bailey's medical license revoked as well as charging her with assault and battery, Stephanie took the blame, saying that she didn't tell Bailey that the parents had revoked consent and Bailey was covering for her. They dropped the charges and Stephanie was suspended for a week.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n\nPer Eliza Minnick's instructions, Stephanie went to counseling, but she returned to work after only a few sessions with Richard's support. On her first day back, she and [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] treated [[Keith]], who was brought in along with [[Alison Goodman]] after the car they were in drove off a cliff. Since both were partially undressed, the doctors assumed them to be a couple who were making out. Eliza punished Stephanie for quitting counseling and left her to monitor Keith, who had a liver lac. When they were alone, Keith begged Stephanie to take him to go see Alison. She agreed to his request, while the other doctors found out through Alison that Keith is a stranger who got in her car and tried to rape her. [[Hannah Brody|Intern Hannah]] came across Stephanie and informed her that a patient had been raped, oblivious to the fact that Keith was said, rapist. As soon as she was gone, Keith pressed Stephanie against a wall and threatened her with a scalpel. He demanded that she take him out of the hospital without anyone seeing. They came across Ben, but Stephanie convinced him she was just helping her patient get back on his feet.\n\nAs they entered the stairwell, Keith dragged her through a door as he heard security approaching. They ended up near a lab and as Keith wanted to enter the stairwell again, they found out the doors wouldn't open because of a lockdown initiated by Bailey. To make matters worse, they were trapped with [[Erin Miller]], a child who had been wandering the hospital all day. Figuring that a fire would override the lockdown, Keith gathered supplies to start a fire while Stephanie protected Erin. As Keith was busy holding a burning towel up to the sprinklers, Stephanie seized the opportunity and sprayed Keith with hand alcohol. Burning fibers fell down and lit Keith on fire. Stephanie shut herself and Erin into the nearest room, but quickly realized that Keith's burning body fell just a few inches from the oxygen tanks in the adjacent room. Stephanie quickly went to drag him away, but the tanks burst right before she could stop it. <ref>[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]], x</ref>\n\nStephanie recovered from the blast in the burning lab as Erin was calling her name. Erin's leg was trapped under a machine. Stephanie created a path through the flames towards Erin. She used lab supplies to tie off the blood supply to the wound and clamped the vessel. She helped Erin get up. When their path was blocked by flames, Stephanie wet a blanket and her hair at the sink, picked up Erin, and jumped through the flames with the blanket wrapped around them. They entered the stairwell and discovered the floors beneath them were on fire already. They slowly went up, with Stephanie supporting Erin. Upon reaching the door to the roof, Stephanie discovered her key card was gone. Since they were trapped by the ascending fire, Stephanie sat down with Erin and wrapped her in the blanket to give her the best chance of surviving and accepted her own fate. However, as Stephanie glanced down at floors engulfed in flames below her, she spotted her badge on the floor through the smoke. She went to retrieve it, and they accessed the roof. No one on the ground heard her cries for help and Erin suddenly coded. Stephanie started CPR and was still doing so when Ben and the firefighters finally found them.\n\nShe and Erin were taken to the ER since the OR floor was inaccessible due to the damage. She yelled at Eliza to get out of her face and stayed with Erin when Richard and Bailey operated right there. With Erin finally stable and her leg saved, Stephanie's body finally shut down. She was taken to the burn unit for the severe burns on her arms. Richard came to visit her. While telling her that she was gonna be all right, but it would be a while until she could perform surgery, Stephanie, who was still traumatized by the whole incident, said that due to the fact she had spent her whole life in hospitals, she thought she should go anywhere that was not the inside of a hospital and wanted to travel, explore, hike, and breathe away from the monitors, blood, and sterile gowns. She concluded that she was done saving other people's lives and she wanted to go out and live her own life, away from the hospital. She thanked Richard for changing her life and teaching her how to take her past and find her path and that now she has found it. She quit and then told Andrew to turn up the morphine to stop the pain. Richard stayed and accompanied her while Andrew turned up the morphine as Stephanie was calming down.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\nThe day after the fire, she was airlifted to a burn unit in Texas to continue her recovery. Bailey later revealed to the owner of the hospital, Harper Avery that her bravery during the incident has been all over the news. <ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\n\n\nHer grandmother used to say that everyone is their own kind of crazy and that the secret to finding love is to find the person whose crazy complements your own.<ref>[[One Flight Down]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Jackson Avery]]\n[[April Kepner|April]] set her up as [[Jackson Avery|Jackson's]] date to [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey's]] wedding.\uaThey missed the ceremony, so\ua[[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] suggested he just take her home. She misinterpreted, letting him know she did not want to sleep with her boss.\uaThey both agreed that sleeping together would be a mistake, but\uaended up having sex\uaright there in the car anyway.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nThey initially kept things quiet because Stephanie didn't want anyone thinking she was sleeping with her boss to get ahead.<ref>[[The End is the Beginning is the End]], x</ref>\n\nThey began seeing each other.\ua[[Jackson Avery|Jackson]]\uastated it was just sex, whereas Stephanie believed it was more serious than that because she stated that she would follow him if\uahe were to move and get a job somewhere else.\n\nWhen Jackson's mother came to town to see him, he sent Stephanie away so that his mother wouldn't interrogate her.<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\nWhen his new role as board director started to interfere with their relationship, as he began to forget dates, she asked him why he'd been standing her up and demanded to be treated better. He kissed her and she stopped talking.<ref>[[Do You Believe in Magic]], x</ref>\n\nThe night of the fundraising gala, Stephanie was mad at Jackson because he didn't invite her to go with him because he believed that she didn't want to go. After working closely with Shane on a group of junkies while covering the ER, Shane kissed her, which Jackson saw. He fled back to the gala, but she followed him. They fought and Stephanie explained what had happened, so they made up.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson's mother came back to [[Seattle]] to visit Richard, Stephanie met her when she burst into the on-call room where Jackson and Stephanie were making out, giving his mother a bad impression of her. While they worked on a patient with an enlarged penis together, Catherine continued to tease Stephanie. Later, at the bar, Stephanie talked to Catherine about what had happened.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nStephanie went to April's wedding with Jackson. During the ceremony, Jackson stood up and confess his love for April, thus ending his relationship with Stephanie.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref>\n\n[[Kyle Diaz]]\nKyle heavily flirted with\uaStephanie\uaduring his hospitalization.<ref>[[I Wear the Face]], x</ref>\n\nShe agreed to text him during his tour and said they might be able to go out when he got back. They ended up exchanging dirty texts.<ref>[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Kyle came back into town, he asked Stephanie to go out with him. She tried to decline, worried that what they had was all texts, but he showed up at the hospital and she agreed to go with him when he said he wanted to take her somewhere special. She went with him to a recording studio, where they started to kiss and then undress.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], x</ref>\n\nThey continued to see each other, though without labeling their relationship. When Kyle developed a tremor in his other hand, Stephanie told him to go to the hospital, where she stayed by his side as he waited for surgery and waited in the waiting room while he was in surgery. After his surgery, she came to visit him before he woke up and left a note ending things between them.<ref>[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]], x</ref>\n\nHe came back to the ER with meningitis.<ref>[[Mama Tried]], x</ref> While he was there, he refused to see Stephanie or having her involved in his case.

She agreed to take a look at the research and she ultimately agreed to perform the surgery.\n\nIn surgery, Travis became unstable, requiring Callie to close quickly.

They also observed a small murmur. Callie ordered antibiotics and took him into the OR to clean out the infected tissue. Callie ultimately had to remove the hip joint to clean out the infection.\n\nAfter the surgery, Travis started to form multiple clots in his leg. His right leg turned gray and Callie took him into the OR for an embolectomy. She convinced Cristina to wait an additional day to operate on his heart. After the embolectomy, Travis\us leg was pink again. However, the next day, both of his lower legs had turned black. His legs were amputated that evening.\n\n\nAfter the amputation, Travis was cruel and lashed out at Whitney and at Callie.
