The propeller pulled her in, and both her arms were neatly amputated and were retrieved from the water by Jasmine. Her right leg was also hanging on by a thread. In the ER, Mark said the amputations were clean and the arms could be re-attached.\n\n\nAfter dropping off her backpack, her traveling buddies left while she was in surgery to catch a concert in Las Vegas. Knowing that she would need the support during her recovery, [[Cristina Yang]] ordered [[Lexie Grey]] to befriend Clara and become her support system. Meanwhile, Jasmine and Jo constantly sent Clara postcards of their travels. Clara also refused to tell her mother, who was in London, about her situation and instead lied to her through her e-mails for weeks by telling her about her fake travels, because she didn't want the woman who \"built her from scratch\" to know how badly she was hurt.\n\n\nWhile her arms were reattached, she was unable to move them for days. Clara became depressed when moving her fingers slightly was a big accomplishment. She told Lexie they should have let her die. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\nClara later told Lexie she was doing better and she could call off the suicide watch. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nClara was told she had an infection in her small bowel and her colon was inflamed, meaning she needed another surgery. She refused surgery because she didn't want to be cut open again. It was the only option. When Lexie read an email she'd composed to Clara's mother, telling her everything that happened, saying that she'd either page the doctors for surgery or hit send, Clara let them take her into surgery. The infection had worsened because of the delay, but they were able to remove a portion of her bowel and she was taken to recovery. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nAfter she recovered from her surgery, Clara was fitted with a prosthetic and [[Jon]], a physical therapist, came in to get her up and trying to walk again. She resisted physical therapy. After Jon said that this is where the hard part begins, she refused to continue and wouldn't allow any further sessions. Owen wanted to call for a psych consult, but Lexie said they were calling her ceviche and she couldn't go out like that. She laughed and acknowledged that that was horrible. She then allowed Jon to come back. They got her up and she was able to take a few steps on her prosthetic. She then told Lexie to call her mother. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\n\nHer mother always told her that she'd made her body from scratch, trying to get her to be more careful with herself. As a result, when she was hospitalized, she didn't call her mother.

She then began to fight with the nurses, calling one of them a soccer mom, but Meredith diffused it and dragged Cristina out of the bar. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nWhen there was a bomb in [[James Carlson|a patient's]] chest cavity, Debbie informed the Chief when the Bomb Squad arrived to help after a bomb threat. ''(\"[[It's the End of the World]]\")'' She also later provided the hospital blueprints, which showed that the bomb was directly over the hospital's main oxygen line. ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n\nWhile Debbie was walking through the tunnels, she was cornered by [[Callie Torres]], who asked her who George's friends were, where he lived, whether or not Debbie had worked with him much, how he was with patients and doctors, his pet peeves, and if he had a girlfriend. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Shawn Beglight]] came into the hospital with a head injury, Debbie was one of his nurses. She assisted the doctors when they had to drill a burr hole in his hospital room and then [[Rick Beglight|Rick]], Shawn's father, threw up on her. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Steve Mostow]]\nDebbie considered pursuing a romantic relationship with [[Steve Mostow|Steve]] after he passed out in her car the week before Halloween. On the night of Halloween, they met up at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's bar]].\n\n[[Dr. Taylor]]\nShe dated [[Dr. Taylor]] for a time. They bonded over doing crosswords together in the OR and he eventually used a crossword joke to ask her out on a date. Things broke off between them because she didn't like that he didn't like to do anything that didn't involve alcohol. After they split, she kept being drawn to him, even though she knew it was a bad idea. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, her uncle Pete passed away. He was a nurse and was an activist for Equal Male Nursing Opportunities. Debbie says that he was a man ahead of his time. Her aunt Lucy, who was also a nurse, made rice krispie stuffing and says that Pete ate too much of it. In addition to Pete and Lucy being nurses, Debbie's sister Val, all her cousins, and her great-grandmother, Byrd were all nurses as well. Debbie said that her cousin Betty had a good sense of humor but had low self-esteem. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\nHer clique is [[Tyler Christian|Tyler]], [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]], and Liz.\n\n\nShe and Joe are best friends. They met at the bar, and Debbie recalls that he was pouring her tequila, but they knew they would be friends on the day of the first annual Emerald City Darts Tournament. When it was time to play, Joe needed a partner after his flaked on him, and Debbie volunteered to be his partner. Her dart skills brought her and Joe up to semifinals, where they lost. Joe congratulated Debbie on her dart skills and she thanked him for taking her mind off work. While munching on peanuts, they began to gossip about the people they both knew. Debbie then had the revelation that they shared a connection to almost every person at Seattle Grace; Debbie saw them at work, and Joe saw them after work. Debbie said that it was like \"comparing notes\". They have been best friends ever since. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n[[Elizabeth Fallon]]\nShe was good friends with Elizabeth while she worked at the hospital. When she died, Debbie was in the room and she said it was a strangely serene moment. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n[[Yvonne]]\nYvonne and Debbie hit it off while [[Mary]] was being treated. Debbie even managed to get them some jello cups, despite the cafeteria being closed. When Yvonne died due to internal bleeding, Debbie said that it hit her hard since she looked fine but was more damaged then most of the patients in the room. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nAfter Cristina stole a patient from the psych ward and dismissed Debbie rudely after asking for paperwork on the patient, she paged her constantly for rectal exams and other disgusting cases. At the end of the day, Cristina went to Bailey, assuming that it was her, and asked why she was paged for all those cases, but Bailey said that she had no idea what she was talking about. Debbie then says to Cristina that if she had shown a little respect, she could've saved herself a ''very long day''.\n\nDuring the nurses' strike, she pelted the nurses with half a dozen tuna sandwiches. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")'' At Joe's bar, the nurses retaliated by pouring a drink on Cristina's lap. She then began to get into a fight with the nurses, calling one a soccer mom, but [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] dragged Cristina out of the bar before it could happen. ''(\"[[Break on Through]])''\n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nAfter he refused to cross the picket line, Debbie said that she had a newfound respect for George. Debbie and a few other nurses sent George into the hospital so that they could receive reports on their patients. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nShe has a good professional relationship with Richard. He says she is like family and also says that while Adele keeps him in check at home, Debbie is the one that keeps him in line at work. She informs Adele of what he is doing at the hospital and calls her if Richard is stuck in surgery and won't make it home for dinner. Debbie also reminds him about birthdays, holidays, and wedding anniversaries. For his th birthday, Debbie threw a surprise party at the hospital and Richard says he will never forget it. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she started at Seattle Grace, she was intimidated by [[Ellis Grey]] and says she was the Cristina Yang of her class. Debbie says that Ellis is still is one of the most skilled doctors she ever worked with. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\nShe worked at Seattle Grace as a nurse from the time of Ellis Grey and remained until at least [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] second year of residency. She was a large part of the nurses' strike when the hospital was understaffed. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\nBefore working at Seattle Grace, she worked at County Hospital.

I know we've had our differences and I'm sorry we've been out of touch. Believe it or not, I was trying to make everything better. I know you're angry but I hope you can forgive me. Turns out, sometimes you have to do the wrong thing... Sometimes you have to make big mistake to figure out how to make things right. Mistakes are painful, but they're the only way to find out who you really are. I know who I am now. I know what I want. I've got the love of my life, and a new heart. And I want you guys to get on the next plane out here and meet my girl. Everything's going to be different now.|'''Denny's''' voice mail to his parents.}}\n\n'''Denny Duquette''' was a heart patient and love interest of [[Izzie Stevens]]. He died of a stroke following a heart transplant. Later, he appeared to Meredith as a ghost type figure when she nearly drowned and again to Izzie when she had cancer.\n\n\n\nDenny had been a patient of [[Preston Burke]] for a long time. He had been diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy, which caused his heart to fail. He came into the hospital when a transplant became available for him and it's during this hospitalization that he met [[Izzie Stevens]]. The two of them flirted, but she ultimately had to break the news to him that he wasn't getting the heart, so he was discharged and left. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\nHe came back into the hospital later in heart failure. They stabilized him in the ER and then admitted him. He was later tachycardic, but alert. In order to slow his heart rate, they had to shock his heart, which was excruciating for him. After he was stable, he got to know Izzie better. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\nWhile hospitalized, Denny experienced shortness of breath and chest pains. His heart failure was getting worse despite medication. He later had flash pulmonary edema, so he was put on Bi-pap, but Burke said that he needed more. In order to extend the time he could wait for a heart transplant, he wanted to insert an [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]]. When he heard he wouldn't be able to leave the hospital after getting the LVAD, Denny said he needed to think about it. After speaking to Izzie about it, he decided to have the LVAD implanted. ''(\"[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\")''\n\n\nWhile on the LVAD, Denny started experiencing shortness of breath. He had a pulmonary embolism. They tried to use a catheter to clear it, but they couldn't, so they had to open his chest. They were able to relieve the clot and he was stable after surgery. ''(\"[[Superstition]]\")''\n\nDenny then started looking into a portable LVAD, which would allow him to get up and out of bed. Izzie opposed the idea, which caused Denny to be hesitant about it. Despite this, he went ahead with it, but he was having trouble breathing while on it. They had to intubate him, which stabilized him. They thought the tubing in his LVAD had gotten kinked. He was stable and able to get up and walk around after they fixed the problem. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nWhile walking around the hospital with his portable LVAD, Denny collapsed and fell in the hallway after trying to use the stairs. His LVAD battery was nearly dead, so they took him back to his room. He was upset with being confined to the hospital and said he wanted to go home. Izzie tried to get his spirits back up with chocolate and tabloids, but he told her to stop, saying he hated being weak. He said if she knew what it was like, she would have let him die. ''(\"[[Damage Case]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a heart became available for Denny at [[Mercy West Medical Center]], he was prepped for the surgery. He decided before the surgery to sign a DNR, saying that he was done if he didn't get the heart.\n\nWhen the donor flatlined, Burke tried to get the other donor's heart for Denny. In order to help his case, Izzie lied on the phone and said that Denny was getting worse. However, when they asked for labs to confirm, she realized she had to make his heart actually worse in order to fool them. She decided to cut his LVAD wire. Denny tried to stop her, but he relented when she started crying and said that she would never forgive him for making her love him if he died. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\nAfter cutting his LVAD wire, Izzie manually pumped his heart. When she found out Burke had been shot and wasn't coming, George took over pumping and the interns decided that they'd have to get the tests results themselves. Cristina looked at his heart. At this point, Denny woke back up and proposed to Izzie before coding. They used adenosine to stabilize him. At this point, Bailey came looking for them and found out what they were doing. She took over treatment and then consulted with Richard to figure out what they should do about the heart. They submitted the labs and had the heart brought over for transplant as instructed by UNOS. Because Burke had been shot, [[Erica Hahn]] was brought in to perform the transplant. She placed the heart and attempted to get it started. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\nThe heart eventually started to beat and they closed. After surgery, he marveled at having warm hands and a regular heart beat. He was stable in his room, but later that night, he threw a clot off his incision and died of a stroke. ''(\"[[Losing My Religion]]\")''\n\n\nAfter his death, Izzie struggled to figure out what to do with the money he'd left her. She used about $, of it to pay for [[Heather Douglas]] to have surgery. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\nShe then decided to use the rest of the money to fund the free clinic that [[Miranda Bailey]] wanted to open. ''(\"[[Great Expectations]]\")''\n\nEight days later, the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]] opened to the public. ''(\"[[Wishin' and Hopin']]\")''\n\n\nMeredith's Near-Death Experience\nWhen Meredith drowned in [[Elliott Bay]], she woke up in the \"afterlife\" and saw Denny and [[Dylan Young]]. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nDylan and Denny bickered while Meredith wondered what she was doing, with Dylan wanted to tell her straight what was happening and Denny wanting to be more cautious about it. When it seemed that she had accepted her death and wasn't willing to fight to go back, they kept asking her what happened. They eventually got her to admit that she had stopped trying to survive. Denny told her that occasionally, he and Izzie would be in the same place at the same time and he could feel her. This made Meredith decide that she didn't just want moments with Derek, encouraging her to fight to go back. By then, they worried that she might be out of time. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\nIzzie's Hallucinations\nIzzie started seeing Denny while working on the case of the man who was supposed to get the heart she stole for Denny, [[Michael Norris]]. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nShe continued to see him as she worked on [[Clay Bedonie]], who suggested that she might be haunted by him. She had Alex burn the sweater she'd made him, which she kept. Despite this, she continued to see him. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nIzzie continued to see Denny and believed it was just memories, because they'd done the same things when he was alive, so he suggested they do something they hadn't done when he was alive, have sex. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\nBecause she was dating Alex, Izzie started talking to Denny about that and Denny expressed his disgust for seeing her with Alex. When she told Alex that she saw Denny sometimes, he dismissed it, saying it was cool with him because Denny's dead and he has her. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\nIzzie eventually asked Denny to leave, but he continued to stay and appear to her. He frequently said, \"I'm here for you,\" which frustrated her. He told her that she didn't have time to think about anything else. He said he thought that getting to be with her again was heaven, but then he started to think it was hell. Izzie eventually concluded that he was saying that because she was sick. She told him to leave, which he did. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\nAfter she learned that she had cancer, Izzie stopped seeing Denny for a while as she had the brain mets removed. When she saw him again, she knew it meant that she had a new brain met. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\nWhile the doctors fought over Izzie's treatment, she daydreamed about sitting on a beach with Denny. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\n\nHe says that he is funny and really nice. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Izzie lies with Denny.]]\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nDenny's father told [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] she was nothing like the women Denny usually dated.\n\nDenny first met Izzie when he was admitted to Seattle Grace Hospital as a heart transplant patient. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\nWhen he came back to the hospital later, their relationship started to develop more. ''(\"[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\")''\n\nSoon, she started playing Scrabble with him and spending all her free time in his room, even though she was seeing Alex at the time. ''(\"[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\")''\n\nIzzie took a celibacy vow along with Meredith and Meredith took up knitting. Izzie had to knit pieces of sweater and replace the ones Meredith did because Meredith wasn't good at knitting. Denny was shocked that she'd taken a vow of celibacy because he wondered how he'd be able to get into her pants with her being celibate. In addition to this, she made Denny a sweater of his own, which she then wore for three hours before giving it to him. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\nAfter seeing the way Izzie and Denny reacted when they disagreed over the portable LVAD, Bailey became worried that their relationship was starting to cross a line. ''(\"[[Blues for Sister Someone]]\")''\n\nAfter a rough day for him, during which he fell while trying to use stairs, Izzie came into his room and crawled into bed with him, even after he warned her that she'd get in trouble. ''(\"[[Damage Case]]\")''\n\nWhen a heart became available for Denny, Izzie was told she couldn't prep him for surgery because she'd gotten too attached. However, she convinced Bailey to let her do it, with a warning that she better not get too close. When the heart fell through and she was trying to get the other one, she convinced him to let her cut his LVAD wire to make his heart worse. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\nAfter Izzie cut his LVAD, he lost consciousness for a while. When he came to, he proposed to Izzie. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\nAfter his heart transplant, he confirmed that he wanted to marry her. He wanted something that was his own choice after years of doctors making choices for him. She agreed to marry him. When Denny died, Izzie climbed into his bed and wouldn't leave until Alex told her that Denny's body was not him and picked her up off of him. ''(\"[[Losing My Religion]]\")''\n\nWhen his father came to meet Izzie after Denny's death, he told Izzie that Denny was rich and had written her a check for . million dollars and a voice message to his parents telling them he had met the love of his life. The money he had given to Izzie was used to establish ''[[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]]''.\n\n\nDenny's parents were devastated when he was diagnosed. He'd never been sick a day in his life before his heart failure. One day, Denny left a note for his parents saying he didn't want them to have to watch him die. They assumed he was dead until he left them a voicemail telling them he'd gotten a new heart and was getting married. ''(\"[[What I Am]]\")''\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nDenny was friendly to all the doctors, particularly Izzie, but when Meredith drowned in Elliott Bay, he was extremely kind to her in the ''after-life''.

Leah stated that he had had  surgeries, which she thought at first couldn't be correct.\n\n\nTo bring a stop to the almost weekly surgeries, Bailey proposed to custom design a drug that would stop the growth of the tumors. To do so, she needed to take a sample of the tumors during another surgery and create a [[Genome Mapping|genome map]] of the tissue, so she could find the specific DNA marker that was responsible for the growth of the tumors. Elliot was extremely happy with the proposal, as it would mean no surgeries ever again.\n\nOutside his room, Leah stood up for herself and Bailey awarded her with allowing her to pull off the entire surgery to collect the samples needed for the genome map.

When Burke called Izzie to see if Denny is on top of the transplant list, Izzie lied and said he was getting worse, but needed the labs to prove it and cut Denny's LVAD wire.<ref>[[ Seconds]], x</ref> When Burke was shot, Erica was brought in to perform the heart transplant procedure.<ref>[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Harold O'Malley]] had a leaking aortic valve, and George originally wanted Burke to perform the procedure since he thought Burke was the best.<ref>[[Staring at the Sun]], x</ref> However, after becoming suspicious about Burke's hand, he wanted Erica to do the procedure. Despite this, his parents chose to have Burke do the procedure.<ref>[[From a Whisper to a Scream]], x</ref>\n\n\nErica returned to Seattle Grace once again to perform a heart transplant on a father with his brain dead daughter's heart, as Burke wasn't around to do it anymore. After performing the heart transplant, she accused Cristina of having slept her way to the top. Cristina in return called Hahn unprofessional and inappropriate. Erica smirked and then revealed she had just agreed to become the new Head of Cardiothorcic Surgery at Seattle Grace Hospital.<ref>[[Haunt You Every Day]], x</ref>\n\nOn her first day, Erica acquired the nickname \ucThe New Burke\" and met the handsome duo Derek and Mark, who had a gentlemen's evening planned with the Chief. When her patient, who turned out to be allergic to general anesthetia, required a risky open heart surgery, Richard called her in to talk through the surgery that Cristina had suggested to work around the patient's allergy. Hahn figured out the other male attendings didn't have to do this prior to a risky surgery and she called out Richard for being sexist, including the fact that female attendings weren't invited to his gentlemen's evening. She left to go prep for the surgery and denied Cristina the chance to scrub in, choosing Izzie over her. The surgery went well, and Erica then joined the three male attendings at the gentlemen's evening, to which Richard had invited her.<ref>[[Kung Fu Fighting]], x</ref>\n\nAfter some time at the hospital, Hahn changed the schedule in order not to have Cristina on her service and took Meredith off Mark's service. She took the case of the woman whom Cristina saved in the ER and then threw Cristina off the case so Meredith could operate with her. She took Mark's OR to do the surgery. Unbeknownst to Erica, her confident behavior and her surgical skill and finesse sparked Mark's interest.<ref>[[Physical Attraction... Chemical Reaction]], x</ref>\n\nCristina continued to try to impress Erica, but she only grew more annoyed with Cristina's desperate attempts and took a liking to Izzie. Out of necessity, she did page Cristina once to get scans. Throughout the day, she noticed all the attention Mark got because of his looks, but Erica herself remained uninterested.<ref>[[Forever Young]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of the ambulance crash, Hahn had a busy day dividing her time between her patient and a wounded paramedic. She happily let Cristina off her service per Bailey's request and replaced her with Izzie. Erica scrubbed in with Mark, who continued to flirt with her and asked her to meet for drinks, but she preferred to focus on the patient and ignored his moves on her.<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref>\n\nDue to being busy, Hahn failed to check the grafts of one of her patients, which resulted in a complication. Erica really beat herself up over it and Mark remarked she was as unkind to herself as she was to others. While trying to fix the complication, Erica kept on reminding herself that her patient had four children and she did everything she could, managing to save the patient. At the end of the day, she sat down with Callie and Mark and asked to get that drink together after all. Callie realized she needed a friend and joined them. Erica didn't even mind if Mark would be flirting with her, and they took off for Joe's.<ref>[[Crash Into Me, Part ]], x</ref>\n\n\nThat night out sparked a friendship between Erica and Callie. They really had fun and Erica outdrank Callie and beat her at darts, which made them agree to be on a first-name basis. They bonded over generally not being a people person, but Erica resented Mark, calling him a crass ape of a man when he tried to flirt with her again. However, at the end of the day, she ran into Mark and revealed to him that he was too pretty. They probably would be together if they weren't colleagues, but Erica was convinced she needed to let who she is outside of the hospital. She and Callie then left together to go drink at Joe's.<ref>[[Lay Your Hands on Me]], x</ref>\n\nThey went out together multiple times after that and hung out together frequently, building a true friendship. One time it got so late that they came into the hospital the next morning straight from the bar. Erica was operating on one patient and had Cristina deliver her hourly updates on another, all the while Cristina was trying to win a surgical contest. Hahn offered her to observe as she put in a new valve and Cristina abandoned the contest in favor of her education. That evening, Cristina came home to Callie and Erica drinking at their apartment. Cristina mentioned she was honored to have Hahn visit, but Hahn made it clear she was disturbing the conversation, making Cristina hide herself in her bedroom.<ref>[[Where the Wild Things Are]], x</ref> Their love was sparked in an elevator when Hahn kissed Callie after trying to prove Mark would be intimidated by their relationship in bed.\n\n\nErica and Callie got into a fight about what to do with Izzie Stevens after Erica found out Izzie stole the heart for Denny from one of Erica's patients. She wanted to report Izzie, but Callie was against it. Erica left the hospital parking lot and quit her job abruptly.<ref>[[Rise Up]], x</ref>\n\n\nErica Hahn presents herself as a confident woman, generally focused on her work and not afraid to speak her mind when she sees it right.\n\nDespite her tough approach with her colleagues, Hahn generally has a very good bedside manner and looks out for her patients' welfare to a great extent.\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Erica and Callie kiss.]]\nWhen Dr. Hahn took up a permanent position at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], one of the first things she said to Cristina was \"I date men\" (believing that Cristina got ahead by sleeping with her superiors). [[Mark Sloan]] continually flirted with her but although they were friends, she insisted that he only wanted her because he couldn't have her, though admitting that they might have had a chance if they didn't work together.\n\nAfter making a friend of Callie Torres and getting more involved personally, onlookers became suspicious of a bit more to their relationship. Addison Montgomery plants the seed in Callie's head that the two might be lovers, but when confronted, they both laugh it off, though the idea lingers. Following Mark Sloan's persistent, (if only half-joking) suggestions of starting a threesome, Erica asks Mark whether the idea of her and Callie in a relationship would be intimidating to him, and kisses her in the elevator to prove it. A conflicted Callie can't get Erica out of her head, and the two finally confront their feelings and uneasiness about the \"new territory\", and begin to date. Though both share feelings for each other, Callie and Erica react to the blossoming relationship in different ways. While Callie is unsure what the relationship means for her and her sexuality (still enjoying her sex life with men), after a few nights spent with Callie, Erica realizes that she must be gay, though she admits to relationships with men in the past. For Callie, Erica's revelation makes her nervous and sends her running to Sloan for sex, twice in one day, where she finds the chemistry just as good. Though Callie's bisexuality is not necessarily a failure to commit, Erica is hurt by what she sees as a \"grey area\" in the relationship where she would rather have straight answers. She claims \"you can't be kind of a lesbian\" and walks away from Callie and Seattle Grace, having lost her only personal ally.\n\n\nEarly in her time at Seattle Grace, when word was being passed of a \"Gentleman's evening\" planned by the Chief of Surgery to which only the male attendings were invited, Dr. Hahn grilled Dr. Webber on the lack of professionalism of such an event, likening it to the not-so-distant era of racial discrimination. Later in the evening, she crashed their party and beat them at monopoly. Though generally slow to make friends, Erica befriended [[Callie Torres|Callie]], seeing in her a strong woman and also another loner. At roughly the same time, she became friends with [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] when Addison came to visit (although she still had a slight dislike for Mark).\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nShe had a rough relationship with [[Cristina Yang]], consistently denying her the privilege of sucking up, and making her fight her way to stay on the cardio program. Her first day at Seattle Grace, Erica made it clear that personal and professional life would be separate things, telling Cristina \"if you had the chops in the operating room, you wouldn't need to impress in the bedroom\", referencing Cristina's tendency to have relationships with her former teachers. This harsh attitude didn't go unnoticed. Miranda Bailey, noting Hahn's attitude towards Cristina,\uaadvised her to focus on a new surgical specialty (an act of 'reverse psychology' in that by suggesting that she\uachoose something else, Cristina would be more determined to\uastick with cardio and resist Hahn's hostility).\ua\uaDuring her brief visit, Addison witnessed some of Hahn's hostility and asked why she was so closed to Cristina. Hahn then admitted to her that Cristina reminded her of herself when she was younger. [[Richard Webber]] noticed this tendency of Hahn to shut Cristina out, particularly after Cristina was able to perform a life-saving procedure without assistance despite Hahn having taught her virtually nothing. After the surgery Richard confronted Erica, saying that Cristina's work in the OR should have given her reason to celebrate as it showed she was doing her job effectively. However as this clearly was not the case in this instance, he backed Cristina up and insisted that if she wished to remain in the hospital\uashe would have to improve her teaching methods and not destroy the spirits of her residents. As a\uaresult, Erica made an effort to reevaluate her professional technique. Outside the hospital Hahn was equally hostile to Cristina; while Hahn and Meredith helped Callie and Cristina move into their new apartment, Hahn remained as unpleasant toward Cristina as ever.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nAlthough originally taking a liking to her, Erica disliked [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] strongly after discovering that Izzie had been the root of the cause behind one of her patient's losing out on an important heart transplant, due to Izzie's relationship with Denny Duquette. Though generally emotionally detached, Dr. Hahn is indignant at the unfair treatment to her patient, a good man with kids whose chance was taken away. She was not able to recover from the seemingly personal nature of this attack, to which neither the Chief, the hospital, nor Callie would see her side or come to her defense, one of many causes of her eventual break with the hospital.\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nAlongside Yang, she also maintained a tough edge with\ua[[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]], refusing to operate on [[William George Bailey Jones|Bailey's son]] while she was in the room and calling her a \"blithering idiot\" while in the company of her interns.<ref>[[Forever Young]], x</ref> Bailey was put in charge of producing a team of surgeons to remove an abdominal\ualeiomyosarcoma from a -year-old girl, which has been declared inoperable. The family agreed\uato the surgery only if Hahn was part of the team.\uaFrom the onset, she was overwhelmingly negative, knocking back all suggestions and having no faith that the patient could possibly survive. The surgery was successful and Miranda told Hahn that she deserved no credit for the outcome due to her attitude.\n\nOther residents\nIn comparison to Cristina and Izzie, who both expressed interest in pursuing cardiothoracic surgery as their speciality, Hahn's relationship with the other resident was less clear. However, she did request Meredith to be on her service on the basis of her mother's reputation and on one occasion to replace Cristina. She seemed to\uabe on relatively stable terms\uawith George and Alex even giving the latter a compliment during a complicated surgery on a baby who was born with his heart outside his chest.<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nWhile they respected each other as professionals, Erica and Richard clashed on occasion during her tenure at Seattle Grace. On her first day as head of cardio, Richard called her out on the fact that she had agreed to perform awake heart surgery on a patient who was allergic to anesthesia without consulting him first. Erica was taken aback by this and asked if Burke had been required to do the same. Her hostility was further informed by the fact that Richard had organized a 'gentleman's evening' with Derek and Mark, which Erica considered sexist and comparable to racial discrimination. In the end, the surgery went ahead and Erica attended the evening. In addition to Izzie Stevens, Richard Webber was a catalyst in her abrupt departure from Seattle Grace. Having learned that Izzie was not reported for the Denny Duquette incident, Erica expressed her outrage to Richard, who retaliated angrily, saying that the event did not go unreported. It was reported to ''him'' and he \"dealt with it\" and that Izzie was punished and the matter was closed. Furious, Erica stormed out of the office and left the hospital shortly after realizing that nobody would back her up in any action she planned to take.\n\n\nDr. Hahn is a long-time rival of [[Preston Burke|Dr. Preston Burke]] in the field of cardiothoracic surgery, dating back to their days at [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]], where she graduated second after Burke. She was a cardiothoracic attending surgeon at Seattle Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nAccording to Cristina, Hahn is known amongst her peers for her septal sparing technique, which is employed when performing Ross procedures (known also by the technical term pulmonary autograph).\n\nDr. Stewart from [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] said Erica was the best cardiovascular surgeon he's ever had.\n\nShe and Burke fought over a donor heart, which Burke ultimately won because of faulty information from Izzie pertaining to Denny's condition, and she was contacted for a consult on Harold O'Malley's valve replacement.\n\nShe was considered for the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], but she lost to [[Preston Burke]].<ref>[[The Becoming]], x</ref>\n\n[[File:Ericaleaves.jpg|thumb|right|px|Erica leaves [[Seattle Grace Hospital|SGH]].]]\n\nHahn joined the staff of Seattle Grace Hospital after performing a heart transplant at the request of Chief Richard Webber. As such, she became [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Seattle Grace and appropriately dubbed \"The New Burke\". She left the hospital following the revelation that Izzie was not ever truly punished for what happened with [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]].\n\n\n*She did sunrise yoga with [[Callie Torres|Callie]].<ref>[[Piece of My Heart]], x</ref>\n*She claims to have never lost a dart game.\n*She needed to wear glasses as a kid.\n**The fact that she does not wear them as an adult may mean that she wears contact lenses, or, like [[Stephanie Edwards]], had laser eye surgery.\n\n*Unlike other the cardiothoracic surgeons in the show, Hahn's departure in [[Rise Up]] was revealed in the [[These Ties That Bind|episode after]].\n*She has the least amount of appearances of any main character, with only  episodes and is also the only main character to not be part of the main cast during an entire season because she was promoted during season four and left during season five.\n**She is also one of the few main characters to appear in every episode during her tenure as a main character.\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nEricaHahn.png\nEricaHahn.png\nEricaHahn.png\nEricaHahn.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Erica-centric or otherwise very informative about her life.\n*[[Kung Fu Fighting]]\n*[[The Becoming]]\n*[[Rise Up]]\n\n\n:'''Erica:''' This is like needing glasses.\n:'''[[Callie Torres|Callie]]:''' I\uve blinded you?\n:'''Erica:''' When I was a kid, I would get these headaches, and I went to the doctor, and they said that I needed glasses.

However, the EGD revealed a large tumor, which the doctors determined to be adenocarcinoma. His diet caused severe acid reflux, which made his esophagus the perfect breeding ground for cancer.

As an intern, George got off to a rough start but quickly became a very skilled and talented surgeon. He was best friends with Izzie Stevens. He was married to [[Callie Torres]] but divorced after he cheated on her. He was kind-hearted, compassionate, and loyal. He died after jumping in front of a bus to save [[Amanda|a woman's life]].\n\n\n\nAs a child, he was teased by a neighbor, Mike Wilden. Eventually, he snapped and hit Mike's face with a stick. When Mike's father later came over and yelled at George's father, [[Harold O'Malley|Harold]] asked George if it was true. When George denied it, Harold and Mike's father got into a big fight. Harold believed George because he thought he never lied. As a result of the fight, Mike's family threw eggs at George's house and [[Ronny O'Malley|Ronny]] and [[Jerry O'Malley|Jerry]] blew up their lawn mower.\n\nIn school, George was a mathlete. He won a blue ribbon in science for dissecting a fetal pig and was secretary and treasurer of the ''Dungeons and Dragons'' club, which is another example of his difference from his brothers.\n\nHe asked a girl out to prom and she said yes. He was surprised since she was cooler than he was. On the night of the prom, he got his dad's car for the night and rented the most expensive tux he could afford. He and his date enjoyed the prom until there was an after-party that they were supposed to go to. As they were driving, she asked him to go to the local college and it turned out that she wanted him to drop her off at her boyfriend's dorm. He dropped her off and even waited to make sure that she arrived okay.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nHe went to medical school at the School of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\n[[File:xElevatorSurgery.jpg|thumb|xpx|George operates in the elevator.]]\nWhen George was an intern, he and Alex were treating a GSW (Gun Shot Wound) patient. They were in the elevator with him and it broke down. Burke squeezed some supplies through the elevator so they could perform the surgery and talked George through the steps. Alex was too scared to do it, although he never admitted it, and later he was made fun of because he chickened out. George successfully completed the procedure in the elevator and saved the patient's life.\n\n\nGeorge had a dislocated shoulder, and came to an orthopedic surgeon. Her name is Callie. She reduced George's shoulder. Later in the day, Callie and George met up and Callie wrote her number on George's hand. He called her, but hung up every time because he was nervous.\n\n\nGeorge's father told him before his death to be with Callie. Shortly after his death, George then proposed to Callie (later admitting he did so because she said she loved him and it was his father's dying wish for George to be with Callie). They got married in Vegas and George had a hard time as the other interns, especially Izzie, thought he made a mistake by marrying her.\n\nCallie was suspicious of George and Izzie's friendship and told George that she thought Izzie was in love with him. After this fight, George went to see Izzie and the two got very drunk and slept together. George felt extremely guilty for cheating on Callie but ultimately decided he was in love with Izzie, not Callie. Callie suspected George was having an affair and both Mark and Addison encouraged Callie to act on her suspicions.\n\nLater, George told Callie that he slept with Izzie.\n\n\nGeorge failed his exam because he had been distracted by all of his life problems on the day of the exam. He was trying to help Meredith with her problems with Derek and the death of her mother.\nGeorge had to retake his intern year, he was one of Meredith's interns. George tried to keep the fact he was retaking a secret from the other interns and was doing well with the help of his fellow intern Lexie Grey, but Alex told all of the other interns that were praising him that they really shouldn't because he is really a repeater. \n\n\nGeorge intended to transfer to [[Mercy West Medical Center|Mercy West]] after his internship. After failing his intern exam, George needed to repeat his intern year at Seattle Grace. As a repeat intern, George became popular among the new interns and eventually became the Chief's intern (a job that [[Richard Webber|Chief Webber]] made up for George). Soon, he and [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]], whom he moved in with after his break-up with Callie, discovered that he only failed his exam by one point. George then confronted the [[Richard Webber|Chief]] and asked to be allowed to retake the exam early. He passed and became a resident.\n\n\nGeorge had a complicated relationship with Izzie. They were best friends and roommates. He and Stevens shared many fond memories together such as talking about his crush and about \"Jimmy and the twins.\"\nGeorge slept with Izzie and they both admitted that they were in love with one another, their romantic relationship ended George's marriage with Callie. However, they had a short lived romantic history, which broke off eventually.\n\n\n\n\nAfter he joined the army to be a trauma surgeon, Richard gave him the last day in the hospital off to spend time with his family. On his way home, George jumped in front of a bus to save [[Amanda|a woman's]] life. No one knew who he was because he was unrecognizable until Meredith went into check on \"John Doe.\ud George took her hand and traced ''. Meredith quickly figured out that it was, in fact, George. Many people didn't believe that it was George because there was no proof that he really did trace . [[Callie Torres]] remembered that George had a birthmark on his hand that looked like Texas, so she went to check and found his birthmark on his hand. His brain swelled during surgery and he was ultimately declared brain dead. Most of his organs were donated following the surgery.\n\nHe was mentioned again when his mother was admitted to Seattle Grace Mercy West following a botched operation at another hospital. It is during her surgery that Miranda Bailey admitted to Meredith that George was her favorite intern.\n\n\nDay of the Dead\nGeorge was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nInside Meredith's Visions\nWhen Meredith was diagnosed with COVID-, she began to slip in and out of consciousness, often waking up on a beach. On a lifeguard tower on the beach Meredith meets George and the two reflect on George's death and their residency. Later Meredith told George how he affected and changed her life.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\n\nGeorge was compassionate and kind. During his early years, he spent his time camping with his father and his brothers hunting turkeys, although George refused to kill one every single year. George was often teased by his brothers due to his apparent lack of masculinity.\n\nHe was also very emotionally attached to his dog Bucky, whom he thought had run away, not knowing that his father accidentally ran over and killed the dog after he was chasing after the truck and got caught under the tire. His father, knowing that George would be devastated, lied to him.\n\nGeorge O'Malley loved his friends and was always there for them. He was a loyal friend and he was always ready for anything, even if at first he doubted himself. He was passionate about his job and he enjoyed helping people whenever he could.\n\n\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\n[[File:xGizzie.jpg|thumb|left|px|George and Izzie become friends immediately.]]\ue\n\nAs Cristina and Meredith quickly became friends and the other interns disliked Alex, George and Izzie quickly made friends and soon became best friends. Together they realized that they only watched and they needed to become \"doers\". Their friendship remained strong, although George disliked her relationship with Alex. After George slept with Meredith, he moved out and blamed Izzie. While treating a patient, they became best friends again, and their patient told George that he and Izzie argued so much because they cared about each other so much. George moved back into the house, which made Izzie happy (although she strongly disliked his girlfriend, [[Callie Torres]]). Izzie made fun of Callie constantly, especially when she found out Callie's middle name was Iphegenia. After seeing the ring George got Callie, she said, \"Tiny diamonds are great because you know what? No one will ever try to steal it.\" Callie later told George that Izzie acted that way because she loved him.\n\n[[File:GizzieBadSex.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Izzie realize that it isn't the right time for them and stay friends.]]\nAfter an argument, George left to ask Izzie for her support. They started drinking heavily and woke up the next day after having sex. Only Izzie remembered but after a while, George did too. He decided to pretend it never happened and didn't tell Callie. However he and Izzie shared another kiss and on Cristina's wedding day she told him that she would support him and Callie if he loved her but that she still loved him. After eighteen days of ignoring her, George told Izzie he wanted to be with her too but he needed to break up with Callie first. It took a while but eventually he told Callie he slept with Izzie. However, she misunderstood him and forgave him and took him back. He and Callie divorced later and Izzie and George started up a relationship. However, after failing to recreate the great sex they had before, they decided that although they had great chemistry it wasn't the right time. They decided to stay friends and maybe have a romantic relationship someday. When Izzie started seeing Denny, George was the first to notice something was wrong but she denied any accusations. George took it hard when Izzie told Cristina about her cancer before him. He started to avoid her but almost immediately he befriended her again. He supported her through her cancer, reminding her she was a doer. When George was rushed into a surgery and Izzie started to flatline, in a dream of some sort she went into an elevator and then saw George when the doors opened signifying his death.\n\n[[Callie Torres]]\n[[File:O'Callie.jpg|thumb|left|px|The newly-weds, Callie and George]]\nAfter his disastrous incident with Meredith, George focused on avoiding her. However, he fell down the stairwell at Seattle Grace and went to ortho to get his arm fixed. He met Callie and she gave him her phone number. He didn't call her for a while so Callie refused to speak with him. However he soon called and she forgave him. They began dating, much to the disapproval of Izzie. At the prom, Callie confessed to George that she loved him, but he didn't respond, as Izzie needed him for an emergency. George later told her that he didn't love her yet, but he could, and he didn't want to say it until he really meant it. However, George continued to leave Callie whenever Izzie or Meredith had a problem, which prompted Callie to break up with him and start sleeping with Mark Sloan. After discovering that Callie was sleeping with Sloan he refused to have any relationship with her. But they grew close again when George's father was admitted, and they kissed. After George's father died, George became addicted to sex to forget about his pain, and later he proposed to Callie. They flew to Las Vegas, and after two weeks they returned to Seattle Grace as a married couple.\n\nAfter speaking with his friends, George became worried that he made the wrong decision but eventually decided that he did make the right choice. However, after a fight with Callie, he went to visit Izzie. They got drunk and had sex, but George believed it was a mistake and they should forget what happened. After sharing another kiss with Izzie in an elevator, he decided that he was going to transfer to Mercy West. He and Callie decided to start trying to have a baby, but Izzie told George that she still had feelings for him. After  days of avoiding her, he decided he wanted to be with her so told Callie about the affair. She misunderstood and forgave him and took him back but the situation was cleared up and they decided to divorce. After the divorce, they remained friends.\n\n\n[[Image:O'MalleyFamily.png|thumb|left|px|George's family (minus his father).]]\n[[Harold O'Malley|Harold]] and [[Louise O'Malley]]\nHe loved his parents very much. After his father died, he said he would've given his heart to him.\n\n[[Jerry O'Malley|Jerry]] and [[Ronny O'Malley]]\nGeorge never got on well with his brothers. His brothers were jocks and he was a mathlete. However, they still protected him when they felt they had to. When the O'Malley family fought with the Wilden family, Ronny and Jerry blew up the Wilden's lawnmower for George. Every year at Thanksgiving, the brothers and their father would hunt turkeys. George refused to shoot the turkey but after years of refusing, George eventually gave in so that he could go back home and stop having to \"choose a car\". After hearing that George only assisted in surgeries, his brothers refused to call him a \"real doctor\" and often made fun of him. Overall, George is very different from his brothers.\n\n\n[[Lexie Grey]]\n[[File:Crapartment.jpg|thumb|right|px|Lexie steals for George.]]\nAfter being separated from his class, George befriended Lexie. Lexie became like a best friend to George, and they even rented an apartment together. However, the apartment was awful, so in an attempt to get George to stay at their \"crapartment\", Lexie began stealing things from the hospital. George stayed and they grew closer but he got mad at her after she revealed that he only failed his exam by one point. However, Lexie's snooping managed to get George another chance at taking his intern exam and in a rush of excitement, he kissed her and she realized she had feelings for him. She continued to stay his friend, secretly loving him, but after becoming a resident, he forgot about Lexie and all her help so she refused to speak to him. George realized she liked him, but after she forgave him, she started to take an interest in Mark instead, so they remained friends.\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nGeorge and Cristina had lots of problems with their friendship. Cristina always treated George like a child and eventually called him \"\" and \"Bambi\". George was also one of the first to find out about Burke and Cristina's relationship. When George moved in with the two of them, she walked around the apartment naked once and Burke kicked George out.\n\nThings got worse when Burke was shot and received surgery. After the procedure, Burke began to get tremors in his right hand, and in Cristina's attempt to protect Burke, she didn't tell anyone. When George found out, he remembered that Burke was scheduled to operate on his (George's) father. After this point, George and Cristina's relationship worsens. George later explains that the reason he chose Cristina and Burke to operate on his father was that Cristina was a robot, \"a robot in a white coat who never makes a mistake.\" Cristina even tells his mother, Louise, that George is the best intern and a good person, and that his mother raised a good human being.\n\nGeorge was angry at Cristina for hiding Burke's tremor, and when all the interns forgave her, he did not, telling Meredith that she was the one that started calling him , and he didn't owe her any kind of support. When George's father died, at the beginning he was not able to talk to anyone, yet Cristina allowed him to and told him her father also died when she was little and said she was sorry to welcome him to the \"Dead Dad's Club\"; she understood how it felt to be without a father. After this revelation, they seemed to be cordial to each other.\n\nWhen Cristina found out that George signed up for the army, she cared for him, yet she described him as \"the guy who gets killed while cleaning his own gun.\"\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\n[[File:GeorgeMerSTimeOut.jpg|thumb|right|px|George and Meredith apologize during a time-out.]]\nFrom the moment George O'Malley met Meredith, he fell in love with her. Meredith however, was in love with Derek Shepherd so she never really thought about George as more than a friend. Only a patient and George's best friend [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] knew how he felt about Meredith. After a small push from Izzie, George decided to tell Meredith how he felt. Meredith had had a very bad day at work so when George confessed his feelings for her, she thought that maybe George was her guy and she had just overlooked him. They proceeded to kiss but during sex, knowing it wasn't right, Meredith burst into tears. George was humiliated and furious and for weeks he refused to speak to her. Eventually he accepted her apology but admitted that he was partly to blame too, he had known how she felt about [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and knew she didn't love him.\n\nTheir friendship continued and he moved back to her house. When George discovered that he had to repeat his intern year, he drew away from his group of friends but things soon went back to normal and Meredith and George's friendship continued, and was strengthened as she was his resident. On George's last day at Seattle Grace, he was hit by a bus and nobody could recognize him. Meredith was his doctor and although she didn't communicate with him often, she defended him in front of some of the other doctors and after he traced the word \"[[]]\" on her hand, she realized it was him and had him rushed into the [[Operating Room|O.R.]]\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nEver since the start of their internship, Alex has disliked George. On their first day as interns, George was given the name  (when he froze in his first surgery) by Alex and it was the start of their mutual dislike for each other. Later on, George learned that he had contracted syphilis from his girlfriend Olivia. George was given the name \"Syph-boy\" by Cristina but soon learned that Alex was the person that gave syphilis to Olivia, which lead to Alex being punched by George. And on a different occasion, when Alex told George that Callie had slept with Mark Sloan, George went into denial and got into another fight with him.\n\nAlex repeatedly and frequently pointed out George's flaws - calling him weak and pathetic more than once - but Alex later revealed that he actually respected George and that if he were still alive then he would have beaten all the other residents at each milestone (st solo surgery, chief resident, etc.). Professionally, George had beaten Alex during important situations, even though Alex was better at poaching surgeries, George would have been better at dealing with emergency cases while Alex would just have frozen (e.g. heart in the elevator). Later, when George's mother returned, which brings back memories of George, Alex revealed to Cristina and Meredith that he didn't like to think of George because it reminded him of Izzie (his ex-wife) which brought pain.\n\nOver the years, Alex\us views on George softened. When Meredith, Callie, and Alex were discussing all of the different doctors that lived in Meredith's house, George was brought up and Alex made a somber toast in his honor, showing that he truly did see him as a friend.\n\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nIn the beginning, Miranda Bailey didn't care much for George. She treated him the same as any other intern, but after George helped deliver [[William George Bailey Jones|her baby]] when she was going through a rough time; she gained so much respect and gratitude for him. She even named her child after him, giving him the middle name George. Although there was never a strong friendship, they gained a bond beyond professional. When Miranda heard George had signed up for the army, she, along with Callie, tried her best to convince him not to go. When George died, she suffered a great loss. Later, when George's mother came to [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] for a surgery, Miranda wanted to make sure she got the best possible treatment. During surgery, Miranda revealed to Meredith that George was her favorite intern and was very saddened by his death, showing that she cared a tremendous amount for George O'Malley.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nSince George failed his first intern exam, Richard was more interested in the potential and knowledge that George had. Richard often gave guidance to George and helped him through many of his surgeries. After George passed away, Richard was very moved and sad. In a conversation with [[Derek Shepherd]], he let him know that he was teaching George so Derek could later take over for him as Chief of Surgery of Seattle Grace.\n\n[[Owen Hunt]]\nWhen Owen and George were operating, Owen immediately saw that George had talent for [[Trauma Surgery]]. Eventually, Owen focused his teaching on George. Later, behind the scenes, Owen told George that he should join the army, and that George is going to be one of the finest trauma surgeons he's ever known. George's plans were stopped in their tracks, however, when he got hit by a bus and died in surgery.\n\nWhen he realized that George was brain-dead, Owen asked Chief Webber if he was a donor, since he could save many lives.\n\n[[Preston Burke]]\nUpon first meeting George, Burke disliked him. George accidentally offended him and Burke chose George to be the intern he punished a lot which would force the others to fall in line. He allowed George to scrub in with him on his first day and insulted and terrified him. However, after working on more cases, George and Burke grew to have a friendship and Preston christened George his \"guy.\ud When George moved out of Meredith's house and had nowhere to go, Burke allowed him to sleep at his apartment. They went running together and acted like a team constantly. Eventually, Cristina managed to get George to move out but he and Burke remained friends, even after he left Cristina on their wedding day.\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nGeorge initially disliked Shepherd because of the latter's relationship with Meredith. During his neurosurgery rotation, he called out on the anesthesiologist Dr. Taylor after smelling alcohol in his breath but was dismissed by Shepherd. When Dr. Taylor fell asleep during surgery, Shepherd promptly kicked him out. After the surgery, Derek commended George for speaking up and admitted that he, as the main surgeon and attending in charge, was at fault for failing to notice Dr. Taylor's breath.\n\nGeorge died on Shepherd's operating table. Shepherd had saved him the first time but he coded the second time as his injuries were too extensive.\n\n[[Sadie Harris]]\nGeorge didn't have a close relationship with Sadie. He also didn't understand how Meredith could be friends with her. During the intern bowl, he noticed Sadie didn't have the basic medical knowledge for her level. He also caught her cheating to win. George offered her assistance, but at the end, he gave her an ultimatum that he would tell the chief or she would have to. After that, Sadie quit and called George an \"ass.\ud\n\n[[Erica Hahn]]\nWhile not known for being friendly towards interns and residents, Erica Hahn did not seem to treat George any differently from other interns and residents. She did not seem to have a problem with him being in her O.R. Before starting her employment as head of cardiothoracic surgery at Seattle Grace, George 'hired' her to operate on his father as he knew of Preston Burke's tremor following his gunshot wound. Despite clashing with George during her tenure as his father's surgeon, she did not appear to hold this against him during her time at SG. George managed to talk two of Hahn's reluctant patients into having surgery. Hahn was [[Haunt You Every Day|called to]] Seattle Grace to harvest a heart from a brain-dead car accident victim whose father was in the hospital awaiting a heart transplant. He refused to take his daughter's heart. However, he agreed after George told him he would have donated his heart to his father if it would have saved him. George later also talked a frightened -year-old into having heart surgery after showing him the inside of an O.R. so he would know how things worked in there and would no longer be scared. While Hahn originally refused, she eventually consented to the plan.[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|xpx|George holds a dress for Mark.]]\n[[Mark Sloan]]\nMark Sloan disliked most interns and George was no exception. After George and Callie divorced, Mark decided to humiliate George for Callie so when two patients were admitted in a competition which involved holding a wedding dress, Mark ordered George to hold the dress while he treated one of the girls.<ref>[[Kung Fu Fighting]], x</ref> However, at Lexie's request, Sloan vowed that he would become less cruel to O'Malley.\n\n\nAmanda\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|right|ox|Amanda stays with George.]]\nGeorge met Amanda the day before he left to join the army. They met at a bus stop but when he smiled at her and she ignored him, interested in finding better-looking guys, a bus almost hit Amanda. George threw himself under it and pushed her out of the way, saving her life. They were brought to Seattle Grace, George's face unrecognizable and Amanda's arm in a sling. Because nobody knew who the John Doe was, no family was called so Amanda refused to leave his side. She stayed with him as much as possible. Before discovering it was George, Meredith said to him that he ''\"...made a good friend there. Guess thats what happens when you take a bus for someone.\ud''\n\n[[Carlos Torres]]\n[[File:George&Mr.TorresS.jpg|thumb|left|px|Mr. Torres holds George by the neck.]]\nWhen Mr. Torres first met George, he mistrusted him because he assumed that George had married Callie for her money. It didn't help that George was hungover. Callie, her father, and George met at Joe's bar where they discussed finance and how George apparently talked too much. However, when Mr. Torres started talking about giving them money, George refused it having just remembered sleeping with Izzie the previous night. Mr. Torres later approached him and told him that he just wanted to protect his daughter and warned George not to hurt her. Months later after George and Callie's divorce, Mr. Torres came to visit his daughter at Seattle Grace. When he spotted George he pushed him up against a wall and threatened to kill him for cheating on Callie but Callie told her father that she had cheated on him with Mark too. Mr. Torres dropped George who ran away and grabbed Mark Sloan instead.\n\n\nHe attended [[Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine]].\n\nWhen George applied to become an [[Internship|intern]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]], he barely made it into the program (although George later discovered he had the most, and best, recommendation letters). During the beginning of his internship, he was picked by Dr. [[Preston Burke]] to perform the first surgery of all the interns. During the surgery, he almost killed the patient and earned the nickname \"\" (after James Bond's License to Kill). Later in their intern year, George and [[Alex Karev]] get stuck in an elevator with a patient who has been shot. The patient begins to bleed out and when Alex freezes up, Burke has to talk George through surgery and George \"flies solo\" for the first time.\n\nAt the end of his intern year, George failed his intern exams. By the time the summer ended, George seemed to have changed his mind and went ahead with repeating his internship with Meredith as his resident.\n\nInitially, none of the new interns knew that George was a repeat intern. Lexie kept his secret and stayed by his side as a friend when all of the other interns find out about it. He moves in with her and starts accepting and living with what he has, befriending the other interns and hosting a party at their ugly apartment (or as they called it, ''[[The Crapartment|crapartment)]]''. It was later revealed that George failed the intern exam by only  point and received  outstanding letters of recommendation, making him and Lexie doubt his repeated internship even more. During a brief outburst at the chief, George is allowed to retake the intern exam. When he comes home to Lexie, they share a brief celebratory kiss although just as friends (although Lexie looked hopeful for more). George finally passes his intern exam, after a little difficulty from a hospital flooding and after a little friction with his interns, he became as qualified as the rest and as Izzie tells him he is the best, putting the most time into teaching and hours in the skill lab.\n\nOwen Hunt joins the hospital, he notices George's talent in trauma surgery and urges him to choose Trauma as his specialty. After connecting with a patient from Iraq, who like himself, had a family completely different from him, George decided to go to be commissioned as a medical officer in the Army and serve in Iraq.\n\nAfter telling the Chief of his decision, he was given the day off to spend some time with his family before he left, preventing an intervention by Bailey, Callie, Meredith, Cristina, Izzie, and Alex. The same day, a patient was admitted after jumping in front of a bus to save a woman, his face unrecognizable with severe injuries to his left arm, head, face, pelvis, and abdomen. Meredith was the resident assigned to the case and remained with the patient, and he attempted to communicate with her using his hand due to him being intubated. The second attempt to communicate with Meredith, he wrote down the numbers '''' for her. Initially confused, Meredith realized that it was George writing his nickname. She got up and told all the other doctors. George was rushed into surgery while Izzie coded. In some sort of afterlife, dream, or hallucination, the two met, Izzie in her prom dress and George in an army uniform.\n[[File:GeorgeinUniform.jpeg|thumb|George in his army uniform.|xpx]]\n\n\n*He was the first main character to perform a surgery, to call time of death, and to inform a relative about a patient's death.\n*He and Lexie nicknamed their apartment ''[[The Crapartment]]''.\n*He had a freckle in the shape of Texas on his right hand.<ref>[[Good Mourning]], x</ref>\n*George could play the clarinet.\n*He had a Catholic background.\n*In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, [[Shonda Rhimes]] had said that she requested [[T.R.

While an intern, her resident was [[Izzie Stevens]] until reassigned to [[George O'Malley]].\n\n\n\nOn her first day of internship, she was assigned to [[Izzie Stevens]], who took the group on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules. Her interns viewed her as the dud, having heard that she'd spent some time on probation after killing someone.\n\nAfter they spent the day saving a deer with Izzie, she said that they were the dud interns.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nClaire, Graciella, Leo, and Mitch all attended a housewarming party thrown by George and Lexie. They all ended up coming to work drunk the next day. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nThe night after the party, the interns planned a darts tournament. When George invited Izzie, they started considering dropping out because they didn't want to play darts with their boss. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural as practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella was affected by George's death. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program. She survived the first round of layoffs. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella participated in a documentary someone made about the doctors at the hospital. During the documentary, she went through two different relationships and decided to rethink her approach. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella was locked down in peds when [[Gary Clark]] brought a gun to the hospital. She informed [[Arizona Robbins]] and [[Callie Torres]] when [[Ruby Kendall|Ruby Kendall's]] appendix burst. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Pierce Halley]]\nShe and Pierce dated for two weeks after Megan left him. She broke up with him when she saw him talking to Megan. He was unaffected by the news. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n[[Charles Percy]]\nShe developed a crush on Charles after dumping Pierce. They hung out at the bar together, but he made it clear they were just friends. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nGraciella was one of the many interns who befriended George and went to his intern parties. She was also one of the many that knew Lexie loved George.\n\nShe and [[Steve Mostow]] are best friends. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nShe originally disliked Izzie, calling her a \"dud\" resident. When Izzie came back to work, Graciella was much nicer, claiming that her mother's church prayed for Izzie. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nDr. Guzman originally worked as an [[Internship|intern]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She worked as an intern first for Izzie and then for George. She was part of the secret intern society but when the interns were about to operate on Sadie, she left as she felt scared.\n\nWhen Izzie was debating which intern to give to George, she said \"''Graciella charts like crap. But she can put in a line''\".\n\nDr. Guzman became a second year [[Resident|resident]] and survived the first round of lay-offs when [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] merged with [[Mercy West Medical Center]].\n\n\n*Graciella was originally credited as ''Graziella''.\n*Graciella is religious.<ref>[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]], x</ref>\n*She doesn't chart well, but she can put in a line.<ref>[[There's No 'I' in Team]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nInternGraciella.png|[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\nInternGraziella.png|[[Let the Truth Sting]]\nInternGraziella.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\nInternGraziella.png|[[Piece of My Heart]]\nInterns.png|[[Here Comes the Flood]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Brave New World]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Rise Up]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[These Ties That Bind]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[In the Midnight Hour]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[All By Myself]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Wish You Were Here]]\nInterns.png|[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Before and After]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[An Honest Mistake]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\nInternGraciella.png|[[Elevator Love Letter]]\nxMeganGraciella.png|[[Good Mourning]]\nxGraciellaClaire.png|[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\nxGraciellaGuzman.png|[[Invasion]]\nxGraciellaGuzman.png|[[Sanctuary]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Graciella Guzman Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Graciella Guzman]]\n[[fr:Graciella Guzman]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guzman, Graciella}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Webisode Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

The O'Malley patriarch was a truck driver with a passion for vintage cars. He died at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] due to multi-system organ failure.\n\n\n\nEvery year, Harold took his three sons out hunting to shoot a turkey. When he was an intern, Harold insisted that it would be George's year to shoot the turkey. While they were out in the woods, the others started trading cars, but George didn't participate. They believed it was because he didn't know anything about cars, but he explained that it was always the same conversation over and over again and he was tired of it. George ultimately did shoot the turkey, but as they were packing up, one of them accidentally shot Harold in the butt. George took him to the hospital where he removed the birdshot and stitched him up. ''(\"[[Thanks for the Memories]]\")''\n\nIn addition to taking his sons turkey hunting every Thanksgiving, Harold also took the boys on camping trips to White River at least once a month. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\n\nHarold was brought to the hospital, where [[Callie Torres]] treated him. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\nHe had passed out, fallen, and broken his clavicle. Callie said his clavicle would be fine, but he was complaining of abdominal pain, so they scheduled an endoscopy. The endoscopy showed that Harold had esophageal cancer that had spread to his stomach. He was told he'd need surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation to treat it. His EKG showed abnormalities, so they looked at his heart and found out that he had a leaking aortic valve. He needed to have his valve replaced before they could start treating the cancer. George insisted that Burke do the valve replacement, because he's the best. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nHowever, after becoming suspicious about Burke's hand, George talked to [[Erica Hahn]] and hired her to do his father's valve replacement. When Harold and Louise heard, they wondered why George would want Erica to do the surgery instead of Burke. After talking to Izzie about the switch, they decided to go back to having Burke do his surgery. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nThe day of his surgery, Harold went into V-tach and had to be given lidocaine. He was then taken in to have his valve replaced and it went well. ''(\"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\")''\n\nAfter his heart surgery, Harold said he felt better than ever, so his extended family came to visit and have a bit of a party before he started cancer treatment, figuring he wouldn't be feeling up to visitors after starting treatment.\n\nBefore his initial cancer surgery, which was mostly exploratory, Harold met with an oncologist, who said they might not complete the surgery if they saw that the tumor had invaded other organs. He asked them to remove all the tumor, no matter what, saying O'Malleys are fighters and he could fight it. Richard agreed to do so.\n\nIn surgery, they discovered that the tumor had spread, but they abided by Harold's wishes and removed as much of the tumor as they could.\n\nAfter surgery, the big concern was multi-system organ failure. George monitored his kidneys as those would be the first to go, but his kidney function was good. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, he was intubated. The tube kinked and had to be replaced, but because of the swelling in his throat, putting in a new tube was difficult. His family was warned ahead of time that they might not be able to place a new tube and he'd die. It took Bailey a few tries to intubate, but she was able to get a new tube in.\n\nShortly after that, his urine output started to decline as his kidneys failed. His other organs started to fail and his family was informed that he was entirely dependent on his life support machines. They were given the choice to keep him on life support and allow nature to take its course or they could take him off life support. They chose to take him off life support after asking George, who said that Harold was in pain. They removed the tube and stayed with him while he died. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe was married for  years (since he was ) to his wife, Louise, and took great pride in all his sons.\n\n\nHarold was close with Ronny and Jerry. His bond with George was more distant and they struggled to understand each other, but still loved each other.\n\n\nHarold was a truck driver.

She was a surgical resident at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] until she was fired shortly after the merger with [[Mercy West Medical Center]]. Engaged to [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]] until his death, she is now in a relationship with her ex-husband, [[Alex Karev]]. Together, they have twins, [[Alexis Stevens|Alexis]] and [[Eli Stevens|Eli]].\n\n\n\nIzzie grew up in Forest Park, on Route , behind a church in Chehalis, Washington.<ref name=\":\">[[Break on Through]], x</ref> She lived in a trailer park with her [[Robbie Stevens|mother]] who nicknamed her \"Cricket\"<ref>[[Save Me]], x</ref> Sometimebefore her residency, her maternal grandmother died of thyroid cancer.<ref name=\":\" />\n\nAs a teenager, Izzie worked as a waitress and had savings for college, but her mother spent most of the saved money on psychics. This forced Izzie to pay most of the bills with her own money. \n\nAt age fifteen, Izzie became pregnant.<ref>[[New History]], x</ref> She gave birth to a baby girl and placed her for adoption at sixteen in order to give her a better life. She secretly named the girl Sarah, but her parents named her [[Hannah Klein|Hannah]].<ref name=\":\" /> Because of her pregnancy, mothers made their children stay away from Izzie so she struggled to make friends.\n\nAt her high school prom, the football quarterback was her date. Since her school didn't have a lot of money, they just converted the gym.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n\nWhen she turned eighteen, she left home. She paid for medical school by modeling designer \"[[Bethany Whisper]],\" which led to her receiving the nickname \"Dr. Model.\"<ref>[[No Man's Land]], x</ref>\n\nShe attended the [[University of Washington School of Medicine]].\n\n\nIzzie started out as an intern at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] under fourth-year resident [[Miranda Bailey]], alongside [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], and [[George O'Malley]]. She and George soon became Meredith's roommates.\n\n[[Alex Karev]] was later reassigned as Miranda's resident.\n\n\nIzzie developed a strong relationship with Alex, but was subsequently mocked for it.\n\nAlex took Izzie out on a date, but Izzie was insulted that he wasn't acting like himself and he didn't bother to kiss her goodnight, not knowing that Alex felt \"off his game\" because he heard that he failed his boards. Izzie was annoyed at Alex for ruining the date and not kissing her until Alex went to Joe's and kissed her passionately. This sparked their first relationship, though Alex still struggled to become intimate with Izzie. \n\nLater, Izzie saw Alex and [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]] having sex in an on-call room, devastating her. When Alex was studying for his boards, Izzie finally broke down in front of him as she tried to help him study. Eventually, she was able to forgive Alex, and they were on friendly terms again.\n\nTheir feelings for each other started to spark again after Izzie and Alex had sex for the first time following the bomb in the body cavity incident. They were on the brink of a second go at a relationship when [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]] returned to the hospital, re-igniting Izzie's interest in him.\n\n\nIzzie met Denny, a cardio patient, who immediately took a liking to Izzie. As time went on, the two got closer to the point that they fell in love with each other. Still, Denny needed a new heart, only alive due to his [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]].\n\nA heart became available, but when the heart donor flat-lined, Burke and Alex attempted to take [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Hahn's]] heart in order for Denny to receive a heart that day. However, Hahn's transplant patient had been put on the donor list  seconds before Denny. Knowing the only way that Denny would get the heart would be if his condition worsened immediately, Izzie cut Denny's LVAD wire so that this would happen. Upon arrival at Seattle Grace, Burke was shot and Hahn was needed to do the surgery. While the surgery was completed successfully, Denny soon after died from an unexpected stroke.\n\nAfter Denny died, Izzie confessed to Chief Webber that she cut the LVAD wire, but she felt she was no longer a doctor. She quit the program. After some time mourning Denny, endlessly baking and a visit from [[Miranda Bailey]], Izzie started to heal. Initially intending to clean out her locker, Izzie watched Cristina stitching up a heart from the gallery. This reignited her passion for medicine, and she returned to Seattle Grace. The Chief put her on probation, with Dr. Bailey adding extra punishments such as only observing and no talking or interacting with patients. She was eventually taken off of probation after helping a victim of the [[Ferry Boats|ferry boat]] crash.<ref>[[Drowning on Dry Land]], x</ref>\n\nIzzie received an inheritance check from Denny for $.M. She didn't deposit the check for a while, which stressed her roommates out. Finally, Izzie deposited the check but was unsure how to spend it as she wanted Denny's money to go towards something meaningful. When [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] got approval for a free clinic, Izzie realized Denny's money could fund it, and she put almost all of her inheritance towards the new clinic, naming it the [[Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic]]. \n\n\nIzzie became a second-year resident at Seattle Grace after passing her intern exams. Her first day on the job resulted in her treating a deer in the back of a pick-up truck which her new interns thought was ridiculous and a waste of her time.\n\nAs she struggled to get her feet grounded, she became more infatuated with George and his life, practically waiting for his marriage to [[Callie Torres]] to implode. After a bad fight with Callie, George came over to drink with Izzie, and they ended up drunkenly sleeping together. Izzie remembered everything the next morning, but it wasn't until later in the day that their night together came back to George. Both initially agreed to keep it a secret between each other, saying it would never happen again and it didn't mean anything. As time wore on, both Izzie and George realized they did indeed have feelings for each other, and George agreed to tell Callie about his one-night stand. After doing so, Izzie and George attempted a relationship but discovered that their sexual chemistry was non-existent apart from that first night. Their relationship fizzled out, and George moved into an apartment with [[Lexie Grey]].\n\n\n\n\nIzzie started hallucinating her dead fianc\ue, [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette.]] \n\nIzzie discovered that she was misdiagnosed with anemia when she actually had high LDH levels. She went into a private room and started to examine her body for any enlarged lymph nodes or suspicious moles. She then discovered a mole on her back. Izzie and [[George O'Malley]] went to dermatology, [[Daisy Pepman]] removed her mole and told her she shouldn't be worried about it. Daisy later came back with her results that the mole was malignant.. Izzie gathers her interns and creates \"Patient X\" who is actually Izzie, had her interns try to diagnose her. The interns conclude that \"Patient X\" is fine, and at most she has an anxiety disorder. This makes Izzie very frustrated, saying \"Patient X\" has been having visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations. \n\nIzzie is conversing with George when [[Lexie Grey]] comes up to her, explaining they have new on \"Patient X\". Lexie explained they should check for a malignancy in the brain. Which was done by using an MRI. Izzie had multiple scans including an upper G.I., and a head CT before that.The interns later diagnose her with Stage IV metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, brain, and skin, with a % survival rate. Izzie later asked what Lexie would say to \"Patient X\" if she had the chance. Lexie says \"Patient X\"  should screw the odds and argues that her mother died of the hiccups, which probably have a % survival rate.[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|riht|px|Izzie gets treated for her cancer.]]\nIzzie chose to tell Cristina about her cancer, and Cristina set her up with the best surgical oncologist in the state as well as producing masses of research, but Izzie chose to blow off the appointment, making Cristina wonder why she ever confided in her to begin with. Eventually, Cristina couldn't handle the pressure and told an OR full of staff, including Alex and Bailey, of Izzie's diagnosis, which gave Izzie the final push to fight for her life, and she finally admitted herself into Seattle Grace as a patient.\n\nIzzie's first part of her treatment was to have the temporal lobe metastases removed by Derek, who returned to surgery to operate on Izzie following his breakdown. Meredith also suggested to Izzie that she has obstetrics remove healthy eggs from her, for her future. The first stage of her treatment was successful, as Derek removed the tumor fully from Izzie's temporal lobe, no thanks to [[Rebecca Swender]], Izzie's oncologist who constantly second-guessed Derek during surgery until Derek found his rhythm and quiets Dr. Swender.\n\nFollowing the news of her cancer and Meredith and Derek's wedding, she began to plan the wedding and even created [[Meredith and Derek's Wedding Website]]. However, after discovering another tumor in her brain due to the appearance of Denny, Meredith and Derek gave away their wedding to Izzie and Alex and they got married. She then did the risky surgery, and the tumor was successfully removed.\n[[File:Izziecomesbacktolife.png|thumb|xpx|Izzie's DNR order is ignored and successfully resuscitated.]]\nWhile Alex embraced Izzie after realizing that some of her memory returned, Izzie went limp and her pressure started dropping. Alex called for Cristina, who arrived shortly before Richard Webber and Miranda Bailey arrived and he demanded that they resuscitate her, but Cristina told the others that Izzie signed a DNR. Initially, the other doctors wanted to abide by the DNR, but Richard soon gave in, stating, \"Screw the DNR,\" and started to resuscitate her.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\nDuring the budget cuts at Seattle Grace, Izzie accidentally administered an incorrect dosage of medicine to a patient, causing her not to get a much-needed kidney transplant. This caused Chief Webber to fire her. Thinking [[Alex Karev|Alex]] was partly to blame, Izzie wrote him a letter and left.\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Alex and Izzie say goodbye. ]]\n\nIzzie later returned to Seattle for a final PET scan and to ask Derek to put in a good word for her, so she could get a job in Tacoma and repair things with Alex. Derek learned that Tacoma didn't want to hire her because of her history, but he planned on hiring Izzie back once he was given the job of Chief of Surgery. At the same time, Izzie went to show Alex that her scan was clean, meaning she was officially not dying of cancer. He was genuinely happy for her but felt he deserved better. Knowing she was okay, he told her to leave, be happy, and not come back. Realizing that there was nothing left to repair, Izzie went to Meredith's house to pack her stuff. Meredith begged her not to throw the people that loved her aside and not to leave, as it was her home. Izzie responded saying that Seattle Grace wasn't her home anymore, that it was just a place she used to work at and she can do that anywhere. This makes a tearful Meredith frown and turn away, letting her go. As Izzie exhales, she is left to start all over again somewhere else.<ref>[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]], x</ref> \n\n\nAround four years after leaving Seattle, Izzie was single and wanted children. Due to chemo for the cancer, she lost the ability to get pregnant, and she used the frozen embryos from before treatment to try and have kids. It was successful and she gave birth to twins, whom she named Eli and Alexis. The three of them live out on the country in Baldwin City, Kansas, where she now works as a surgical oncologist.\n[[File:xIzzieStevens.png|thumb|Alex and Izzie with their twins.]]\nFive years after having twins, Meredith's medical license was in jeopardy. Alex called her to see if she could write a letter of support in the trial. Alex admitted the trial gave him an excuse to call her and see how she was doing many years later. As Alex and Izzie talked, he described it being as if no time had passed between them and felt they left something unfinished. He later learned she had kids, and that in fact the kids were his. He then got on with the trial and went to see her and the kids. He eventually decided to stay with Izzie and their twins to build a life together.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\n\nIzzie always thinks there's some good in people, no matter how bad they are. Her motivations are always for what she believes to be the right thing. She is very optimistic, bubbly, and bright. The first impression she gives is a confident and friendly woman.\n\nShe is also very kind, protective, and often stubborn. She seems to get too emotionally involved in most cases, which she sees as a good thing, although others feel it gets in the way of the medicine.\n\nIzzie is very loyal to all her friends, and in most cases, can be trusted. She likes seeing others happy and is constantly trying to cheer people up. This attitude, however, is not extended to certain individuals. For example, she goes out of her way every chance she gets to belittle and bring down George and Callie after they eloped, eventually breaking the marriage up completely by sleeping with George. During the entire time she knew Callie, Izzie acted like a childish and inappropriate individual; constantly laughing at her and poking fun of intimate details about Callie\us life she had only wanted George to know. She is also a hopeless romantic. She bakes/cleans a lot almost to an obsessive level when she is sad or stressed.\n\nIzzie can often be taken as a meddler when she tries to help people when they do not necessarily ask for help. She can really bring the pain if she believes she has been wronged or hurt emotionally. She can hold a grudge or retaliate when someone tries to take advantage of her kindness and good intentions.\n\n\n\n[[Hank]]\nWhen she started her internship, Izzie was dating the professional hockey player Hank. They soon broke up due to her long working hours and distance.\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nWhen [[Alex Karev]] discovered her history as a model, he didn't waste any time in putting up her lingerie advertisements all over [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Despite the incident, she saw through Alex's shallow, callous exterior and befriended him, to the shock of her friends.\n\nWhen he eventually asked her out, she was disappointed that he didn't have the courage to kiss her. For a while she refused to speak to him until spontaneously at Joe's bar, he kissed her.\n\nDespite dating Alex, a heart patient named Denny Duquette continually flirted with her. It led nowhere and he left the hospital shortly after they met after failing to receive a new heart.\n\n[[File:Alex_izzie_kiss.jpg|thumb|px|Alex and Izzie kiss.]]\n\nDue to some difficulties on Alex's part, their sexual relationship didn't take off. And after Izzie caught Alex sleeping with [[Olivia Jankovic|Nurse Olivia]], she ended their relationship and was furious with him. When Izzie discovered her friends were helping Alex study for his failed boards she blew up at them although she eventually forgave him and helped him study as well. Even though she forgave him she ruled out the possibility of another relationship with him.\n\nWhen there was a bomb scare in the hospital, Izzie felt she needed to do what she wanted before it was too late. She proceeded to have sex with Alex in a linen closet again several times throughout the day. Alex assumed that they were dating again but Meredith told him that they were only sleeping together and Izzie wouldn't ever think of him the same after his incident with [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia]].\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|px|Alex and Izzie get married.]]\n\nLater, Izzie gave [[Alex Karev|Alex]] an ultimatum. She told him either to be the nice guy or the jerk but he couldn't be both. He kissed her and they later decided to go steady. Things went well but Denny began to appear to Izzie and she even had sex with him. Shockingly, it turned out that the appearances of Denny were because of an illness she had.\n\nMeredith and Derek gave their wedding to Izzie after discovering her tumor and she got married to Alex.\n\nIzzie's time with cancer was rough, and it took a toll on her relationship with Alex. After she was fired from SGMW, she left Alex. Eventually, she did come back, wanting to reunite with Alex when she found out her cancer was gone. However, he refused, wanting someone who would stay. Soon afterwards, she sent him divorce papers and he signed them.\n\nWhen Meredith needed letters for her trial, Alex called Izzie, and in their conversation she revealed that she had given birth to twins, using a frozen embryo that she and Alex had saved when she was starting her cancer treatment. He went to Kansas to visit them, decided to stay, and began a life with Izzie and their family.\n\n[[Denny Duquette, Jr.]]\nWhen Denny was readmitted to the hospital after suffering cardiac dysrhythmia, Izzie brushed Alex off so she could tend to Denny. Alex felt threatened by Denny so he told Denny he should back off because he would probably die from heart failure and if he did it would hurt Izzie. When Izzie found out that Alex said this to Denny, she confronted him and he replied that she could not get involved with patients. She later realized that she did not have to settle for Alex.\n[[File:Cutting the LVAD.jpg|thumb|xpx|Izzie cuts Denny's LVAD wire]]\n\nHowever, Denny survived and they grew closer. He had an [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] inserted to keep him alive for longer so he could wait for a heart, but after finding out that Denny had become a DNR (do not resuscitate) patient, Izzie jumped at the chance to get him a new heart. After discovering that he lost a donor heart to someone on the donor list who was ahead of him by  seconds, she implored him to let her cut his [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire so his condition would worsen and he would move up on the donor list. At first, Denny refused because it would end her medical career and he didn't want to steal a heart out of another man's chest but after Izzie broke down crying and begged him, he agreed. Izzie cut Denny's LVAD wire and sought the help of her fellow interns to keep him alive.\nAs the interns struggled to keep Denny alive, Cristina informed them that Denny's surgeon, [[Preston Burke]], was shot and struggling to survive. After hearing the news, Izzie panicked, completely at a loss. In the midst of the chaos, Denny proposed to a shocked Izzie. [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] walked in on the interns and banned them all from any surgeries until the person who cut the LVAD wire confessed. Meanwhile, Alex invited Dr. Erica Hahn to replace Dr. Burke on Denny's heart transplant surgery. Dr. Hahn successfully completed Denny's transplant surgery and when Izzie visited Denny after his transplant she accepted his marriage proposal. Denny died from a stroke shortly thereafter leaving Izzie devastated and lying next to Denny's body. Alex carried her off the bed and told her that the body wasn't Denny and that Denny loved her and he wouldn't want Izzie to do this to herself. After a long period of mourning, Izzie moved on but refused Alex's offer of a relationship.[[Image:x-.jpg|right|thumb|px|Izzie lying with a deceased Denny.]]\n[[George O'Malley]]\nWhen Izzie discovered that George liked Meredith, she encouraged him to tell her. Eventually, he did but after his disastrous sexual encounter with her, he moved out of the house, much to Izzie's disappointment. Despite several attempts, George refuses to tell Izzie where he is currently living. Eventually, he moved back in and frequently had his new girlfriend, [[Callie Torres|Dr. Callie Torres]], over, much to Izzie's dismay. Izzie made it very clear to George that she disapproved of her presence in his life because she considered Callie a freak. After taking multiple jibes, Callie told George it was because Izzie was in love with him.\n\nAfter Callie disclosed the fact that she was somewhat wealthy and was paying most of their bills herself and didn't mind doing so, a hurt George told Meredith, who told Izzie. Izzie used this information when making a snide remark about Callie, knowing it would hit a nerve. Infuriated at his indiscretion, Callie kicked George out of their hotel room after voicing her opinion that Izzie \"had feelings\" for George. Upset and confused, George went to Izzie and Meredith's house with a bottle of bourbon and after getting drunk, Izzie and George slept together. The next day, George had no recollection of their intimacy the previous night and didn't remember until he was having lunch with Callie and her father. George confronted Izzie about it in a linen closet at the hospital and after they almost kissed, George left in a surge of guilt. Later, Izzie wanted to tell Callie but George insisted that it be kept a secret.\n\nWhile dealing with the aftermath of her sexual encounter with George, Izzie was visited by the adoptive parents of the child she had given up years before. Hannah, now , is sick with leukemia and her donor for a bone marrow transplant had died the previous night. Izzie asked if she could meet Hannah, her parents agreed if Hannah wanted to. Izzie agreed to donate bone marrow to save her daughter's life, causing her emotional grief, Dr. Bailey helped Izzie keep her daughter a secret from the other interns and helped her during the beginning of the bone marrow harvest. Hannah's parents informed Izzie that Hannah was tired and maybe Izzie could meet Hannah when she was better. Despite this, Izzie still agreed to donate bone marrow. George noticed Izzie crying earlier and went to find her. He stayed with her for the rest of the harvest, setting aside other emotions. In the recovery room, Izzie confides in George that she has a daughter and says she needs their friendship to survive even though the sex wasn't tragic like the encounter with him and Meredith. George was still conflicted with his feelings for Izzie and his guilt in betraying Callie, he left Izzie crying in the room, only to return once he realized Izzie needed help as a friend. George came with Izzie when she saw her daughter for the first time, noting that [[Hannah Klein|Hannah]] had Izzie's eyes and mouth.\n\n[[Image:x-.JPG|thumb|left|px|right|Izzie, Meredith and George at Christmas.]]\n\nFollowing this, Izzie and George pretended that everything was fine, and continued to spend time together as friends. As Callie became more suspicious, she confronted Izzie and begged her to relinquish George which prompted Izzie to guiltily withdraw from him. She and George both realized they couldn't pretend their sexual encounter never happened, especially because their feelings for each other keep getting in the way. The combination of all these factors leads George to decide to transfer to Mercy West.\n\nAfter George received a letter telling him he'd been accepted to [[Mercy West Medical Center]], pending the results of the intern exam, Izzie tried to convince him not to leave by saying she had no romantic feelings towards him. Izzie later admitted to George that she was in love with him, leaving him speechless.\n\n[[George O'Malley|George]] later admitted he loved Izzie too, despite his strange reaction to her when she confessed her love to him. Their relationship was soon discovered by George's wife, [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and the two got a divorce. After some time, George and Izzie realized that their relationship was not working as they had very little chemistry. They broke up but continued to have a close friendship.\n\n\n[[Robbie Stevens]]\n[[File:xIzziesmom.png|thumb|xpx|Izzie and her mother hug.]]\nWhen Izzie was diagnosed with cancer, her mother Robbie visited the hospital, unaware of how bad the cancer was. Before she left, she said to Izzie that she always knew she was too good for the trailer park. Izzie said she loved her mother, but they work better at a distance.<ref name=\":\">[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]], x</ref> She later went to live with her mother in Chehalis for a few months in the Winter after she left Alex. \n\nGrammy \nHer grandmother had a tumor on her thyroid and eventually died of thyroid cancer.<ref>[[No Good at Saying Sorry (One More Chance)]], x</ref>\n\n\nIzzie quickly befriended her fellow interns, [[Meredith Grey]], [[Cristina Yang]], and [[George O'Malley]]. She bonded fastest with George. After a rough start with Alex, she became friends with him too.\n\nAfter her marriage, Izzie decided to introduce him to her patient friends: Austin, Star, Miguel, Meg, and Alison. Izzie bonded well with [[ Alison Clark|Alison]], who was similar to Izzie. They had similar cancer, age, and treatment plans. On discovering Alison decided against surgery for her brain metastases and discovering the IL- therapy was working, Izzie was torn between having surgery or not. She tried to get the opinion of Alex, Cristina, Meredith, and George. Cristina and Meredith did not agree with the surgery. With IL- therapy, after three months, the mets were gone. Alex said their life together was at stake and eventually urged for the surgery, however. After Alison's death, Izzie signed a DNR and went through surgery. Webber, Bailey and Cristina ignored the DNR order by Izzie and attempted to resuscitate her when she crashed.<ref>[[Now or Never]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Image:Illness.png|thumb|right|px|right|Izzie's (incorrect) test results.]]\nShe attended [[University of Washington School of Medicine]].\n\nAt the beginning of her internship, Izzie struggled with others' assumptions of her as an incompetent doctor, due to the fact that she used to be a lingerie model.\n\nIzzie was a reasonably good doctor but when she cut Denny Duquette's [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire, she was going to be suspended but instead quit. [[Alex Karev]] later convinced [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] to talk to Izzie and make her come back which Bailey succeeded in doing. Bailey convinced the Chief to let her return but with a strict probation which doesn't allow her to have contact with patients and an inferiority to her fellow interns. Izzie became dissatisfied with the limited amount of medical work she could do and frequently tried to push the boundaries of her probation. She even donated most of her money from [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette's]] check to a free clinic where she and Bailey often worked.\n\nDuring an emergency involving a ferry accident, Izzie saved a man's life by drilling burr holes into his skull with an ordinary drill in the field. This prompted an impressed chief to take her off probation and allow her to finish the rest of the procedure by drilling more burr holes but this time with a real high-speed surgical drill.\n\n[[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] told [[Richard Webber]] that Izzie had the potential to be an extremely gifted [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]], one of the best she had seen in years but she was worried because she seemed to get too close to her patients. After using a tactic of assigning Izzie to a patient that would inevitably die, Izzie left obstetrics.\n\n[[File:Off probation.jpg|thumb|left|px|Izzie is off probation.]]\n\nIzzie decided to try going into cardiothoracic surgery but was met by a determined [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], who was also trying to make a career in the same department. She eventually decided that she was not suited for the specialty and stopped pursuing it.\n\nAfter Bailey realized she had too many things to look after, she handed over the keys of the clinic to Izzie, giving it to her.\n\nWhen her interns (and the others) started to dislike being doctors since they were banned from surgery, Izzie set up a competition, won by Lexie. When she realized that Denny appearing was because she was sick, the set up a competition to diagnose patient X. When she discovered that she had cancer and other people started to learn, she finally admitted herself as a patient, she just designed Meredith and Derek's wedding and was quizzed on medical trivia by Bailey.\n\nShe quickly got back on her feet and continued working as a surgeon, although some thought it was too soon and after concerns from Owen Hunt, Derek Shepherd and Alex, Izzie was fired during the merger with Mercy West, although the chief used the standard speech and claimed it was due to budget cutbacks. After this Izzie left a note in Alex's cubby and left him.\n\nShe relocated to Baldwin City, Kansas and became a [[Surgical Oncology|surgical oncologist]].\n\n\n*She is an excellent baker and obsessive cleaner.\n*She can't cook, as revealed when she plans a Thanksgiving dinner for her roommates, relying on internet recipes.\n* She is Catholic.\n* Her glove size is .\n*Izzie says she always chooses the dog piece when she plays Monopoly.\n* She enjoys baking her mother's chocolate cupcakes and finds out the secret ingredient is coconut extract.\n*Izzie only ever sees Denny when she hallucinates, as he is the person she associates most with death.\n*From the original interns, Izzie is the only female one who did not sleep with an attending.

Yet \"[[Break on Through]]\" confirms she is already at least , and ''at least'' over one year and several months have passed, by the time of \"[[Good Mourning]]\" (x) (set before this would-be birthday timeframe). Therefore, it is certain the OR board date of birth, a brief visual cameo, was an error by production.

Whenever Jackson was brought into [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]], Dr. Kenley would contact Bailey, who had a good relationship with the family.\n\nWhen Jackson was admitted for the final time [[Alex Karev]] was on his case too. After Dr. Kenley died from a heart attack he tried to get Alex to sign a form from the wish people. Alex refused because he wasn't dying. Later he asked [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] to help with the \"stars and x's\" but Alex interrupted them and informed her Jackson was fake dying.\n\nTo replace Kenley, [[Arizona Robbins]] was put on his case but she strongly disagreed with Kenley's treatment plan, so she told Bailey they would try it for one more day. It failed, so they put him on a transplant list for both intestines and a liver. After Bailey spoke to them about the change in his treatment, Alex relented and signed his paper for the wish people. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\nThe next day, Bailey noticed that his BP was down and encouraged Arizona to let her call UNOS in the hopes that they could push him up a few steps, but Arizona said they'd find the organs when they found the organs. Bailey later suggested finding a pediatric GI to do a TIPS procedure on him. As they fought about that, Alex came in and announced they'd found organs for him. Alex and Arizona went to retrieve the organs and went to transplant them, but in surgery, [[Sadie Harris]] noticed a black spot, meaning the organs were dead. They did a portacaval shunt to buy a little time and closed. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\")''\n\nHe was moved to the top of the transplant list and they started trying to keep his brain from swelling as much as possible. They found out there was a liver dialysis machine in the hospital, so they hooked him up to that to give him some more time. Despite the dialysis, his ICP continued to rise and his mother begged him to keep fighting.\n\nWith no new organs, Melinda had to say goodbye to her son and let him go. Melinda started to say her goodbyes, but stopped and Jackson was rushed to surgery after hearing that George and Webber had found an organ donor in the hospital.

Bailey]]\n}}\n'''Joe''' is the owner of the [[Emerald City Bar]], across from the [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital|hospital]], where the doctors often go for a drink after work.\n\n\n\nHe was born and raised in [[Seattle]], Washington.\n\nJoe, and another child, Larry, were always in competition with each other, as were their mothers. When they were in preschool, it was who brought home the best finger painting. When they were nine, it was who could assemble the Lego castle the fastest. In high school, it was who could get a date to the prom first, and upon graduating, it was who could get into the better college. They both ended up going to U-Dub. After opening their own bars, the competition was whose bar was the most successful, which has been going on ever since. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nJoe was at the bar the night Derek and Meredith met. He served them their drinks and watched as they talked. ''(\"[[Time Has Come Today]]\")''\n\n\nJoe collapsed one day on the floor of his bar. He walked across the street to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a basal artery aneurysm. To clip the aneurysm, Derek and Burke planned a stand-still surgery. Joe didn't want the surgery because he was concerned about the cost. He feared he would not be able to keep his bar which was his life. Joe had had his bar for fourteen years. Luckily, [[George O'Malley]] was able to convince the Chief to have Joe's surgery funded by donating his body to science and qualifying him for a research grant since he would be briefly \"dead\", allowing him to keep the bar. ''(\"[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\")''\n\n\nAfter confessing her love to Derek and asking him to choose her, Meredith went to the bar and asked Joe if he believed Derek would pick her. He was sure Derek would pick her. ''(\"[[Bring the Pain]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith waited for Derek and got progressively more drunk, the news of a train crash caused all the doctors to get paged. Joe turned on the news so they could see what had happened. He tried to convince Meredith to stay for a cup of coffee before going to the hospital. Shortly after she left, Derek walked in and Joe broke the news that Meredith had left. ''(\"[[Into You Like a Train]]\")''\n\n\nJoe watched as Cristina and Izzie counted up the money they'd made selling tickets to Shane's surgery. ''(\"[[Something to Talk About]]\")''\n\n\nJoe attending Thanksgiving dinner at [[Meredith's House]]. He brought along his boyfriend, [[Walter]], whom the doctors had not previously met. He also brought a pie to share. He and Walter stayed despite most of the guests not showing up on time, but eventually had to leave before they came because he had to open the bar. ''(\"[[Thanks for the Memories]]\")''\n\n\nAfter a long day of surgery, Derek came to the bar, where Joe poured him a drink without even asking what he wanted. ''(\"[[Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the residents were at the bar comparing stories to see who was having the worst day, Joe observed and prompted Izzie when it was her turn. He then had to break up a fight that occurred when [[Nurse Kate]] poured a drink on [[Cristina Yang]]. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nAfter visiting her father, Meredith ended up at Joe's to get a drink. Mark came in and sat down next to her. ''(\"[[Yesterday]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith was trying to be celibate, she came to Joe's, but didn't drink. Instead, she was knitting a sweater. Joe said that she was scaring the customers by knitting. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the interns were at the bar, Izzie and Alex exchanged insults. When Izzie called Alex a gynecologist disparagingly, Joe laughed. ''(\"[[ Seconds]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie baked muffins to cope with Denny's death, she brought two baskets of them to the bar for Joe. Addison ate one basket of muffins while she got drunk and at the end of the day, Joe called Addison a cab per her instructions. ''(\"[[I Am a Tree]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie came into the bar to meet with [[Dennison Duquette, Sr.|Denny's father]], Joe pointed him out to her. ''(\"[[What I Am]]\")''\n\n\nJoe and Walter went on a camping trip with several of the male doctors. During the camping trip, he discussed his relationship with Walter with Richard Webber and they bonded over some similarities. Later, when Walter was injured, Joe held his hand while he got stitches. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\n\nAfter George's dad died, Alex went to the bar. Joe asked him about Harold and Alex informed him that Harold had died. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nwhen Meredith drowned in [[Elliott Bay]], Cristina left the hospital and went to the dollar store and then to the bar, where she talked to Joe as she got drunk, thinking Meredith would die. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nJoe and Walter decided to have kids and put in an application to adopt. They met up with [[Rina]], who was deciding between them and another couple to adopt her baby. They took her to get prenatal care because she hadn't had any and an ultrasound revealed twins. Later, while Walter was taking her to the bus station, Rina started having severe chest pain, so he brought her back to the bar, where she collapsed and was taken back to the ER. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nIn the ER, [[Preston Burke]] took over her care and said she'd need surgery for an aortic dissection, which meant the babies would probably be born that day. They took her into the OR, where the babies were quickly delivered and Burke repaired her heart. After her surgery, she was stable and awake. Walter and Joe sat by her bedside as they held their newborn twins. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nAs part of Callie and Mark's pact not to sleep with any interns, they agreed to sit at the bar and stare at Joe, which freaked Joe out. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Archer Montgomery|Archer's]] surgery was successful, Addison, Sam, Naomi, Mark, and Derek came to the bar to celebrate. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\nWhen their celebrating continued into the next morning, Joe pointed that out to them. ''(\"[[Ex-Life]]\")''\n\n\nAfter the stress of the merger, Richard started drinking again and Joe served him. ''(\"[[New History]]\")''\n\nWhen Richard became drunk on New Year's Day, Joe called Meredith to come take care of him. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n\nJoe was present when a camera crew filmed a documentary about the doctors at the hospital. He gave interviews on his point of view of the doctors. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nAfter Cristina quit her residency, Owen told her to get a job, so she went to work at the bar. Joe quickly became frustrated with her as she was a terrible bartender. He ultimately fired her. ''(\"[[Slow Night, So Long]]\")''\n\n\nHe enjoys listening to other people's problems, keeping the peace, breaking up fights over games of pool and darts, babysitting drunk employees of Seattle Grace, controlling the flow of alcohol as well as the TV remote. He also enjoys movies, television, exercising (in small doses), and almost any outdoor activity.\n\nJoe is very friendly to his customers, one of the many reasons many of the hospital staff go there.\n\n\n\n[[Walter]]\nOn a camping trip, Joe revealed during a discussion with the Chief that although he and [[Walter]] had been \"on-and-off\" for about ten years, they were now committed and considering the possibility of children, but Walter said he didn't want to raise kids alone because Joe was always working at the bar. However, Joe said that he loved Walter so much that if he needed to make a change, he would. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\nThey were one of two couples being considered as adoptive parents for a young mother's twins.\n\nJoe and [[Walter]] also attended the Thanksgiving [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] hosted at [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] house, and went on a camping trip with Drs. [[Derek Shepherd|Shepherd]], [[Preston Burke|Burke]], [[Richard Webber|Webber]], [[Alex Karev|Karev]] and [[George O'Malley|O'Malley]].\n\nMax\nHe dated a guy named Max for about four weeks. Prior to that, they were friends. Things ended when Joe made the mistake of talking about a hot lifeguard in front of Max. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nHe has a nephew and a niece named Samantha. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\nHe is close with his mother, who lives just down the street from him. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n\nJoe gets along well with most of the doctors from the hospital across the street from his bar.\n\n[[Debbie]]\nHe and Debbie are best friends. During the first annual Emerald City Bar Darts Tournament, Joe's partner flaked on him, and Debbie volunteered to be his partner. Her dart skills brought her and Joe up to semifinals, where they lost. Joe congratulated Debbie on her dart skills and she thanked him for taking her mind off work. While munching on peanuts, they began to gossip about people they both know. Joe likes to say that they bonded over darts, but Debbie says that they share a common love for gossip. They have been best friends ever since.\ua''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\nEric\nHe has a friend named Eric who sustained a head injury from the [[Dead Baby Bike Race]]. ''(\"[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]\")''\n\n[[Miranda Bailey]]\nWhen Bailey was an intern, she spent a lot of time in the bar talking to Joe. He told her she was worth something, not that he knew anything about it. He gave her confidence. She described him as the only one who really knew her at the time.\ua''(\"[[Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head]]\")'' ''(\"[[The Time Warp]]\")''\n\n\nBefore befriending the other interns of his class, Alex hung out at the bar a lot with Joe becoming his only friend.\n\n\nHe owns and runs [[Emerald City Bar]], which is across the street from [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He's owned the bar for over  years.\n\n\n*He has an official blog, [http://www.emeraldcitybar.com/]\n*He is  years old.<ref>[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]</ref>\n*He minored in German in college.<ref>[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]</ref>\n*His favorite drink is the Irish Car Bomb.

''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nMegan told Steve that Henry, presumably another intern, was observing in [[Tricia Hale|Tricia Hale's]] surgery when Mark Sloan announced to the whole OR that [[Izzie Stevens]] and [[George O'Malley]] had broken up. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nLucy and Meredith's other interns worked on Meredith and Derek's tumor trial. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\nThey later had to organize and collate trial patients. Meredith threatened them with scut if they missed a paper. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural to practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nLeo, Sadie, and Megan all had to work with Izzie in the clinic for a day. When they did procedures on patients, she also had them perform them on her. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nMegan found out that she was pregnant after sleeping with Steve while on a break with Pierce. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nMegan was affected by George's death. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program.\n\nCristina had Pierce, Megan, and Leo spy on the Chief for her and report back what they saw. Megan was ultimately fired as part of the first round of layoffs. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nAfter she was fired, she filed a lawsuit against the hospital, claiming they fired her because she was pregnant. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nMegan agreed to participate in a documentary someone was making about the doctors at the hospital only because she expected to get paid for it. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to give her a fresh start, [[Derek Shepherd]] re-hired Megan when he was appointed Chief. ''(\"[[State of Love and Trust]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Pierce Halley]]\nPierce was dating Megan at some point, but they broke up when Megan found a nurse's phone number in his scrubs. During their break, Megan slept with [[Steve Mostow|Steve]] and Steve accidentally sent an email to people about their hookup, including Pierce. According to [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]], Pierce wanted to kill Steve. Pierce fought him leaving Steve with a bloody hand, almost broken and himself with a black eye. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n[[Steve Mostow]]\nLater, Megan and Steve were married by Steve's uncle, with Graciella as a witness. On New Year's Eve, Pierce demanded that Megan get a paternity test, claiming that he could be the father. She was conflicted over the test, fearing that if the baby was Pierce's, Steve would be devastated. But even when the results confirmed the father was Steve, he divorced her. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nOriginally one of [[Meredith Grey|Meredith Grey's]] [[Internship|interns]], Megan became a [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She wanted to become a [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgeon]].\n\nDuring the merger of Settle Grace and Mercy West, she was cut from the program. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")'' After being fired, by email, she decided to sue the hospital for wrongful termination, claiming they fired her due to her pregnancy. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Derek Shepherd]] became [[Chief of Surgery]], he hired Megan back, telling her that even if there would be other cutbacks, he wanted to give her another chance to prove her value as a doctor.\n\n\n*After Megan was hired back after the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]], she was never seen or mentioned again.\n*She took piano lessons.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n*She and Steve lived at  Wentworth Street when they were married.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n*She would like to see Disneyland in Paris.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n*She hates surprises.<ref>[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]</ref>\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nInternMegan.png|[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Let the Truth Sting]]\nInternsLucyandMegan.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Forever Young]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Piece of My Heart]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Freedom, Part ]]\nInternsLucyandMegan.png|[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]\nInterns.png|[[Here Comes the Flood]]\nInternsMeganandDani.png|[[Brave New World]]\nInternsLisaandMegan.png|[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Life During Wartime]]\nInternMegan.png|[[In the Midnight Hour]]\nInterns.png|[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\nInterns.png|[[Before and After]]\nInternMegan.png|[[An Honest Mistake]]\nInternMegan.png|[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\nInternMegan.png|[[Stand By Me]]\nInternsPierceRyanandMegan.png|[[Elevator Love Letter]]\nxMeganGraciella.png|[[Good Mourning]]\nxMeganMostow.png|[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\nxMeganMostow.png|[[State of Love and Trust]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Megan Nowland Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Megan Nowland]]\n[[de:Megan Nowland]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nowland, Megan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Webisode Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

He was entered into the donor list  seconds before Denny Duquette. When two donor hearts became available at Mercy West Medical Center, Erica Hahn went to retrieve Michael's and Preston Burke to retrieve Denny's. After Denny's donor died, Burke fought over Michael's donor's heart. After calling UNOS, they confirmed that Michael was higher on the list than Denny by a very small margin, but being entered into the list  seconds earlier gave him the edge. After Izzie found this out, she lied and said that Denny was getting worse, hoping to move his status up so he'd get the heart. When they asked her to confirm with tests, she cut Denny's LVAD wire to worsen his condition so she could get tests results that said he was in worse condition. The heart ultimately went to Denny, causing Michael to go back on the transplant list.

I deserve it and if any one of them has the misguided impression that there is any choice at all in this matter, I will set that person on the righteous path before he or she can reveal him or herself as a moron.|'''Miranda Bailey'''}}\n\n'''Miranda Bailey''' is a [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] and the former [[Chief of Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She is married to [[Ben Warren]] and has one son, [[William George Bailey Jones|Tuck]], with her ex-husband, [[Tucker Jones]]. During her internship at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], she was very quiet and had no confidence, until she was mentored by [[Richard Webber]]. While in her residency, she was known as ''The Nazi'' to her interns, due to her tough and no-nonsense personality. However, she later dropped the nickname after operating on a real Nazi.\n\n\n\nAlthough Bailey has rarely spoken about her childhood, she has said that growing up she liked ''Star Wars'', took dance classes, played the oboe\uain the school band, and believed in Santa until the age of eleven.\n\nShe did not attend homecoming because the boy she liked never asked her out.\n\nHer mother (Elena) was very protective of her because she had lost another daughter before Miranda Bailey.\n\n\nAt the beginning of her internship, she met [[Debbie]], a nurse at Seattle Grace, who taught her how to be respectful to patients, as well as superiors and her fellow interns. She also told Bailey to not \"piss off the nurses\", and warned her of the consequences if she did so.\n\nWhile working on a patient about to have open-heart surgery, she became increasingly cranky and ordered Debbie to get her coffee. Debbie got her coffee, but she got her revenge and had Bailey do scut for an entire month.<ref>[[Overheard at the Emerald City Bar]]</ref>\n\nHer first solo surgery was an appendectomy during her intern year on Alicia Tatum, but it turned out Alicia's appendix was perfectly healthy. Alicia was a mystery; every test they did on her came out negative. She was sent home but came back, and Miranda diagnosed her with porphyria. She scolded Dr. Baylow for being careless, and Richard sent\uaher to his office. He made it look like he was angry with her, but he actually told her she was going to make \"a hell of a surgeon\".\n\n\nHer reputation as \"The Nazi\" preceded her as her interns were seen nervously discussing her after learning about their assignments on their first day of work.<ref>[[A Hard Day's Night]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey kept her pregnancy news private from others, as she didn't want to get her personal life caught up in her professional life. She later admitted the pregnancy to Chief Webber, after he asked her about whether or not she was accepting a fellowship at Seattle Grace.\n\n\nThe position of Chief Resident was initially given to Dr. Torres. The Chief justified his decision by saying he didn't want Bailey to get caught up in the paperwork, and that she was too good a surgeon for that. Bailey was not entirely happy with his decision. After seeing Callie struggling due to the situation with George, Bailey elected to be her number two. She called the shots for the day, helping the residents with their patients and the doctors with their problems. Chief Webber realized that she was the one doing the amazing work, and as such gave her the position of Chief Resident.\n\n\nAt first, Bailey disliked Peds, because she couldn't see kids suffer, as it reminded her of her son, but after working with Arizona on a case, Arizona said she was perfect for the job. It took some time for Bailey to notice, but Peds was in her interest. When Bailey considered a pediatric surgery fellowship, her then-husband Tucker gave her an ultimatum: him or the job. She decided to leave him but also didn't accept the fellowship because she was becoming a single mom.\n\n\nDuring the point in time when Izzie Stevens, her former intern, and resident, was diagnosed with stage  melanoma that had spread to her liver, skin, and brain, Dr. Bailey was with her all the way, as her doctor and her friend. When all of her friends, and her new fianc\ue, Alex Karev, were too afraid to go visit her, Dr. Bailey was supportive, and a very motherly figure to Izzie. At one point, before her very risky surgery, Izzie gave Bailey a green knitted scarf which she had made during her cancer treatment. She gave it to Bailey because Bailey had supported her throughout her cancer treatment.\n\nMeredith discovered that their John Doe patient was actually George O'Malley. He was later pronounced brain dead in surgery. Everyone was devastated, especially Bailey, who said that she needed to stop caring so much because it was interfering with her life.\n\n\nBen and Bailey started going out after Miranda's divorce. Miranda had some inhibitions, as she had only ever had sex with her ex-husband, she had a child, she was divorced, but Ben didn't care. Ben was as headstrong as Bailey and they balanced each other out, but she was busy putting herself back together with \"tape and glue\" after the shooting, so they broke up, following the revelation that Ben was out golfing the day the shooting happened so he wouldn't have memories of that day.\n\n\nBailey had a fling with a headstrong male nurse by the name of [[Eli Lloyd|Eli]]. Ben told her that he thought she wanted him to wait for her after she broke up with him and that she was unclear. She ended things with Eli and resumed her relationship with Ben.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter agreeing to move in together, Ben invited Bailey to lunch, but she got paged on a once in a lifetime case. They fought while she was operating and she found out he wanted her to do the crossword puzzle. She dropped everything to show him how childish it was and said the crossword was too easy. She got to a -letter answer with the clue: My question to you. He revealed that he made it and it took months to do. He was asking her to marry him. Later, she came to him in nothing but a trench coat and thong and proposed to him, but they didn't immediately get engaged because Ben told her he was offered a surgical internship at UCLA.\n\n\nWhen she heard that there was a plane crash, she brought Zola to Meredith. When they were on the plane, which was transporting her, Richard, and the sedated plane crash victims to Seattle, she said that she wished they sedated her too.<ref>[[Remember the Time]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey was very nervous about this wedding, as she'd been married and divorced before. Her wedding got delayed because of Adele Webber, who had undergone emergency surgery, which was performed by Bailey. Ben didn't mind waiting for her. Much later than expected, Miranda and Ben got married.\n\n\nThree of Bailey's patients returned with post-operative infections. It was initially believed to be the fault of [[Leah Murphy]], who was ill but assisted on Bailey's surgeries.\n\nHowever, following the arrival of the third patient, whose surgery Dr. Murphy had not assisted on, it was apparent that the problem was more serious and the CDC was alerted.\n\nFollowing the investigation, it was deduced that Dr. Bailey was contaminated with MRSA, an aggressive infection which resulted in the deaths of all three patients.\n\nThe infections were transmitted due to the replacement of surgical gloves instituted via Pegasus policy, which possessed microtears.\n\nFollowing the investigation, Dr. Bailey became reclusive and refused to operate, testing herself repeatedly for MRSA. It was only when Meredith was critical post-natally did she step in and save her.\n\n\nFollowing her experience with MRSA, Bailey was more cautious in surgery. This came to a head when her husband, [[Ben Warren|Ben]] quit his surgical residency to return to [[Seattle]] to be with his family.\n\nAfter Bailey was informed of this, she began to show signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) which caught her husband's attention.\n\nWhile casually speaking to Derek he mentioned that her condition could be affecting patient care. Derek, being a member of the board, was required to investigate and report these claims, which he did with the help of Owen.\n\nThey came to the conclusion that she was unfit to continue performing surgery and required psychiatric help. [[Dr. Alma]], an occupational therapist, was assigned to shadow her and clear her when she deemed Dr. Bailey ready.\n\nAfter the first two days, Dr. Alma tested Bailey's control over her condition and recommended that she take the medication she had been prescribed.\n\nAfter a conversation with [[Richard Webber]], Bailey finally agreed. The medication was effective and she was cleared to return to surgery.\n\n\nWhen Owen decided to step down as Chief of Surgery, Richard told Bailey she'd become his successor. Catherine refused to just appoint Bailey right away and demanded that she be tested against an outside candidate of Catherine's choosing. Upon hearing that, Bailey stated she felt sorry for the other candidate because she'd wipe the floor with them.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\nHer confidence took a hit when the candidate turned out to be\ua[[Tracy McConnell]], who immediately proved to be very capable and popular with the other doctors. Ben convinced her not to back down. Bailey gave her speech in her OR and told the board members that she deserved the job because she'd do anything to make the hospital the best it could be, while it'd only be a temporary project for Tracy, who jumps from challenge to challenge. The board members voted and Bailey was appointed Chief of Surgery.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], x</ref>\n\n\nBailey initiated the Code Orange when she heard that Alison was raped by Keith, and they had not been having consensual sex. When there was an explosion, and Meredith, Arizona, and Eliza were blocked from entering the hospital, Bailey cleared them, saying that fire trumped rapist on the loose. She later helped with the evacuation and was surprised to see Nathan, who was in the OR, just exiting the hospital when they evacuated the OR ages ago. After Eliza forgot to alert the police about Stephanie going missing, Bailey fired Eliza, saying that the hospital doesn't produce surgical robots. They produce human beings who know when not to follow the rules too strictly, which she came to realize Eliza couldn't do.<ref>[[Ring of Fire]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Ben told her that he was going to be a firefighter, Bailey began to ignore him and their relationship was strained.\n\nOn the day of her son's school presentation, Bailey went to Seattle Presbyterian Hospital and told the [[Julia Udell|nurse]] that she was having a heart attack. She was admitted and [[Intern Stuart|Stuart]], an intern, said that she wasn't showing any signs of a heart attack and that the test results looked fine as well. Later, [[Larry Maxwell|Dr. Larry Maxwell]] arrived and asked if she was having any stress, but Bailey told him that it wasn't because she was a woman who can't handle her feelings. She requested for a cardiac stress test and a second opinion, but Maxwell ignored her and asked her some other questions instead.\n\nAfter Bailey called Maggie to come over to Seattle Pres, [[Rich Gregory|Dr. Gregory]], a psychiatrist, believed that her condition was psychological rather than\uaphysical, but Bailey refused to play into that theory. Maggie and Richard arrived and found Bailey doing CPR on a [[Morgan|coding patient]]. As soon as she was done, she collapsed and they had to take her to surgery. Bailey was doing well for a while, but her pressure dropped and Maggie inserted an intra-aortic balloon pump. Maggie\uaasked Maxwell if he did a cardiac stress test and began to argue with him over Bailey's care because if he did the stress test, he would have seen the condition before it became emergent. Maggie then planned to perform a keyhole procedure. Before Bailey was put under, she asked for Ben and said that she needed her husband.\n\nAfter surgery, Bailey woke up. Ben arrived at the hospital and explained to Bailey that he quit his job at the fire station. Bailey told Ben to call his boss back and said that working as a firefighter was terrifying, but life was terrifying and was too precious to waste doing anything less than what makes him happy.\n\nWith Richard and Ben at her side, Bailey called her mother\uaElena and told her she had a heart attack and that it was scary, but she was okay. Elena knew she was because she was her Mandy.<ref>[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]], x</ref>\n\n\nOn the morning of Jo and Alex's wedding, Bailey received a big check from the TrailBlazer. She and Ben were among the guests to follow a faulty GPS link, landing them at the wrong location and wrong wedding. When the bride's mother collapsed, Bailey and Ben took her to the hospital. Bailey got some scrubs and had Vik page whomever from cardio was on call. Everyone on call was all busy, but as a gift from God, [[Teddy Altman]] appeared with her luggage. She just arrived from Germany. Bailey had her scrub in so they could repair her abdominal aortic aneurysm. In surgery, Bailey talked about how her being at the wrong wedding saved this woman's life, only mere months after she nearly died herself. She changed her lifestyle to a more healthy one, but she did resume her life as if nothing had happened. Upon learning Teddy wasn't there for the wedding, Teddy revealed she had come there looking for a job, but Bailey didn't respond.\n\nAfter the successful surgery, Teddy apologized for putting her on the spot, but Bailey said it was just one more sign that it was time for a sabbatical from the Chief job. She wanted to have time to innovate and fall in love with the OR again and spend more time with her loved ones. She had tried to ignore the voice of the patriarchy in her head telling her she couldn't rest because she was a woman, but she decided to listen to her own voice and take the sabbatical after all. She then offered Teddy the position of interim Chief. Teddy was interested, but their talk was cut short when Ben came to say it was time for a wedding. They organized a wedding in the chapel for the couple whose wedding was cut short by the collapse of the bride's mother and set up a video chat so the mother could watch the ceremony from the ICU.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey had adjusted her lifestyle to a healthy one.]]\nThe next day, Bailey found Teddy waiting for her in her office. Teddy had decided she wouldn't be staying in Seattle after all and therefore wouldn't accept the job. Word got out and throughout the day, several attendings put their name in the mix for the job.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nAs she showed him her innovative hyperbaric medicine lab, new Head of Ortho [[Atticus Lincoln]] helped her realize that she didn't want someone too good to replace her so that she would be missed and welcomed back with open arms. Bailey then spent the day in the hyperbaric chamber to get away from people pitching themselves for the job. Meredith found her and brought up Jo's plan to create a surgical innovation fellowship for her. Since she spent quite a lot of money on the hyperbaric chamber, the hospital couldn't afford both to hire Alex back and fund the fellowship. Bailey later witnessed Jackson put the hyperbaric chamber to good use to debride [[Nisha|Nisha's]] wound in there for a better outcome. However, Nisha passed away due to an infection.\n\nRichard later visited Bailey in her office and she explained to him that she wasn't giving him the job because she didn't want to add to his plate with his struggles after Ollie's death. After he left, Jo and Alex came back and Jo pitched why she was the future of medicine. Bailey was impressed and saw a solution to all her problems. She hired Alex back and appointed him interim Chief and decided to fund Jo's fellowship with her own money from the TrailBlazer. That also meant she would be running the fellowship instead of Meredith, which was the perfect opportunity to find both joy and tranquility.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey ignores her fellow to fix Alex's messes on his first day.]]\nNo longer being Chief took some adjusting, like losing her personal parking spot. She checked in with Alex and both tried to hide their nerves, but Alex assured her he had this and told her to go de-stress. She assured him that she trusted him with the job. Alex had messed up the OR schedule, so Bailey fixed that and invited Jo to scrub in with her so they could discuss her fellowship. However, Bailey kept hearing that the nurses had been understaffed during first shift, so she ran out to fix that. She ignored the research Jo sent her and went to the Chief's office to verify some of Alex's work. She found he had spent the entire quarter's budget on his first day. Bailey stayed and helped him to rectify his mistake, but she was starting to think that having him replace her was a mistake.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Bailey and Maggie took care of [[Natalie Forrester]] and her family, who had been brought to the hospital by Andy, Ben, and Dean. She found out that Ben had a burn, which he tried to hide from her. She was not amused. She later cleared Andy and Dean to take off, which was required per a new policy and chastized them for letting Ben damage his surgical hands. Bailey later watched [[Evan Forrester]] say goodbye to his wife while his son Max was still in the dark. Despite Evan's misguided attempts to spare Max from the pain, Max had found out that his mother was dying and he ran off into the city.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nPlagued by worries over Ben, Bailey couldn't sleep, so she got to work early and started working on Jo's idea for cancer killer cells. She wrote whiteboards full of possible approaches, which they had to narrow down to fit them all in one year. Alex came to fetch her and Jo for a surgical consult on [[Nina Sullivan]], who had a yet-undiagnosed cause of abdominal pain and came to the hospital for Meredith, who was out for the day. Bailey and Jo convinced her they were as good as Meredith and after a thorough work-up and a process of elimination, they figured out the diagnosis and resolved the problem surgically. Later, Jo found Bailey in their lab. Bailey told her that she had applied the process of elimination to her own life, too, to remove stressors from her life, but she was still stressed. She then suggested Ben's new job was the source of her stress.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nSoon after, she found a paper detailing Ben's death benefit at home. At work, she flourished as a mentor to Jo. They revived a liver from a deceased donor using normothermic perfusion. Alex ordered them to shut it down since it wasn't UNOS-approved and a failure could risk their standing with the organization, but they performed the procedure behind his back because case reports from Europe had Bailey convinced it would work. They did not face any consequences because the procedure was successful. Throughout the day, she had sent Ben worried texts since she - again - had not heard from him all day, but all of them were left unanswered. Privately, she measured her blood pressure, which was way too high. She then texted Ben that they needed to talk on his next day off.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Bailey tells Ben she wants a marriage sabbatical in hopes that it would lower her stress levels.]]\nShe took a day off so they could spend his day off together. While she wanted to talk, he was happy that they could spend the day together and they had sex. Afterward, they had breakfast on the couch and she talked about how seeing Jo and Alex balance their work-life with his being Chief reminded her of her and Ben. He knew it had been hard on her since his job change and said it was time for them to re-connect. He was wondering what they could do to do that, but she couldn't ignore what she had to say any longer. She told him that stepping down as Chief hadn't helped to lower her stress and blood pressure. She told him that worrying about him and if he would come home at night was not helping. She needed a break from that, too. She explained that she needed time to get well and work on herself. She promised she wasn't trying to see other people or keep him from Tuck, but she hoped that she would stop worrying about whether he would come home or not if she knew that he wasn't coming home. While he thought that that was just the first step to a divorce, she desperately told him that she needed to try because she couldn't breathe every time she thought about him getting hurt. She was afraid that being married to him was killing her. He packed a suitcase and she assured him that it wasn't final. He left after kissing her goodbye.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], x (S)</ref>\n\nDespite their sabbatical, Ben returned to the house to board up the windows in preparation for the windstorm. With Alex unable to make it to the hospital, Bailey briefly resumed her role as Chief. She benched Richard upon hearing that he had been arrested after demolishing a bar. She made a speech in the ER to announce that they were a brick house that the storm couldn't blow down and that they would stay open for traumas. The crowd applauded and she was glad to see she still got it. Richard later vented his concerns to her that Catherine was having an affair with Tom Koracick. Bailey scoffed at the idea and then informed him of her own marriage sabbatical. He said the worrying wouldn't stop because she asked Ben to stay away. He told her that fixing the inside from the outside wouldn't work and that she needed to get real help. Afterward, Bailey joined Taryn on an elevator to take [[Phoebe Moss]] up to the OR to procure her organs for [[Cece Colvin]]. However, a power outage trapped the elevator between floors.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref>\n\nBailey and Taryn had to keep each other calm and stop themselves from catastrophizing while ventilating Phoebe manually. She started pulling her fingers again. Eventually, they were rescued by [[Jed Lundberg]] and Jackson. They had to climb out and took Phoebe to the OR. During the procedure, Alex came to inform them that Jed's legs had been crushed when the elevator started working again mid-climb. Bailey ordered Alex to take over for her so she could go help him out and lead the hospital. Alex later found her in his office and told her she could have her job back if she was going to treat him the way she did. She told Alex that she was in crisis and didn't trust herself to finish the procurement. She then received a reassuring text from Ben to tell her he was safe and she broke down crying. She then begged Alex not to quit as she needed more time to straighten things out. He agreed to help her with whatever she needed.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nRichard telling her she needed to seek help led her to go back to her therapist. Faithfully doing her exercises, she made progress and began noticing again when she was pulling her fingers. At work, Teddy asked her for a job again, but Bailey directed her to Alex. Bailey and Maggie later watched Catherine's last surgery before her own spinal surgery from the gallery. Maggie practiced talking about her feelings with her and said that Catherine, Jackson, and Richard were delaying the inevitable by not talking about the tumor. Bailey told her the storm would come when it did, which was part of her exercise to stop trying to control things she couldn't control. The storm came after surgery. Bailey wanted to enter a lounge, but Maggie stopped her from going in because Catherine, Richard, and Jackson were fighting in there.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref> Everyone came to terms with it and they made up for the surgery. Bailey sat down with Richard in the gallery and stayed with him during Catherine's surgery. When the surgeons had to flip Catherine on the table, Richard couldn't bear to look at the risky move, so Bailey informed when it was over.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], x</ref>\n\nBailey and Ben remained separated through the holidays. Ben dropped off presents for Tuck on Christmas Eve. She had also written Ben's name on the presents she had got Tuck herself, but she promised to also give him Ben's gifts. He told her he was on call on Christmas, so they might see each other in the pit. On NYE, Bailey contemplated calling Ben but decided against it as it might seem like a booty call. A few weeks later, they ran into each other in the ER and she followed him outside. She told him her heart was ready for him to come back. She felt lonely without him when Tuck was at his father's and the fence needed some repair work. He told her she had broken his heart, so he wouldn't come home for the fence. She then told him that she was focusing so much on her physical health since the heart attack that she had neglected her mental health. Her meds needed to be adjusted, which is why she had been off. She told him she was being treated, but he didn't respond and left for an emergency. A few days later, on Valentine's Day, she came home and found Ben working in the front yard. He told her that she had told him to follow his bliss, but then she turned on him and left him over it. If he were to come back, he needed to know that that would never happen again. He said he should have realized something was wrong with her and brought up that he never followed through on building her the treehouse, which she asked for as a place to de-stress. She then noticed he was building her that treehouse and promised she would never call time-out on them again. They went inside and celebrated Valentine's Day in the bedroom.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nWith her home life back on track, Bailey grew increasingly impatient to get her job back, but there were still two months to go. She noticed that Alex had started a weekly free breakfast for the interns to boost morale. Much to her dismay, she discovered that a display with pictures from all past and present Chiefs had been installed in the cafeteria, with Alex's picture last. The pictures continued to bother her. She told Richard that Alex was praised in an article for the hospital's innovation while that was actually all her doing. Richard told her that's how it goes sometimes and shared a story of how she performed emergency surgery on a long-time patient of his, who now sent her a basket of pears every year. However, as soon as he was gone, she switched her picture with Alex's. At the end of the day, she tried to get Alex to give her her job back, but he had become good at it and insisted on finishing out the contract. Begrudgingly, she told him she was proud of him for standing up for himself like she had taught him.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Meredith was breaking the hospital's longest surgery record, Bailey helped out in the ER with the mass overdose victims. When Betty was discovered amongst the teenagers, she was diagnosed with an aortic dissection. Teddy decided to operate and Bailey forbade Owen from tagging himself in. At the end of the day, Ben and Bailey left together. Bailey said the world is a scary place, no matter how well you raise your kids. Ben told her to focus on the beauty of the world with him for a moment.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]],x</ref>\n\nOn the night of Catherine's party, Catherine enticed Bailey to drive there in the back of a limo with her. Bailey had been warned Catherine might try to ditch her party, but she couldn't resist the party. Bailey appreciated the luxury and Catherine pointed out she had the money to buy nice things for herself outside of taking care of business, like fixing the garage door and paying off her car and property taxes. Bailey was reluctant to indulge because she didn't know how the TrailBlazer would be a success, but Catherine told her that money comes and goes and you need to let yourself enjoy it before it's gone. She convinced Bailey to buy the expensive C TurboMix, pointing out the joy it would bring her. Catherine then had the limo pull over. She didn't want to go because people would congratulate her like it was all over, but she was not cancer-free. She didn't want to celebrate living in constant dread. Bailey told her she needed to learn to spend joy like she had learned to spend money. She shared that she no longer trusted her heart and might drop dead tomorrow. But they were alive and people loved them, which was cause enough to celebrate. As soon as they arrived, the guests gathered for a speech, but that was interrupted by Owen and Tom's fight and a supposed fire in the kitchen. Everyone was evacuated. Ben responded to the call and after the penthouse was cleared, he offered Bailey a ride home on the aid car.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nWith  days left on the contract, Alex had Bailey cover the ER since both Owen and Teddy were out on personal days. She told him she was looking forward to no longer having to take orders from him.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey disapproves of the research approved by Alex.]]\nWith her resuming the position coming closer, Bailey started to look into the DeLuca research on external gestational sacks that Alex had approved. She thought it was an ethical slippery slope and she hated that she would have to handle in a few weeks. She advised Alex to look into Vincenzo DeLuca's mental health issues. Later, she ran into [[Helen Karev]] in the cafeteria and during their chat, Helen revealed she had extended her stay because she was scared of flying back and didn't dare to ask Alex for help. Bailey later informed him of this. Alex thought she was on a crusade against people with mental illness, but she pointed out she was someone with mental illness herself, so she knew how hard it could be to ask for help. She needed help herself not too long ago, which is why she asked him to stay on as Chief. Later, Alex asked Bailey to take over as Chief for  days so he could fly back to Iowa with his mother.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> Still able to relax shortly before taking back over, Bailey spent the day playing Tetris in one of Maggie's mood rooms. She took a short break to quiz a math whiz on math problems.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nOn Bailey's last sabbatical day, she and Ben found out that Tuck was \"just talking\" to a girl named Kelly. As they dropped him off, they saw him put his arm around her. Ben and Bailey took a break after he dropped a patient off at the hospital and she said they needed to talk to Tuck about respect, consent, and condoms so that he could properly enjoy his butterflies and first love. Ben offered to take that off her plate as his father gave him the talk and it worked. Bailey later stood among the wall of women to support [[Abby Redding]].<ref>[[Silent All These Years]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey guides STEM students around the hospital.]]\nOn her first day back, she paged Alex because she couldn't find the compliance reports for the medical board, which were due tomorrow. He had no clue what she was talking about and left. Levi then also dumped a few STEM students on here, who were to learn about leadership, something she had approved months ago. As she guided them around the hospital, they ran into all kinds of awkward situations and people yelling and making mistakes. She apologized to the students and proposed they reschedule for a less hectic day, but they told her they had learned a lot from the way she handled the situations. She then also discovered that Alex had been handing off paperwork to the interns. She later showed Richard the results of that. They both thought it was an amazing idea, but they agreed Alex could never know they did.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Tucker found out that Tuck was also calling Ben \"Dad,\" he had some angry calls with Bailey. Meredith asked her for advice on how to tell her kids that she was dating Andrew, which Bailey already knew about from Richard. Bailey told her that kids already know on some level and advised her to just make sure they knew she still loved them and that she was not going anywhere. Bailey settled the \"Dad\" issue by telling Tuck to call Ben by his name again as it hurt his father's feelings. Later, she comforted [[Warren Sterman]], a long-time patient of hers, as he grieved the death of his grandson, caused by a mistake by [[Nico Kim]].<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nBailey identified [[Lucas Ripley]] when Levi arrived with him at the hospital. Later, she was approached by both Ben and Teddy with concerns about Jo's wellbeing. They went to look for her and found her sobbing in [[Lori Carter|Lori Carter's]] arms. While Ben comforted her outside, Alex told Bailey that Jo had come back from Pittsburgh a changed person and that he didn't know what to do with her.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey and Catherine have a meeting about Meredith's insurance fraud.]]\nWhen the Olympia United Medical Group discovered the insurance fraud committed by Meredith, their representatives held an emergency meeting with Bailey and Catherine. They went over the case together all day and paged Andrew to ask for details on the case.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref> Andrew took the fall for Meredith, after which he was arrested. Bailey then found Jo lurking outside the room. She asked her if she could work today because many attendings were out and her star resident was just arrested. Jo said she could. Bailey and Catherine then settled the [[Gabriella Rivera]] case by telling [[Luis Rivera]] that the Foundation would pay for everything. After the meeting, she informed Richard of what Andrew had done, after which he ran off instead of joining her to the ER. As Bailey and Jo waited for an ambulance together, Jo told her they needed to talk later. Bailey and Richard operated together and she shared her suspicions that Andrew was just covering for Meredith and that he hadn't pulled it off by himself as he was too smart not to realize he was risking every employee's insurance and the Rivera family's asylum.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Meredith informs Bailey and Catherine on what she did.]]\nAs soon as she got herself out of the hyperbaric chamber, Meredith went to Catherine and Bailey and told them the truth. Alex and Richard came in to back her. They failed to report it but they couldn't bring themselves to put Luis through any more misery after everything he had been through. Bailey then fired all three of them. At the end of the day, Bailey watched as Jo checked herself into the in-patient psychiatry ward. As they walked off, Alex asked her if he was still fired, to which she replied it hurt her more than it did him.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nWith her three top attendings fired and DeLuca in jail, Bailey had to get Owen for an incoming trauma despite his daughter just having been born. A week later, she witnessed as Catherine took Tom into a private meeting. Another week passed by and Bailey found out that Catherine had hired Tom as her Foundation's Chief Medical Officer, meaning he would oversee all of the Catherine Fox Medical Centers' Chiefs, including Bailey. Bailey thought Catherine would stand by her. Catherine pointed out that doing so had created a big rift between her and Richard. She found she had less energy than before the cancer, so all small problems would be taken to Tom now instead of to her. Bailey was angered. Andrew showed up with a cocky attitude, knowing she needed help, which didn't help to calm her down. She spent a full week being angry, which exhausted her. She ran into Teddy in a lounge, who confessed she hated maternity leave and vented her fear that she was a bad mother. Bailey told her she had hated maternity leave, too, and that she was an excellent mother.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nTom's promotion left her without joy at work so she indulged in doughnuts instead of her usual green smoothies. Ben gave her a pep talk to go find herself joy. She had noticed the residents had been sulking around since she fired the three attendings, so she reminded them that she shaped Alex and Meredith into the surgeons they are today and offered to shape them, too. She gathered the residents for the case of [[Wade Foltz]], who needed an axillary-bifemoral bypass, and organized a skills lab for the toughest part of the procedure, promising that whoever finished first with good results would get to do that part in the actual surgery. Andrew beat out Taryn by mere seconds but Bailey chose Taryn instead. She also offered Jo full control over her fellowship to prevent her from quitting and accepting the same offer from Alex at Pac-North. Bailey hushed Andrew when he objected in the OR and later made him step in when there was bleeding from the suture line. Afterward, Bailey spotted Meredith in the waiting room with [[Robin (Season )|Robin]] as they went to check on Wade. Later, Andrew confronted her about sidelining him, suspecting she did so because of his relationship with Meredith. She clarified she wanted to give Taryn a taste of the adrenaline and fear that makes you a surgeon and warned him that he was making this personal. She suggested he think about his career and let go of certain loyalties. At the end of the day, Jo came to tell her she had considered her offer but wanted to be appointed attending general surgeon instead, using Alex's counteroffer in her negotiation. Bailey approved and hired her. At home, she told Ben about having found joy that day and how Tom was shocked in the nads by Owen, which made her laugh.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Shirley Gregory]] came in for her ALPPS procedure, Bailey showed confidence in Jo by letting her perform the procedure under her supervision despite Jo only ever having observed it. However, Shirley only wanted to be operated on by Meredith, so Bailey had to agree to let Meredith follow the procedure through video chat to get Shirley to consent. Bailey had to assist to repair a bleeding but Jo pulled it off successfully. Bailey hung up on Meredith as soon as Jo was done. Afterward, she found a disappointed Dahlia crying in a hallway and found out that Dahlia resented her for firing Meredith, who was the sole reason she, like many others, had worked so hard to get herself matched to Grey Sloan. Understanding Dahlia wasn't open to learning from anyone else, Bailey fired her so she at least had something in common with her hero.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a patient refused to be treated at Grey Sloan and was taken to Pac-North, Bailey learned that Meredith had published an article that trashed Grey Sloan. Bailey considered this a public attack and discovered it had sent the residents into mayhem, including the Chief Resident quitting on her. She appointed Andrew as Chief Resident to clean up the mess his girlfriend had made as he had failed to warn them about it before it came out. Bailey felt very hot and Jo suggested that her heart was in distress because of the stress caused by the article. Worried she might be right, Bailey fetched Maggie for a cardiac work-up, which revealed her heart was fine. Maggie suggested it was hormonal and drew blood to run a full panel. Knowing her mother went through early menopause, Bailey got emotional and asked Ben to sit with her and allow her to feel her feelings. Later, Meredith came by her office and told her that she had not meant for the article to come out like this. She said she had just pitched some ideas and the website published it this way, while she had never directed any comments towards the hospital itself, but rather at the medical system as a whole. Bailey shut down Meredith's suggestion to write a retraction since they never get read. Meredith stressed she would never attack her beloved hospital that taught her everything. Bailey recalled the many hours she had sacrificed from her family to be a mentor and friend to Meredith and said Meredith could apologize all she wanted but that the damage had been done. She asked Meredith to leave. Maggie later came by with her blood results. Bailey was indeed perimenopausal but also pregnant, which came as a shock.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nBailey tried to tell Ben about the pregnancy when he came home from an exhausting shift but he fell asleep as soon as he lay down on the bed. At work, Bailey took the case of [[Carly Davis]], who had a carbon monoxide poisoning from a suspected suicide attempt. Jo recognized Carly from her residential treatment and joined her and Bailey in the hyperbaric chamber. Bailey learned Carly was in fact one of her therapists, which resulted in Jo panicking and having shaky hands, which was ironic as Carly was the one who taught her tricks to keep her nervous system calm. Jo applied the techniques, including reciting a list of things you know by heart, but it didn't work. She feared she would never completely get better if even the person who helped her out of her depression could still attempt suicide. As she started to spiral, Bailey blurted out she was pregnant, which helped to calm Jo down. As Carly slowly improved, Jo asked her about the pregnancy. Bailey informed her Ben didn't know yet. She further said the pregnancy wasn't planned and that it terrified her but could also make her happy. Since Bailey started to panic, Jo had her recite Tuck's bedtime routine as a baby, which surprisingly helped. After solving Carly's case, Bailey offered to take the case off Jo's hands but Jo wanted to see it through. Bailey told her she watched Jo teeter on the edge, bring herself and Bailey back from that, and saved Carly's life in the process, which all told her Jo would be okay. After learning that the carbon monoxide poisoning had been an accident, Jo established a boundary and handed the case back to Bailey. Later, Bailey informed Ben she was in an emergency. He rushed to the hospital and found her. She eased his panic and told him about the pregnancy. While shocked at first, he was delighted and picked her up to twirl her around. In his excitement, he told some nearby staff.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nAround Halloween, Bailey's hormones started to get the better of her. She didn't want to cry at work, especially in front of Tom. She cried when Tuck sent her a picture of his costume. She also had cravings and started to think about how breastfeeding, which she had read was recommended now, would interfere with her career. She took her concerns to Amelia, who taught her some tricks to hold back tears. She worked on a case with Teddy and Tom. Teddy was worried that she was a bad mother because she hadn't provided amazing self-made costumes for her kids. Bailey assured her no one equated good costumes to good parenting and advised her to just focus on spending time with her kids. After the successful surgery, Bailey confronted Tom about his continuous complaining about Halloween. He apologized and shared with her the story of how Halloween was his and his son David's thing and how David died a few weeks before he could ever put on his Stormtrooper costume, which just hung on David's bedroom door for months as Tom couldn't bring himself to take it down. While Amelia's tricks had helped her throughout the day, she couldn't stop herself from sobbing. Tom awkwardly comforted her. Afterward, Bailey went to see the parade in the peds ward and learned that Teddy had dressed up her babies as zombies, which made Bailey suggest she buy costumes next year.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Bailey and Ben bask in joy as they look forward to meeting their baby.]]\nThe firefighters at [[SFD Station |Station ]] threw a surprise celebration for Ben and Bailey's baby, where Bailey learned that [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] was seeing [[Victoria Hughes|Vic]]. [[Travis Montgomery]] gave a speech to congratulate the pair though he ruined it by calling it a late-life pregnancy. While enjoying the food, they went around the table with each firefighter stating a wish for the baby. Afterward, Bailey and Ben lied down on top of the engine and talked about their baby possibly being a girl. She told Ben she felt safe there. She liked knowing there are heroes out there in the dangerous world and knowing them personally.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\nA few days later at Meredith's trial, Bailey was surprised to see that most of Meredith's former colleagues showed up to support her. While testifying, Bailey denied being close to Meredith and stated that Meredith lost the qualities that had made her promote Meredith to Head of General Surgery. She also confirmed a list of incidents involving Meredith to be true. She found out Richard had cheated the system to get Meredith a spot at Seattle Grace and she scoffed as Richard later took the blame again for Meredith's tampering with Derek's Alzheimer's trial during his testimony. During a break, she confronted him and he reiterated that it was his decision to make. She pointed out he had a habit of going around the system for Meredith no matter the consequences. Richard thought he was jealous but admitted he gave Meredith special treatment due to his history with Ellis, making him consider her family. Bailey said they could have come to her for help. Richard thought that would have led to Catherine firing her. She finally told him that their actions had cost her her hospital with Tom being in charge now, her best surgeons, and most importantly, her closest friend. She admitted she felt betrayed by someone she raised. He pointed out her testimony made him feel the same way as he thought she'd stand up for Meredith as he had.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Bailey finally testifies on Meredith's behalf.]]\nAfter the break, Bailey barged into the room and talked about how Meredith had been breaking the rules since day one, and even though she deserved to be fired over it, she did not deem it fair for her license to be taken away. She concluded Meredith was too good of a surgeon and had worked too hard to get to where she was. Her second testimony and Alex's bringing together a whole group of patients whom Meredith had operated on convinced the panel to let her keep her license. Bailey then told Meredith she could have her job back, which Meredith accepted. They hugged it out.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\nThe Monday after, a few hours before getting an ultrasound to find out the sex of the baby, Bailey found out [[Pruitt Herrera]] had been admitted to the hospital with symptoms suggesting his cancer was back. She ran some tests to confirm. Meanwhile, she convinced Amelia to get an ultrasound, something Amelia had been putting off because she was afraid of what it might reveal given [[Christopher Shepherd|her history]]. Pruitt's tests came back, revealing a highly aggressive testicular lymphoma. While she was talking about his poor survival odds, he told her she was bleeding. Carina was called and she did an ultrasound while Ben was making his way to the hospital. As he arrived, Pruitt and Carina expressed their condolences and gave the couple some privacy. Together, they cried over their loss. After the initial grief had worn off a bit, Bailey decided she needed to work and told Ben to go drink with buddies. On her way to her office, she ran into Amelia, who asked about the ultrasound. Hiding the truth, Bailey told her the baby was a girl like she had expected and headed to her office, where she broke down crying after all.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n[[File:Sx-.jpg|thumb|Bailey finds out Ben is trapped inside the bar.]]\nShe cried over the ultrasound pictures before heading home. While she was trying to get a hold of Ben, she came across Joe's bar, where the Station  crew was working to extract a car that had crashed into Joe's bar, trapping everyone inside. [[Dean Miller]] informed her that Ben was among the people inside though not hurt. She deduced some of her staff were trapped, too, and pressured Dean to get them out. He told her she was wasting his time by barking orders at him while she was not his Chief. He made her step back behind the tape. The crew got everyone out. Ben was unharmed and hugged his wife. He admitted he was blaming himself for the miscarriage as he figured it happened due to the stress that his job was causing her. She told him it was not his fault, pointing out that it happened when he wasn't on duty. She then decided to go back to work and had him update her on her injured residents.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], x (S)</ref>\n\nTogether, they arrived in the ambulance bay as the trauma doctors took in the residents. Bailey granted Ben privileges to help out. Inside, she retreated in a supply closet to gather herself. She found Levi crying in there. She pulled him up and told him their friends needed them. They headed out to work. Owen and Richard came to help out, too. Ben checked if Bailey was okay but she just stated she had operated on her residents before. Richard told her Ben had called him, implying he knew about the miscarriage, but she only told him to help out wherever he could. Together, they operated on [[Taryn Helm]], who had an internal bleed. She froze as she had to open up Taryn's chest to get better visualization so Richard swiftly took over from her. They saved her together and lingered in the OR afterward. He informed her all the residents had made it through their surgeries. She was relieved and finally let the grief over her miscarriage sink in. She told Richard she had handled losing her best surgeons and friends but couldn't handle this loss of her daughter. She had a hard time accepting that, unlike she and her colleagues had done for injured residents, there was nothing she or anyone else could try to save her. As she said she could only stand there and let the loss happen, she broke down in Richard's arm. Later, Richard and Meredith came by her office with tissues and doughnuts to comfort her. Meredith said she felt lonely when she had her miscarriage so she knew Bailey needed some company.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nBailey took some personal time to grieve the loss.\nOn her first day back, Andrew updated her on all the injured resident. As he took her to [[Suzanne Britland]], they ran into Tom, who commented on her taking time off while the majority of the residents were out. Bailey told him she had other services cover their absence and joined Andrew in Suzanne's room. Suzanne had developed a mysterious condition after an appendectomy. Suzanne crashed in the CT machine due a cardiac tamponade but they managed to bring her back. She and Andrew assured Suzanne later that they would find out what was going on. Bailey had Andrew create the war room and reach out to other doctors to get their opinion. Later, she ran into Tom, who again commented on her taking a vacation. She then told him she was grieving her miscarriage. He sympathized with her, having been through two miscarriages with his ex-wife. He said it is not as easy to get over as people make it seem, which is why he had developed a habit of lighting a candle on what would have been the kids' birthdays. Bailey took his advice and lit a candle in the chapel.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, Bailey had to go tell [[Joey Phillips]], whom Ben had rescued the day before, that he would have to be separated from his siblings, who had been placed in the foster system. She overheard that Tom was doing interview with Pac-North staff to determine who would be hired at Grey Sloan. Bailey wanted to make recommendations but he turned her down, knowing she would recommend the people she had impulsively fired. Afterward, she checked in on the residents in the war room on Suzanne's case and told them to go shower. Finally, she went to see Joey and delivered the bad news. She tried to ease the pain by promising to call social services and find out as much as she could about his siblings' situations. She was told that they try to keep siblings together, though Joey wasn't reassured by that as his siblings weren't his actual siblings but rather kids who had run away from their foster home together. As she and Jo operated on Joey's arm to restore blood flow, Bailey brought up his history of bouncing around the foster system after his parents died in a car accident. Despite being a straight-A student who had taken care of his siblings on his own for months, Jo doubted that he would ever be adopted as  year olds are generally viewed as adults who can fend for themselves. After surgery, the two of them watched Joey sleep. Jo hated how he had nowhere to go, though she was hopeful that he would turn out okay like she and Alex had. Later, Bailey sat down with Meredith and they talked about her breaking up with Andrew and having grown up. Jackson came to inform them that Richard had refused to return to Grey Sloan under Koracick's terms. They gathered the top attendings, who all agreed to quit unless Tom agreed to their terms. Tom conceded.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nOn Richard's first day back, Bailey told him to train the new set of residents from Pac-North. She admitted that was her way of comforting him with his marriage ending soon. She also invited him to dinner but he just walked off. Later, Meredith came into Bailey's office as she was having hot flashes. She voiced her concerns over Andrew's behavior regarding Suzanne's case. Bailey called him into her office and told him Meredith would be taking over the case from him so he could finally sleep. Meredith's first decision was putting Suzanne back on her medication, which Andrew and [[Lauren Riley|Dr. Riley]] had stopped as they believed it was masking her symptoms. Andrew aggressively objected to the decision, but Bailey told him to walk away before saying something he would come to regret. Eventually, Andrew found the right diagnosis and Meredith set up the treatment. Later, [[Cormac Hayes]] informed Bailey that Joey was refusing to do his PT. Bailey arranged a visit from his siblings, who assured him their foster homes weren't bad. She ordered pizza for the kids. As she left the room, she was told by a resident that Richard had let them go home, despite it being not even  o'clock. She sat down with Richard, who told her that those residents weren't Grey Sloan caliber. Having them there felt like Catherine had won. She understood and wanted to help him. He told her he was bone tired, which she said sounded like depression. He said he would be okay and left.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\nAs a snowstorm hit Seattle, Bailey continued to spend time with Joey in his hospital room to help him study for his GED. She was mad upon finding out Andrew had taken off on foot to retrieve a donor liver at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital|Seattle Pres]] and got upset with Link for discharging Joey in the middle of a blizzard. She knew Joey had declined to talk to a social worker about his options. She dropped by Joey's room and he told her that, having turned eighteen, he had decided he didn't want to risk ending up with crappy foster parents again. She pointed out he could also end up with a great family that could help him get his high school diploma and find a career that he loved. He didn't think that was in store for him. To prove him wrong, she took him on a tour of the hospital to point all different kinds of jobs. In the ER, they came across Owen and Teddy rushing to save a pregnant woman. Bailey and Joey comforted the woman's wife. Joey followed Bailey as she went to get an update and witnessed how the doctors had managed to save both the woman and her baby. As they watched one mother with her baby in the NICU, Joey admitted he was impressed. Bailey then blurted out that Joey should come home with her, having an extra room and extra love to give. She told him about her son and her husband. He agreed to her offer and they hugged. That night, Ben came home with dinner and was surprised to see Joey in his living room wearing his clothes. Bailey told him they should talk.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nHer unilateral decision angered Ben, who went to sleep on the couch. The next morning, Bailey found a letter from Alex in her mail. He wrote that he wouldn't be returning to Grey Sloan. He thanked her for being a great teacher who also let him grow up. As Alex brought up his difficult past and his turning into the guy that Bailey had trusted to run her hospital and keep her secrets. He also wrote that he had decided to stay in Baldwin City to complete the family Izzie had started by using their embryos to have twins. He asked Bailey if she would be willing to write a recommendation so he could apply for a job of Chief of Peds at Shawnee Memorial. He ended his letter by thanking her again, which he knew was small and lame compared to what she had done for him. Ben came home and found Bailey with the letter in her hand. She informed him that Alex had left everyone behind to be a father. She then said it was a matter of luck that Alex became the person that he is today. He survived his home and foster homes and turned into a father and fine surgeon, all by chance. She didn't want Joey's future to be a matter of chance. Ben then agreed to keep Joey, saying that he had just wanted for them to talk it over. Bailey apologized and they agreed neither of them would make big decisions again without consulting the other.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Bailey found Richard objecting to having his furniture from Pac-North moved into his office. He left to go teach a skills lab, leaving Bailey to handle the dispute with the movers. She arranged for his old furniture to be moved into his office instead but he got mad at her for assuming what he wanted. He told her he would handle it and started throwing stuff on the ground as she left. In the ER, Andrew asked Bailey if he could treat patients now that he had agreed to start seeing a counselor. She denied his request, which surprised him, as he thought she would need the help with Richard handing off his entire service. That was news to Bailey, though she stuck with her decision regarding Andrew. She went to see Richard in his empty office. He apologized and said the slightest things set him off lately. He then formally told her he was stepping back from surgery. He wanted to start something new and said having his old furniture reminded him of his old self and cluttered his mind. Bailey argued that the hospital needed him but he simply said he wanted to step away while at the top of his game. She sat down with Meredith in the attendings' lounge, where Meredith was missing Alex cheering her up after a hard day. Bailey related to the feeling. She recalled Richard's speech to the interns and how she dreamed of being the last one standing. However, now that she was the last one standing, the feelings of victory had worn off and she just felt lonely sometimes. She then informed Meredith that Richard was stepping back from surgery.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>\n\nAndrew convinced Bailey that he was ready to return to work and she allowed him to treat patients again starting with shifts in the clinic. On Meredith's busy pro bono surgery day, Bailey was paged to the clinic by Andrew, who suspected his patient was a human trafficking victim. He made his case stating that Cindy's supposed aunt was answering his questions for her. While Bailey thought he sounded crazy, she went to assess the situation herself. She deemed Cindy and Opal were actually family and told Andrew he was off the case. She also sent him home and told him to meet her in her office the next morning. However, Andrew was persistent and took Cindy to surgery to keep her away from Opal, who ended up finding Cindy anyway. Andrew then went off the rails and physically blocked Opal from getting to Cindy. He drew a crowd as he yelled at Opal to get away. A [[Hospital Codes|code violet]] was called. As his colleagues, including Bailey, arrived, he asked them to form a human chain around Cindy to protect her. Instead, his colleagues formed a human chain around him, indicating they thought of him as the danger, while he yelled at them in an attempt to make them see things his way. Security took him to Bailey's office, where Andrew quit his job rather than accept a suspension. After a talk with Meredith, he agreed to take the suspension if Bailey agreed to call the human trafficking hotline. Bailey agreed and made the call. She was told not to scare the suspects away but found that Opal and Cindy had disappeared, making her fear that Andrew had been right.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nBailey gathered with some other staff in a conference room at Grey Sloan to watch a livestream of Richard's presentation on his PATH pen at the Surgical Innovation Conference in Los Angeles. They all witnessed as he gave an unfocused talk about a cure for cancer with a messy presentation with simple hand-drawn pictures. Maggie and Cormac escorted him off the stage and called .<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nBailey, Meredith, and Amelia assembled a war room to find out what was going on with Richard. Bailey ordered several tests before gathering other doctors. Bailey presented a list with diagnoses that needed ruling out or had been ruled already. During a talk with Richard, they found out he thought Catherine had been at the Conference with him. They added hallucinations to his symptoms. Later in the day, Bailey found Andrew in Richard's room. She reminded him of his suspension but he claimed it was a social visit. She also had him forward her the list that Lauren had sent him. Catherine pushed the doctors to work her. Maggie and Meredith did some cognitive tests on him, which went horribly bad. Maggie was convinced he had some type of rapidly-progressive dementia, though they had yet to find a cause. They returned to Richard's room and found him gone. They spread out to find him. Meredith found him in the OR about to cut himself open. She guided him back to his room. He thought he was at Seattle Grace and wanted to start rounds with the interns. He mentioned Adele, which greatly worried his doctors.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nThe doctors switched off keeping him company. While playing cards, Richard blanked and stopped playing. As he further declined, the doctors kept looking for the reason behind the decline. After a week, Catherine decided it had been enough and she wanted to take Richard home. However, as they were discharging him, Richard mentioned his feet and hands were numb, convincing the doctors to perform an EMG, which revealed that his whole body was breaking down, thus ruling out dementia. The search for a diagnosis continued. Meredith and Bailey went to do a nerve biopsy but Andrew came barging in, knocking over the instrument tray to force them to stop and listen to him. He suspected Richard was suffering from cobalt poisoning caused by his hip replacement. Meredith drew some blood, which confirmed Andrew's suspicion. Andrew asked to scrub in on the hip replacement. Bailey initially denied his request but Meredith pointed out he had made an incredible save, convincing Bailey to let Andrew scrub in to just watch. Bailey went to fetch Link, who was with Amelia giving birth, and convinced him to go perform the surgery. Amelia then asked Bailey to stay with her. Honoring their Pregnancy Club, Bailey stayed with her and helped her through the delivery, much like George had done for her. Later, Link arrived in the room and Bailey showed him his son. She left the new parents and went to check up on Richard in the ICU. He was stable but still unconscious. He later woke up with normal cognitive function.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nMiranda Bailey has two completely different sides, sometimes she is extremely loving and kind, others she is tough and keeps true to her nickname ''the Nazi''. She usually gives advice to others, being very direct.\n\nAlthough known for her strict personality, Bailey has an excellent bedside manner.\n\nAs a resident, Bailey was well-known amongst the attendings for being no-nonsense and unafraid to call them out for what she perceives to be ineptitude. She took time to warm up to new attendings and famously disliked [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Erica Hahn]], [[Mark Sloan]], and [[Arizona Robbins]] for various reasons after working with them for the first time.<ref>[[Wish You Were Here]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n[[Tucker Jones]]\nShe married Tucker Jones c.. They had been married for ten years and trying to conceive for seven when Miranda announced her pregnancy with their first child. Her son, [[William George Bailey Jones]], was born during a [[It's the End of the World|bomb scare]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]] while [[Tucker Jones|her husband]] was in surgery with [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]], having crashed his car on the way to the hospital. [[George O'Malley]] helped her through labor, and she thanked him by naming her son William George Bailey Jones (although he is nicknamed \"Tuck\" after his father).\n\nDue to her working as a surgeon, Bailey rarely spent time at home, putting a strain on their marriage and following an incident where Tuck was hurt at home, their relationship was strained even more and although they stayed married, Tucker went on dates.\n\nOn discovering Miranda had applied for a pediatric surgery fellowship, Tucker gave her an ultimatum: the fellowship or their marriage. Miranda decided to leave her husband, believing a marriage should never come to an ultimatum, but also declined the fellowship.\n\n[[Sam Bennett]]\nWhile she was still married, he flirted with her.<ref>[[Before and After]], x</ref> When she came to L.A., he almost kissed her. She stopped him and returned home before anything could happen between them.<ref>[[Right Here, Right Now]], x (PP)</ref>\n\n[[Ben Warren]]\nAfter her divorce from Tucker was finalized, Bailey started seeing Ben, an anesthesiologist.<ref>[[Valentine's Day Massacre]], x</ref>\n\nBut after the shooting at Seattle Grace, she broke off her relationship with him, saying she had to put herself back together.<ref>[[With You I'm Born Again]], x</ref>\n\nWhen drunk, she confessed that she still missed Ben.<ref>[[Slow Night, So Long]], x</ref>\n\nDuring their time apart, Bailey dated another man, but after Ben found out, he decided to fight for her and things ended between Bailey and Eli.<ref>[[Love, Loss and Legacy]], x</ref>\n\nAfter things ended with Eli, she got back together with Ben.\n\nBen tried to propose to her through a crossword puzzle which didn't work out like he planned, and in the end Miranda herself asked him to marry her twice.<ref>[[Migration]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day they were supposed to get married, Bailey got caught up with [[Adele Webber]] when she and Richard found out that Adele was coughing up blood and had been rushed to the hospital. They turned the limo that was taking them to the wedding around and went to the hospital instead.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nBailey and Meredith operated on Adele, before returning to her wedding and tying the knot with Ben.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nAfter their marriage, Ben had gotten a surgical internship at UCLA and had to leave. Their marriage was strained while he was at UCLA, but Ben came to Seattle to vist Miranda every once in a while. Later, Ben quit his job because he felt he didn't see Miranda or Tuck, his stepson. Miranda was not very happy at first, but he did not want to give up surgery and got a job at Grey Sloan Memorial. \n\nBen operated on a man in the psych ward with a clipboard and operated on a pregnant women without proper consent in a hall and she died. He was put on probation for  months by Miranda. Instead of not doing any work, he acted as an attending anesthesiologist which angered Miranda because she felt that he wasn't taking his probation seriously, but she couldn't do anything about it, as she wasn't in control over the anesthesiologist department. \n\nHe later became a firefighter, which scared Miranda as he was the one running into the fire, not running away. Because of the stress of his job, one day when he was going to work, she told him to drop her off at Seattle Presbyterian hospital. She told him that it was a meeting and blew him off, so he just dropped her off and drove to his job. \n\nWhen he was told that she was having a heart attack, Ben dropped his hot dogs and ran to the hospital, freaking out. He was with her when she woke up, as was Maggie Pierce and Richard Webber. Ben told her that he would quit for her but Miranda told him not to, as his job did stress him out, but she knew that this was what he wanted to do. \n\n[[Eli Lloyd]]\nEli, a nurse, asked her out, and the two dated for a while, even to the extent of sleeping together in the on-call room, something which Miranda never actually thought she would do, given her stellar reputation.\n\nAfter Ben returned, she dumped Eli. Even before Ben returned, Miranda admitted she wasn't looking for a long-term relationship with Eli.\n\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nMiranda had a strained relationship with Meredith in the beginning because of Meredith's relationship with Derek, but they soon became friendly. They also worked on a medical trial to try to cure diabetes together, although Bailey refused to allow her to help at first because of what happened with Derek's Alzheimer's trial. Eventually, Bailey became close with Meredith, even demanding that Meredith be a bridesmaid in her wedding to [[Ben Warren|Ben]]. After the wedding, they remained close.\n\n[[Cristina Yang]]\nBailey said that Cristina was the one intern she didn't have to worry about.\n\n[[Izzie Stevens]]\nIzzie was not her favorite in the beginning. Then when Izzie cut Denny's L-VAD wire, Bailey really had a disliking for her. When Izzie got cancer, Bailey softened up. Bailey once accused her of being too \"attached\" to her patients. \n\nWhen Izzie went under for brain surgery for her cancer, she had been knitting a scarf earlier. Before Izzie went down, she told Bailey that the scarf was for her. \n\n[[George O'Malley]]\nBailey said [[Heart-Shaped Box|George was her favorite]] of her interns. She also named [[William George Bailey Jones|her son]] after him. He coached her through her labor and delivery, allowing her to work through the stress of her husband's car accident.\n\nWhen George told her he was joining the army, Bailey freaked out, and with the help of other doctors, they staged an \"intervention\" to stop him from going. Owen told them that it was his choice, but they started blaming Owen for him joining the army because he encouraged George a lot with trauma surgery and talked about his experiences in the army. \n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShe thinks Alex was made to be a peds surgeon. After learning of Alex's past from his younger brother, Bailey says she is impressed Alex became a doctor, due to his troubled upbringing. She also remarks on how impressing her is not an easy feat.\n\n[[Richard Webber]]\nWebber has been her mentor since she was a resident, and has encouraged her to become the person she is today. Bailey looks up to Webber. \n\nOthers\nThrough the rest of that residency year, Bailey had to adjust to becoming a parent and reconciling this with her desire to continue her career as a surgeon. Her professional confidence was shaken when [[Izzie Stevens]] cut Denny Duquette's [[Ventricular assist device|LVAD]] wire and Denny subsequently died after his heart transplant; Bailey felt that she wasn't in control of her interns and that the incident was ultimately her fault. She was criticized for the events at a Morbidity and Mortality conference, with one colleague questioning outright her competence at juggling career and motherhood. While her confidence has been somewhat restored since then, she still feels bad about not spending enough time with her son, once making a late-night call to sing \"God Bless the Child\" to him. During her pregnancy, she was upset that her interns had driven away two residents and no one wanted them. When she returned to work, she was making sure that her colleagues knew that she hadn't gone soft because she had become a mother.\n\nFollowing severe injuries to her son and several arguments over the state of their marriage, Bailey and her husband separated because her husband believed that she placed her job at the hospital before her family and that it led to Tuck's injuries. Bailey's relationship with [[Erica Hahn]] is quite strained. Although Erica saved her son's life, she temporarily stopped the surgery until Bailey left and when Bailey asked Erica for help on a surgery, the whole day Erica was quite negative and kept putting Bailey down.\n\n\nMiranda Bailey, a graduate of [[Wellesley College]], is an [[attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]]. She says she was the only female intern in her year, but she was the best and she won the first solo surgery. She was also previously in charge of the five interns Meredith, Cristina, Izzie, Alex, and George (although Alex was not originally hers). Her colleagues used to refer to her as \"The Nazi\" because of her tough personality and blunt attitude although she behaves almost in the exact opposite way with patients and has a great bedside manner.\n\nAlthough she was often harsh with her interns, she has been shown to provide both support and advice when they need it; practicing \"tough love.\" For instance, Bailey stayed by Cristina during her pregnancy scare and her initial recovery; she also held Izzie's hand when Izzie was giving bone marrow for her daughter. She cares about her patients and is a committed surgeon. When she first learned about Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd she became brisk with her but it was to prove Meredith had no favor. She protected her while she was looked at by all the Seattle Grace when Derek choose Addison over her, she admitted he had put himself between two remarkable women.\n\nDisillusioned by how little she can help patients as a surgeon, Bailey decided to open a free clinic at Seattle Grace. She faced initial difficulties getting support from the attendings, but after talking with the Chief, managed to get their agreement to work there. The Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic has since opened, paid for using part of the $. million bequeathed to Izzie by [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny Duquette]], and Bailey is satisfied that the clinic will change people's lives for the better. She competed for the post of Chief Resident, but she found out she lost to [[Callie Torres]]. [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] has indicated that she could eventually become Chief of Surgery.\n\nMiranda became a th-year resident and decided to be Callie's \"number two,\" as Torres was lacking in performance as Chief Resident. The Chief saw Bailey pick up the slack, and delegate exceptionally well, and eventually realized that Miranda was covering for Callie. He fired Torres from the position and told Bailey that he made a mistake in not giving her the job in the first place. He also apologized for taking Dr. Bailey for granted. At this Miranda broke down in tears hugged the Chief. This is an example of the emotional baggage the \"Nazi\" carries and shows one of her very rare emotional moments. Miranda helped save the life of a white supremacist paramedic despite his racist treatment of her. When closing his stomach after the surgery, she comments to George that the incision will need to be aligned better, thus ruining the paramedic's large swastika tattoo on his stomach. During the surgery, she declared that she didn't want to be called the Nazi anymore.\n\n[[Image:x-.JPG|thumb|left|px|Bailey pregnant.]]\n\nDr. Bailey was nearing the end of her surgical residency in [[General Surgery]], and Richard Webber had planned for her to become a general surgery attending. Although for a while she claimed she was growing tired of appys and gall bladders and nothing excited her but while treating a child that almost died, she wanted to stick with general surgery. Unfortunately, she had been assigned to another child. While treating the child, both Dixon and Robbins said she was a true pediatric surgeon because of her disregard of rules, her personal interest in patients and taking the time to explain surgeries to the patients and the children. Privately, she told Arizona how she felt when her son Tuck was admitted and said, because of how she felt, it would make her bad for pediatric surgery. But in contrast, Arizona told her that in her opinion it made her uniquely qualified. Eventually, she decided to pursue a pediatric surgery fellowship, despite the Chief's disagreement. Armed with letters of recommendation from [[Derek Shepherd|Shepherd]], [[Mark Sloan|Sloan]], [[George O'Malley|O'Malley]], and a disappointing letter from [[Richard Webber|the chief]], she is very excited about [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison's]] letter of recommendation, labeling her the \"the most promising peds surgeon I've ever had the pleasure of working with\". Even though Arizona claims the Chief is the major factor in the decision, the implication of Addison's referral should make a much larger difference than any other doctor she could have, as Addison is a world-class neonatal surgeon, hopefully outranking most other letters of recommendation Bailey has.\n\nBailey eventually gains the pediatric surgery fellowship, and even the Chief signs on and agrees with it, but Bailey is unable to take the position and asks for a job as a General Surgery attending, after making the decision to leave her husband, as a fellowship for  years of long hours is not healthy for a single mother.\n\nAs a general surgery attending, Bailey spearheads an initiative to reduce post-operative fistula formations. After introducing a new protocol that involves the removal of a drain on day  versus day , the formation is reduced by %.\n\nWith Richard stepping down as Chief of Surgery, Miranda appeared livid, when Owen Hunt was ushered into the position, however, she eventually supports this decision. Bailey later admitted that she thought she would have eventually become Chief of Surgery after him.<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\nAlong with stepping down from his position, Dr. Webber passed on his clinical trial on diabetes to her. Along the way, Richard kept insisting that Bailey have [[Meredith Grey]] help her, which she refused because she partly blamed Meredith for Richard's downfall. Eventually, Bailey hit a rough patch in her own research and begun shutting out Webber from their lab of mice. Though she employed [[April Kepner]] to assist her, it was not until Meredith began working on the case that the problem was finally discovered. Meredith discovered that parts of her mother's research were wrong and that the first few devices installed in their first patients would eventually become ineffective. After [[Teddy Altman|Teddy's]] husband [[Henry Burton]] dies, the trial was not mentioned again.\n\nBailey later pursued\uaa new project of genome mapping that will arm doctors the necessary information to treat diseases at the source rather than treating the symptoms as they arise. A while after, because of defective gloves, she unintentionally infected three of her patients with a staph infection and was investigated by the CDC. While her name was eventually cleared and her infection was eradicated and all three patients died, she overheard Richard telling a patient that the one doctor who caused the infection had been isolated. This affected Bailey greatly, causing her to lock herself in her genome lab, shutting out the other doctors, particularly the board and Richard, for a day while she obsessively mapped her own genome over and over again. She was drawn out only by her husband, Ben, but she still refused to perform surgeries, until she had to operate on Meredith.\n\nAfter Owen decided to step down as Chief of Surgery, Richard suggested Bailey as his successor to the board, but Catherine didn't want him to just give her the position. They agreed on her bringing in one outside candidate,\ua[[Tracy McConnell|Dr. Tracy McConnell]], but Bailey convinced the board to choose her by talking about how passionate she was about the hospital. As of now, Bailey is one of the few female Chiefs of Surgery.\n\n\n*Bailey was the only female intern in her year. She also won the first solo surgery.\n*Bailey states in [[Deny, Deny, Deny]] that her cystic fibrosis patient [[Jeremiah Tate]] has been her patient for at least five years. However, she was later established as being a th-year resident at the time.\n**At the time of the episode airing, Bailey's year of residency had not been established, though it had been originally implied she was a th-year, as she discussed fellowship decisions during her pregnancy in the same season and was in charge of the OR in the [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|first season]]. Late in the [[Season  (Grey's Anatomy)|third season]], Bailey was established to be a th-year surgical resident, and the first three seasons take place in one year, following the [[Timeline|timeline being retconned]]. \n***However, Bailey states in [[The Time Warp]] (which takes place early  when [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] is a third-year resident and Bailey an attending after finishing residency in ) that she began her internship in . This would have made her a resident for five years during Meredith's intern year, somewhat corroborating the original comment in [[Deny, Deny, Deny]], but it would also mean she did residency for six years.\n*Bailey states to Derek she has been married for ten years in the Season  episode [[Bring the Pain]]. She and Richard both later recall in Season 's [[I Was Made for Lovin' You]] that Richard and his wife [[Adele Webber|Adele]] attended her first wedding. If not a timeline mistake, this means Webber had not met Bailey on her first day of internship but rather has known Bailey for at least  years at that point (likely when she was a college student).

''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhile back in Seattle visiting her parents, her son, Milo, swallowed a chew toy, which became stuck in his bronchus. She took him to the Grey Sloan Memorial ER, where they located the toy and used bronchoscopy to remove it. While she was at the hospital, she warned Jo about Alex's history, but once she realized he really had changed, she told Alex Jo was too good for him, which he already knew.

They lived into adulthood without being separated, but as adults, they looked into separation. They decided against it initially because Pete was scared of the risks, but then six months later, they reconsidered because Jake had fallen in love with [[Elena]] and wanted to be able to be with her without his brother coming along. They'd had a fight over Pete taking Elena's side in an argument and Pete accidentally touching Elena while she and Jake were having sex.\n\nThe doctors set up dummies that represented Jake and Pete and practice the surgery. [[Derek Shepherd]] thought the surgery was too risky, but he was convinced to go ahead. Despite a problem during surgery, each of them had two functioning legs and were successfully separated.\n\nAfterward, in recovery, Elena came to see Pete, but he was disinterested in her. He was put in a room with his brother and they started to make-up with each other, holding hands when their beds were pushed together.\n\n\n\nHe had feelings for his brother's girlfriend, [[Elena]]. She reciprocated the feelings, but also loved Jake.\n\n\nHe was born conjoined to his brother, Jake. They had rules that governed their lives and helped keep the peace between them.

When they saw George cleaning out his locker, they went to check out the cafeteria. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nOn his first day as an intern, he was assigned to [[Alex Karev]], who took them on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thatcher Grey]] came in drunk and kept asking for Dr. Grey, Pierce came to get Alex because he didn't know what do to. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. Karev said that he wanted to dump Pierce because he hated saying the name.\ua''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural as practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Mark broke his penis, the interns watched his surgery and gossiped about how it had happened. Sadie confessed to it being her, despite it actually being Lexie. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Warren Kramer]] came into the ER with an object lodged in his rectum, Steve, Pierce, and Ryan all laughed over his predicament. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. [[Lexie Grey]] ended up winning the contest.\ua''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns worked on Patient X (actually Izzie using her own scans and labs) and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended Alex and Izzie's wedding. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen George died, Pierce attended the funeral. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program.\n\nCristina had Pierce, Megan, and Leo spy on the Chief for her and report back what they saw. Pierce was ultimately cut as part of the first round of layoffs. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nPierce participated in a documentary someone was making about the doctors from the hospital. He was interviewed even though he was only working in the morgue. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] once considered using him to \"scratch an itch\", asking [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] if he was clean, but later decided against it.\n\n[[Megan Nowland]]\nPierce was dating [[Megan Nowland|Megan]] at some point, but they broke up, when she found a nurse's number on him, and then got back together. During their break, Megan slept with [[Steve Mostow|Steve]], and Steve accidentally sent an email to people about their hookup, including Pierce. According to [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]], Pierce wants to kill Steve, but it appears that Steve has punched Pierce, with Pierce having a black eye and Steve having a bloody hand. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nPierce and [[Alex Karev|Alex]] have a mutual dislike for each other. When Alex was trying to decide which intern to give to George, he considered Pierce because he didn't like the name.\n\nLater, after operating on [[Sadie Harris|Sadie]], Alex told the interns he didn't respect them but Pierce noted that he still respected Izzie, even though she killed [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|a patient]].\n\n\nOriginally one of [[Alex Karev|Alex Karev's]] [[Internship|interns]], he was later reassigned to George O'Malley. He was part of the secret intern society.\n\nDuring his second year of [[Resident|residency]], Pierce was part of the first round of lay-offs when [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] merged.\n\nPierce is now working in the morgue at Seattle Grace. But he doesn't appear to be too happy about his new job, referring to it as \" working in the underbelly of Seattle Grace\" and that he hates it.

They told him it was okay to be scared and then inserted the needle to remove the blood.\n\nAfter he was stable, they pulled Ray out of the rig and took him into surgery. Despite a complication, Ray survived. Sara came to see him after surgery and was told that the hope was he'd be just fine. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nRay brought in [[Clara Ferguson]] after both her arms and one of her legs were traumatically amputated in a speedboating accident. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nRay brought in Frank Newsbaum after he was stabbed repeatedly. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nRay brought in Bobby Corso, a morbidly obese patient complaining of stomach pain. ''(\"[[How Insensitive]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Jared Swork opened fire on Pacific College, Ray was a paramedic who responded. He unknowingly treated Jared and took him to the hospital. ''(\"[[Disarm]]\")''\n\n\nWhen a roller coaster derailed and injured several people, Ray brought in [[Dean Parson]], who had been injured blocking kids from injury. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing to determine if she would lose her medical license, Ray was among those who testified on her behalf. He talked about the ambulance crash and how Meredith crawled into the ambulance and saved his life. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n\n\nHe and [[Stan Giamatti]] were partners and best friends until Stan's death. Ray was there when Stan met his wife, [[Sara Giamatti|Sara]]. After Stan's death, Sara came to visit Ray in the hospital.\n\n\nHe is a paramedic in Seattle.

He was admitted for tests. He had fluid in his abdomen due to his liver disease that was pressing on his lung. The liver disease was caused by his frequent alcohol consumption. Izzie and Cristina did a paracentesis to drain the fluid. They were nervous about the procedure as neither of them had done one before, but they did it anyway. They drained a significant amount of fluid and then noticed that he had no pulse. They called a code, but they were unable to save him.\n\nWorried that they might have done something wrong, they did an autopsy even though they were unable to convince the family to ask for one. Bailey interrupted their autopsy, but by then, they'd discovered that his heart was enlarged. They took a sample of the grainy material inside his heart to run tests. They discovered hemochromatosis, which had caused his death and had made him sick for many years prior to then.

She was brought to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] where she bonded with [[Alex Karev|Alex]] but later left when she recovered her memories. She later reappeared and although they loved each other, she slit her wrists and almost died, thus Alex was forced to have her transferred to a psychiatric facility.\n\n\n\nAlex Karev found a semi-conscious pregnant woman crushed under a cement pylon, suffering from several severe injuries, after the ferry accident. He rode to the hospital with her in the ambulance. He had to put her on her side to improve her circulation.\n[[Image:x-.jpg|thumb|left|px|Ava after the crash.]]\nUpon arrival at Seattle Grace, the Jane Doe was submitted to a battery of tests and surgeries to evaluate her condition and that of her baby, as well as treat her injuries. She was then taken into surgery to start repairing some of the damage. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\nScans showed a cardiac tamponade, which was treated during surgery. During surgery, her baby started having late decels, but Addison was able to control it and Burke finished the surgery. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nShe woke up after her surgery confused. She thought that Alex was her husband and they quickly realized that she had no memory of her life before the accident. She was worried about not knowing anything about her life, so Alex used her labs to tell her what they'd learned about her. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\nBecause of the damage to her face, she was difficult to identify and there was no match on her prints. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\n\nShe had a fracture to her orbital socket, meaning she needed surgery. [[Mark Sloan]] said it needed to happen as soon as possible, but [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]] recommended that they wait a day or two to minimize risk to her baby. Rebecca decided to have the surgery immediately. During the surgery, the baby went into distress and Jane Doe had vaginal bleeding. Addison was called in and she had to do a cervical cerclage. After her surgery, her sight was safe. ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\n\nEventually, [[Mark Sloan]] presented Jane Doe with options for her facial reconstruction. She had trouble choosing because none of them looked familiar and she didn't want to pick the wrong one. Alex helped her with the decision by assigning each face a name and identity. Jane Doe chose the face Alex called \"Ava\", and adopted the moniker for herself following the surgery. ''(\"[[My Favorite Mistake]]\")''\n\n\nAfter her facial reconstruction was completed and the bandages off, they took some pictures of her to get them out. A couple ([[Joan Waring|Joan]] and [[Frank Waring]]) came to the hospital thinking that Jane Doe was their daughter,\uaShannon Marie.\uaShe matched the basic description of their daughter,\uaso she allowed them to come in and see her. She asked if she could go home with them. Alex said he'd look into it, but it fell through when Joan realized that Jane Doe wasn't actually her daughter. After they left, Alex had to break the news to her. She was upset at still not knowing who she was and caused a fight between Alex and herself. ''(\"[[Time After Time]]\")''\n\n\nAva developed pre-eclampsia and the baby developed edema. She was given an epidural in an attempt to stabilize her, but she had a seizure, so she was rushed to the OR for an emergency c-section even though she was only  weeks pregnant. Ava started to panic after the birth because there was additional bleeding. However, Alex was able to calm her down while Addison finished the surgery. ''(\"[[Desire]]\")''\n\n\nBecause her more emergency health issues were addressed and her memory had still not come back, [[Derek Shepherd]] agreed to look more seriously into possible causes for the memory loss. By this point, Ava was able to get up and walk around. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nDerek found bleeding in her brain, which he said could have been from one of her other surgeries. She needed brain surgery, but he warned her that due to the location of the bleed, she needed to be awake during the surgery. He said there was a chance she could get her memory back from the surgery. Alex had her identify the items on cards while Derek stimulated different parts of her brain. They learned that she speaks German, Spanish, and French. When she woke up after surgery, she was upset that her memory had not come back. She worried about what would happen if she never remembered her life. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part ]]\")''\n\nWhile helping Alex study for his intern exam, Ava remembered her dad's face. Alex was excited, but Ava minimized it, saying it was nothing. Alex went to Derek and asked him to run tests. When Alex tried to run the tests, Ava refused to cooperate. He then figured out that her memory had come back and she was lying to him about it. She said she was in an unhappy marriage with a nice guy. She was upset because he hadn't come to look for her while she was missing. She later told Alex that her name was Rebecca Pope. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\n\nRebecca's husband, Jeff, came to the hospital to get her. Rebecca was cleared by all her doctors to go home and her baby was discharged. However, she told Alex to give her a reason to stay. He left after saying she should stay with Jeff. By the time he returned, having changed his mind, she had left with her husband. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n\nRebecca came back to Seattle to see Alex on Halloween. She said the only thing she'd wanted to be for Halloween was Ava. He kissed her deeply. They went to an on-call room, where Rebecca said that she was upset that Alex hadn't come for her. They still went on to have sex. Afterward, Alex was paged away. When he returned, Rebecca was gone, but had left a piece of her clothing. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\nRebecca came back again and Alex let her sneak into the gallery to watch a surgery, even though it was against the rules. When Lexie came in and sat down next to her, Rebecca told Lexie who she was. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\nMark later saw her there and busted Alex. Alex got suspended for a week over it. He told Rebecca that he believed she was just playing dress-up coming to Seattle. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\nRebecca came back again, saying she was pregnant. Alex asked her if she was keeping it or having an abortion and then left abruptly. She went down to the clinic, where the did a pregnancy test. Alex later came back and placed his hand on her belly, not knowing that the pregnancy test had come back negative. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\nAlex got a second job at [[Emerald City Bar]] in order to help him save up money so he and Rebecca could get a place together.\n\nRebecca came into the hospital wanting to get a consult from Mark Sloan. Izzie found her and informed her that the pregnancy test had been negative, but Rebecca didn't believe her. At the consult with Mark, she said she wanted a new body because it didn't match the face he made her. He said he couldn't operate because she said she was pregnant. Mark told Izzie they might be looking at Acute Stress Disorder as a result of her facial reconstruction. He told Izzie to make it clear to her that she was not pregnant and get her a psych consult. Izzie did an ultrasound and showed Rebecca that there was nothing in her uterus. Rebecca then thought she had lost the baby, despite being told she never was pregnant. Instead of getting the psych consult, Alex brought her home so he could take care of her. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\nAlex continued to take care of Rebecca, feeding her and bathing her while she remained in an almost catatonic state. Later, when he left her unattended with a knife to answer a phone call, she slit her wrists. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\nAlex brought her into the ER to stitch up her wrists. He insisted that he could still handle it, but Izzie had technically admitted her, so she called for a psych consult. Alex sent away the consult, but called her husband, who said he'd taken the baby and left her two months ago. He went to Rebecca and said that she had underlying borderline personality disorder that was aggravated by her face being changed. He said she'd spend the night in the hospital and then be transferred to a psychiatric facility. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nAfter Alex realized she had regained her memory, he tried to convince her to tell the authorities so that her family could be located; although she initially refused, she eventually confessed that her real name was Rebecca Pope. This finally led her husband, [[Jeff Pope]], to reunite with her, and though Rebecca pleaded with Alex to \"give me a reason to stay\", he refused and told her to stay with the better guy, only to regret his decision later, but it was too late: Rebecca and her daughter had left with Jeff, leaving Alex to stare at an empty room. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\nRebecca reappeared. Rebecca explained to Alex that in her town at Halloween, all the mothers dressed up. She confessed that the only person she wanted to be was Ava. Alex kissed Rebecca and the two proceeded to an [[On-Call Room]]. Alex made a move to have sex, but Rebecca stopped him, telling him he was a 'chicken' and 'didn't come looking for her'. She told him that she 'had to come looking for him'. The two eventually had sex and Rebecca alluded to the fact she no longer loves her husband. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\nA while later, Rebecca returned again to see Alex. She invited him to have coffee, but he turned her down due to a surgery. Rebecca begged him to let her watch it, and she dressed as a resident to have Alex sneak her into the gallery, where Lexie met her and found out about Alex's \"other girlfriend,\" and both Izzie and Mark discovered her. Alex was suspended from the [[Operating Room|O.R.]] for two weeks and later in his bedroom as Rebecca kissed him, he yelled at her, telling her that she was only at Seattle Grace \"to play dress up\" and that she should go back to her life so he could get on with his. However, after this angry speech, he continued to kiss her and they slept together.\n\nAbout six weeks later, Rebecca came back to Seattle Grace once again with news for Alex\ushe was pregnant. Alex was reluctant at first to have anything to do with her or the baby, but eventually he accepted it and excitedly began to build a new life for him, the baby, and Rebecca, who left to tell her husband she was leaving him. However, Izzie discovered that she was not actually pregnant and she had even temporarily forgotten she already had a baby. Alex eventually saw that Rebecca indeed was not pregnant, and became slightly worried when she didn't listen to him and instead insisted that she lost the baby. He took her home and decided to take care of her, disregarding Izzie's observations that Rebecca \"isn't looking very good.\"\n\nRebecca sank into depression after learning that \"she lost the baby\" and Alex was adamant that he could take care of her. However, when he was in another room, she attempted to cut her wrists with a kitchen knife. Alex brought her to the [[Emergency Room|ER]] and got even angrier at Izzie when she tried to get Rebecca a psych consult so she could be admitted. Izzie finally stood her ground and got Rebecca a psych consult. Later, Alex called Jeff Pope and discovered that two months earlier, he took the baby girl and left Rebecca. Rebecca was eventually put into psych. When Alex told her, she accepted it, but told him she was trying to be better for him. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n[[Jeff Pope]]\nShe was married to Jeff Pope. They met in college and got married the year after they graduated. She wanted to move to New York, but he wanted to live on the side of a mountain and take over his father's woodworking shop. She says she was going out of her mind in her marriage, which is why she left. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nHe later left her and took the baby. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nHer daughter has her father's nose. ''(\"[[Testing --]]\")''\n\nWhen she came to Seattle on Halloween, she said her daughter was perfect. She sucked on her fingers and made a cartoon-like suckling sound. She was soothed by being wrapped in a shirt her mother had been wearing.

However, Izzie blew off the appointment. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\nAfter Izzie accepted treatment and was admitted, Swender took over her care. She made it clear that all the other doctors working on her case answered to her. When Derek went to remove Izzie's brain mets, Swender observed and questioned his ability to remove the mets without killing her. Despite her questioning, the surgery was successful. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\nIzzie started chemo and was planning Meredith and Derek's wedding. Swender wanted her to save her energy because the IL was highly toxic and she'd eventually hit a wall, which she did later that day. ''(\"[[Sweet Surrender]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek wanted to remove Izzie's hippocampus to remove a brain met that couldn't be removed another way, Swender protested that, saying it could damage her memory and she should just continue with the IL instead. Derek agreed to do a test that might determine what her memory would look like after the surgery. Izzie didn't pass the memory test, but he wanted to do the surgery anyway. Izzie decided not to have the surgery under pressure from Meredith. However, she changed her mind after Alison Clark died, though she signed a DNR before surgery. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\nWhen Izzie's cancer stopped growing, Swender wasn't interested anymore and passed Izzie's case off to [[E. Gendall]]. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n\nWhen another patient of hers named [[Alison Clark]] (also with stage IV cancer)\uadeveloped complications, Cristina scrubbed in with Dr. Swender to try to save her. Despite that, Alison suffered brain damage and was unable to come off the ventillator. Despite being a surgeon herself, Dr. Swender justified to Cristina why chemotherapy and other non-surgical treatments are often\uamore effective than surgery in treating cancer. For example, she stated that when Alison Clark was referred to her, she had only three months to live. However, chemotherapy kept her alive for two years. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Alison Clark came into the hospital with her husband, Gary, after collapsing at the grocery store, Swender did a biopsy that showed that her cancer was back.

She was osteoporotic, which is why it was crushed. They ran labs to figure out why she had osteoporosis so young. She was missing vital nutrients and they asked if she'd been dieting. She said she'd just lost  pounds because Will said that if she got back down to a size four and he quit smoking, they'd move in together. They said she needed to make lifestyle changes in order to prevent this from happening again.\n\nWhen they were explaining her surgery to her, they said that healing would take longer if she didn't start eating more.

For the lab, Owen stabbed four live pigs and told the doctors to save their lives. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural to practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting outside an on-call room trying to get some sleep, Dani, Steve, and Ryan heard a loud, painful moan when Mark broke his penis. Later, while they watched his surgery, they gossiped about who might have broken it. Sadie eventually confessed, despite it actually being Lexie. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Warren Kramer]] came into the ER with an object lodged in his rectum, Steve, Pierce, and Ryan all laughed over his predicament. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. Ryan, Lexie, and Steve reached the finish line at the same time, but Lexie gave the correct diagnosis, making her the winner. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nRyan survived the first round of cutbacks, but was worried when the Mercy West residents started at the newly-merged hospital. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n\nHe participated in a documentary someone was making about doctors at the hospital.

''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\n\nOn her first day, Sadie joined the interns practicing procedures on each other. She encouraged them to use fewer pain meds in order to avoid detection. She cut her own shoulder and offered to let them stitch it up. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering the interns. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\n\nSadie agreed to let one of the other interns cut out her appendix on the condition she could do the same for one of them. Lexie agreed and started to operate with an epidural. When they got to the appendix, they saw that it was inflamed, meaning it wasn't routine. Sadie also had severe hemorrhaging. They called Meredith and Cristina in, who finished the surgery with the help of Bailey, needing to remove a portion of her cecum to stop the bleeding. After the surgery, Sadie was put on probation with all the other interns. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nSadie examined [[Holly Anderson]] in the ER and failed to notice signs of a basilar skull fracture, which ultimately led to her death. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhile working on the case of [[Jackson Prescott]], Sadie noticed a black spot on his duodenum, meaning the organs weren't suitable for transplant.

''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Mark broke his penis, the interns watched his surgery and gossiped about who had done it. Sadie saw how uncomfortable Lexie was, so she confessed despite knowing it was Lexie. She also guarded the door so Lexie could be with Mark after his surgery. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nLeo, Sadie, and Megan all had to work with Izzie in the clinic for a day. When they did procedures on patients, she also had them perform them on her. Sadie ended up mislabeling a patient's blood sample with the sample taken from Izzie.''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. Sadie incorrectly draped her patient and had to start over. She later cheated by listening in when Lexie \"diagnosed\" Mark. She also pointed the ultrasound wand at [[Jen Harmon|Jen Harmon's]] baby's butt instead of his heart. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nHer mistakes drew suspicion from George, who worried about her knowledge lagging behind where it should be. He offered to help her catch up, but she said she didn't need a tutor. George told her she could go to the Chief herself or he could. Rather than be known as a cheater, Sadie quit and left the hospital. Before leaving, she tried to convince Meredith to come with her and start travelling again to be free, but Meredith declined. It's possible that Sadie decided to travel on her own.\ua''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Callie Torres]] suspected that Sadie was flirting with her but she was never sure. Callie found her to be attractive. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhen traveling around Europe with [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], they had a fight in Amsterdam. They made up, but never were as close as before. When Cristina and Meredith were fighting, Sadie advised Meredith to apologize to prevent it from happening again with someone else. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\nHer arrival in [[Seattle]] caused some friction between herself and [[Cristina Yang]], as Yang is jealous of their close relationship. She formed a friendship with [[Lexie Grey]], after deciding that she \"maybe isn't such a priss\" and looking for allies. She proved her friendship to Lexie when she pretended to be the one to \"''break''\" [[Mark Sloan|Mark's]] penis, when the interns laughed at Lexie.\n\n\n[[File:Sadiecutsherself.jpg|thumb|left|px|Interns perform a surgery on Sadie.]]\nShe delayed her residency by working in a morgue before starting her internship at [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]]. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nKnowing that she is not \"book smart,\" she came to Seattle Grace hoping Meredith could help her get through her internship.\n\nSadie began a friendship with fellow intern Lexie Grey, despite Meredith's warning that Lexie was naive, sheltered, and the kind of girl who grew up with \"parents and rules and smiley face posters on her wall.\" Joining the group of Seattle Grace surgical interns starving for a chance to practice their skills, Sadie volunteered herself for an appendectomy, so the other interns could practice and learn how to perform the procedure, provided she was given a chance afterwards at performing another procedure herself. Sadie's life was seriously endangered when the surgery went wrong, though fortunately Meredith and Cristina managed to save her. She was put on probation, along with the other interns, and rebuked by Meredith for her poor judgment, though later she told Lexie that she is not sorry. To try to let Lexie off her punishment, Sadie told the chief that the appendectomy was her idea and her own fault, but the chief said that the decision was up to him, telling her that the only reason she was still at the hospital was because of her father.\n\nSadie participated in [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie's]] game/competition for the interns, though her limited knowledge caused her to make serious mistakes in many of the tasks, such as draping a patient completely wrong for a [[Medical Glossary#W|whipple]] and using the doppler at \"the fetus's ass\" to find a heartbeat on an ultrasound. [[George O'Malley|George]] noticed that Sadie was falling behind and asked her to talk to the chief, finally giving her an ultimatum - talk to the chief, or he will. As a result, Sadie quit, with George hinting to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] that she may have cheated her way into the surgical program.

They shared a memory of when Stan met Sara and started singing \"I Can See Clearly Now.\"\n\nWhen Sara arrived, they talked for a few minutes and said goodbye. Sara then had to be pulled away by a firefighter so that they could get into the rig to get Ray out.

Steve had his first parentless Halloween in . He trick-or-treated with his sister. It was dusk and drizzling and they decided to go to Mr. C's house. Mr. C lived down the street from them and was famous for two things--dentures and the Halloween house. Each year he transformed his colonial style home into a haunted-palooza, and himself into Monster C. Steve had a longstanding theory that Monster C was simply Mr. C sans the dentures. And as a young scientist/future doctor he was excited to check out the inside of his mouth and the state of his toothless gums. However, he opened the door as a full-toothed bizarro version of Bozo the Clown popped out from the spider web, frizzy red hair and all. And it was then that they realized that the \"C\" in Monster C stood for clown. Cindy was afraid of clowns and ran screaming from the house. He claimed not to be afraid, but he ran with Cindy. Unfortunately, a boy named Mitch Donovan, who was egging Mr. C's car, saw them and continued to call Steve, ''Scarecrow Steve'' all the way through high school.\n\n\nOn his first day, he was assigned to [[Cristina Yang]]. Cristina took the group on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules. However, her speech was derailed when her pager didn't go off as she told the interns to move when she moves.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n\nSteve worked in the clinic for a day. He asked if they'd get to do any procedures on their own, but Bailey said they would not. ''(\"[[Love/Addiction]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n\nMegan told Steve that Henry, presumably another intern, was observing in [[Tricia Hale|Tricia Hale's]] surgery when Mark Sloan announced to the whole OR that [[Izzie Stevens]] and [[George O'Malley]] had broken up. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the navigational computer broke while [[Mary Daltrey]] was having surgery, Derek sent Steve to go to the desk and ask anyone if they knew anything about computers. Nobody came, so Steve went back. Steve later held the probe steady while Derek helped Rose fix the computer. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Cristina was stabbed by an icicle, Steve and [[Dani Mandvi|Dani]] treated her, though she berated them because they didn't know how to read the x-ray. ''(\"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me, Part ]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nSteve was given an epidural so they could practice that. They forgot to put in a catheter when they did it, so he peed himself. They suggested they could take out his appendix as practice, but he refused. He was then confined to a bed until it wore off. Steve was later put on probation with all the other interns. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n\nWhile waiting outside an on-call room trying to get some sleep, Dani, Steve, and Ryan heard a loud, painful moan when Mark broke his penis. Later, while they watched his surgery, they gossiped about who might have broken it. Sadie eventually confessed, despite it actually being Lexie. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Warren Kramer]] came into the ER with an object lodged in his rectum, Steve, Pierce, and Ryan all laughed over his predicament. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. Steve, Ryan, and Lexie reached the finish line at the same time, but Lexie gave the correct diagnosis, so she was declared the winner. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[David Young]] came into the hospital for his face transplant, the interns were prepared for his surgery and were told they'd likely never see another one again. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n\nHe attended Alex and Izzie's wedding. ''(\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes]]\")''\n\n\nWhen George died, Steve attended the funeral. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program. He survived the first round of layoffs. He told Lexie Grey that while he was safe, [[Megan Nowland]] was cut. Megan was pregnant with his child.\ua''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Thatcher Grey]] came in in need of a liver, Steve drew some of Lexie's blood to see if she was a match. ''(\"[[Tainted Obligation]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Derek was looking for someone who was a natural at microsurgery, Steve gave it a shot, but failed. ''(\"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\")''\n\n\nSteve participated in the documentary someone was making about doctors from the hospital. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n\nSteve attended a party thrown by Derek at [[Meredith's House]]. ''(\"[[Shiny Happy People]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the hospital shooting, Steve was among the doctors locked down in peds. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Owen Hunt]] got funding to do a special trauma certification for the residents, Steve assisted him, helping him set up and handing out cards with symptoms. ''(\"[[That's Me Trying]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Megan Nowland]]\nDuring [[Pierce Halley|Pierce]] and [[Megan Nowland|Megan's]] break, Megan slept with Steve and Steve accidentally sent an email to people about their hookup, including Pierce. According to [[Ryan Spalding|Ryan]], Pierce wants to kill Steve, and Steve loves Megan, but it appears that Steve has punched Pierce, with Pierce having a black eye and Steve having a bloody hand. ''(\"[[Stand By Me]]\")''\n\nSteve was married to Megan, by his uncle, at the back of the hospital, with [[Graciella Guzman]] as a witness. But however, he found out that Megan actually did a paternity test, without his knowledge. While Megan opened the envelope containing the results, he got into a fight with Pierce. Despite finding out that Megan's baby was actually his, he divorced her. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\nGirlfriend\nLater, Steve mentioned a new girlfriend while operating. ''(\"[[All You Need is Love]]\")''\n\n\nSteve got on with all interns and used to get on with [[Pierce Halley|Pierce]] before his break-up with [[Megan Nowland|Megan]]. When [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] was stabbed with an icicle he (and the other interns) took pictures on his phone. He is one of the many who loves [[Joe]] and [[Emerald City Bar]].\n\nAt Halloween, Dr. Yang informed the interns that they were to dress up for Halloween, so Steve bought a clown costume. He expected Cristina to be impressed but when she wasn't, he came to the conclusion that she had a fear of clowns.\n\n\nSteve was one of [[Cristina Yang|Cristina Yang's]] [[Internship|interns]]. When Cristina was stabbed, he could not read the [[Medical Glossary#X|X-ray]] as he said she always read them.\n\nSteve was part of the intern group that [[In the Midnight Hour|operated on themselves]], however, Steve specifically was not present during the surgery, as he had been given an epidural a few hours prior and was unable to walk, and had also wet himself. He is an aspiring neurosurgeon. His favorite surgery that he scrubbed in on was a craniotomy with [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]] when he held a probe inside someone\us brain.\n\nSteve is one of the better interns, in Izzie's ''intern bowl'', he tied for second with [[Ryan Spalding]] and just lost to [[Lexie Grey]].\n\nSteve became a second year [[Resident|resident]] and survived the first round of layoffs when [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] merged with [[Mercy West Medical Center]].\n\n\n*Steve had an [http://blogs.abc.com/internsteve/about.html official blog], which has since been removed.\n*He doesn't like dead people.<ref>[[Invasion]], x</ref>\n*His favorite color is light blue.\n*He dressed as a clown for Halloween.<ref>[[Haunt You Every Day]], x</ref>\n*His talents include board games, suturing fruit, Guitar and Mini-Golf\n*His nd favorite Seattle location is Pike Place Market (a.k.a.

After a year, she reapplied to medical school and got in. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nIn her first year, Sydney was responsible for the death of a young patient. He came in with a fever, nausea, and stomach pain. She diagnosed gastroenteritis and sent him home. He came back a few days later with a ruptured appendix and died in surgery. She had a breakdown, so she was given time off, and when she returned, she put a smile on her face and made everyone believe that she was all right. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")'' ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\nAs an intern, she was labelled \"[[]]\", much like George. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nWhen [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] was on maternity leave, Sydney took over overseeing her residents. She clashed with [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]], who found Sydney's positive attitude unbearable. Cristina, at one point, even thought she was purposefully killing a patient because Sydney took a risky approach to treat necrotizing fasciitis in [[Claire Solomon|an active young woman]]. However, her approach worked and she believed Claire would be okay after a few sessions in a hyperbaric chamber. Cristina later apologized to Sydney for overstepping. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n\nShe attended the [[Hospital Prom]], where she got sick off spike punch. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nAfter [[Denny Duquette, Jr.|Denny]] died, Sydney was assigned as [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie's]] peer counselor. Izzie was initially reticent, unwilling to open up to Sydney, but once Sydney confessed her own failings, Izzie was able to slightly open up. Sydney was compassionate when Izzie said that it \"scared [her] too much\" to discuss what had happened. ''(\"[[Where the Boys Are]]\")''\n\n\nSydney helped out when the interns were being taught triage skills, pretending to be a patient that Izzie was treating. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\n\nDuring the ferry crash, Sydney tended to patients in the clinic. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\nSeeing that Alex was stressed, she offered him the chance to sit for a minute or get a hug. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nShe spoke to the family members, saying she knew it was frustrating, but asking them to donate blood if they could. She later told Bailey that she heard what Bailey did for Meredith and said she was great competition for Chief Resident. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n\nBecause Bailey was busy with [[Lawrence Jennings]], Sydney was called to oversee the clinic for a day. She wanted to improve patient satisfaction, so she ordered Izzie to do nasal lavage on a patient she thought had a cold. ''(\"[[Desire]]\")''\n\n\nWhen Meredith brought Ellis's ashes to work on Halloween, Sydney told her that in tribal culture, a person trying to cleanse the past cuts off his or her own hair and buries it. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n\nSydney went on a date with Derek at [[Emerald City Bar]]. She got paged during their date and Mark came up and pointed out how poorly the date was going.

''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]]\nAfter introducing herself to [[Derek Shepherd]], they went out on a date. After the date, however, Sydney informed Derek that he wasn't ready for the kind of relationship she needed (much to Derek's relief, as he was going to let her down gently anyway), but they agreed not to let their relationship affect their work life. ''(\"[[Forever Young]]\")''\n\n\nShe has a friend named Karen who works at a restaurant in downtown Seattle. ''(\"[[The Grey's Anatomy Guide to Healing with Love]]\")''\n\n\nShe served as [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie's]] peer counselor and revealed that her perky persona actually originated from a nervous breakdown she suffered after losing a patient of her own.\n\n\nDr. Sydney Heron is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].

However, when Meredith asked if it was true, he replied \"Whatever helps you sleep at night.\"\n\nWhen his grandfather died, he told Dunn he smelled lemons, but Dunn never knew if it was true because his grandfather was a liar.\n\n\nWilliam Dunn was detained in a high-security prison after murdering five women. He was admitted to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] a week before his execution after being stabbed in the spine with a toothbrush that was sharpened (also known as a shiv).\n\n[[Owen Hunt]], [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Cristina Yang]] (whom he described as \"a bitch\"), and [[Meredith Grey]] were the only doctors assigned to the case and he was placed in the VIP lounge to segregate him from other patients as much as possible. When they found that the shank was still in his spine, he asked if they could just leave him paralyzed, because his lawyer might be able to get a stay of execution if he's paralyzed. Derek refused. An MRI revealed that he also had brain contusions. Meredith asked if she could give him more morphine for his pain and despite Derek saying no, she gave it to him. They then took him into surgery, where they removed the shank and also his kidney. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\nHis brain contusions started expanding, so he needed to be taken into surgery or he could die, which he felt was ridiculous because he was being executed in five days. He refused the surgery because he'd rather die at the hospital than at the prison. Derek told Meredith and Cristina to wait until he passed out and then rush him into surgery. While out in the hallway to get tests, he met up with [[Jackson Prescott]], who asked him what he did wrong. William lied and said it was a traffic violation and then offered his organs when Jackson said he needed a new liver and intestine. He later spoke to Meredith about her allowing him to die. Right before he went unconscious, he begged Meredith just to let him die, so she refused to be the second physician's signature to authorize his surgery. When he woke up after his surgery, he asked why Derek just didn't let him die. Derek told him that he didn't get a choice of how to die, just like the women he killed. Later that night, Meredith, knowing that he was a match for Jackson Prescott and that Jackson had had a failed transplant, went to him and told him that they'd taken his skull cap off, leaving his brain vulnerable. Once Meredith left the room, he started to bash his head into the top of his hospital bed. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\")''\n[[File:WilliamDunnDying.jpg|thumb|left|px|William attempts to die.]]\nWilliam started seizing and Meredith paged Bailey instead of Derek. She told Bailey that William was a match for Jackson. Bailey told her to keep her patient alive, because they're doctors, not executioners. When his condition started to worsen and he had trouble breathing, Meredith reminded him he could stop at any time and she'd page Derek. Cristina eventually came in to examine him and he begged her to help him, saying he didn't want to die. She paged Derek and William was rushed to surgery.\n\nHis surgery was interrupted by [[Miranda Bailey]] who, after hearing that Dunn's organs were a match for Jackson, asked Derek to put down the scalpel and let Dunn die. Shepherd allowed her to choose if he lived or died. Realizing the nature of what she was asking, she couldn't let him die, and told Derek to continue and swiftly left.\n[[File:Dunn'sexecution.jpg|thumb|left|px|Dunn's execution.]]\nAfter the surgery, William told Meredith he had been playing her the whole time. She said he was scared because death is scary. He then asked if she could attend his execution so he could at least see one friendly face in the crowd.\n\n\nMeredith attended William's execution at [[Caldwell Correctional Facility]].
