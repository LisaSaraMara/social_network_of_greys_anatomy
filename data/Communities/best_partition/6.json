She approached Jo Wilson and said they were in the hospital the other night. Jo remember them and asked if Parker was still sick. Casey informed Jo that Parker's fever went down at first, but it spiked again later and she showed her the rash on his belly. Jo asked if Casey gave her son\uathe meds and lots of fluids. Casey said she did, but that his fever was still above , which it had been for over a week. Jo tried to assure her that it was a virus and that it was normal for the fever to last more than  days. Casey then pulled out a bunch of papers, saying she did some online research. Jo rapidly looked at them, but didn't seem convinced. Casey told her she knew her son and that she was sure it wasn't a virus. Jo then agreed to give them a chart.\n\nMeanwhile, Casey accosted Meredith, giving her some names of illnesses she found on the Internet. Jo then came over and told them it was strep, giving them a prescription for omoxacillin. Casey was relieved it wasn't a virus and left with Parker.\n\n\nHowever, some time later, Casey returned to the ER with her son. She told a nurse the fever was getting higher, which didn't make any sense. When Jo came to talk to her, Casey said it wasn't strep and that whatever Jo prescribed wasn't helping. Jo tried to calm her down, saying the meds would take  hours to work, but Casey said that he wouldn't have gotten worse if they did. Casey said Jo was dismissing them, just like the doctors at\ua[[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]]\uaand Urgent Care. Jo looked startled and asked her if she really had been to all those hospitals. Casey said she did, but that she wanted another doctor because Jo either didn't believe her or she didn't care about her son, Parker.\n\nAfter that, Jo got a psychiatrist to talk to Casey. She started screaming at Jo about her thinking she was crazy. She desperately told them that her son didn't do anything anymore, when Meredith overheard her talking. She came over and told Casey she believed her. She told Jo to admit Parker.\n\nIn his room, Meredith said his [[Computed Tomography|CT]] was completely normal. Meredith then patiently overheard all of Casey's research, but none of them seemed to be the one. Meredith said she couldn't come up with anything other than strep, but Casey replied he should've gotten better if it was. Meredith said she'd do some more tests.\n\n\nThe morning after, Meredith told Casey she couldn't find anything else than the strep, that he wasn't surgical, and that his labs kept coming back clean. Casey insisted she had a feeling that something was seriously wrong with her son.\n\nRight before discharging Parker, Meredith and Jo went through Parker's labs one last time. Suddenly, the labs were updated. The previous day's strep test was a false positive. Meredith then realized Parker had Kawasaki disease. She checked her calendar to look if ten days had passed since the fever started. It turned out to be the tenth day. Meredith then ran over to Parker's room to check if he had red eyes.\n\nAfter she found out he did, she told Jo to page peds and cardio and to start IVIG. She told Casey that Parker had Kawasaki disease and it was the last day they would be able to prevent permanent heart damage.\n\nIn the evening, Meredith showed Casey her son's echo. She informed her that the IVIG would fix the fluid around his heart. She added that Parker would need another echo in six months and after showing Casey's note on Kawasaki disease, she smilingly told Casey that she had fought for her son and saved his life. Meredith later walked by their room, where Parker showed his mother a drawing with crayons he made for her.\n\n\n\nDuring her short conversation with the psychiatrist, Casey said she didn't have a husband or a boyfriend and that she was raising Parker all by herself.\ua\n\n\nParker Hedges\nCasey was highly concerned about her son, Parker's, illness.

Later, she joined him at the bar and offered him a pen. He informed her that the pen was advertising an erectile dysfunction drug, explaining why none of the men wanted to take them. She hadn't known because she was an artist who only took the job for money. He invited her for a drink and took the rest of her pens from her so she'd agree. They ended up getting married and having two children.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> He was in the middle of his residency when his boys were babies so he missed out on a big part of their childhood.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Abigail was , she developed fibroids in her uterus. She went in for a minimally-invasive hysterectomy, but it turned out one of the fibroids was actually a cancerous tumor and the machine used to make the hysterectomy minimally-invasive spread the cancer around her body. She underwent treatment, including two clinical trials, but they were unsuccessful. When she reached the point where she knew she was going to die, she talked to Cormac about her wishes for their children and told him it was okay for him to fall in love again. Shortly afterward, she died.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\nCormac then uprooted his whole life and moved to Switzerland, the farthest place he could think of. He got a job at the [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] in Zurich, where he worked with [[Cristina Yang]]. After nearly two years there, he ended up moving back to the United States with Cristina playing a role in the fact that he ended up applying for a job at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n\nCormac was hired without much fanfare since the other attendings were not aware of his hiring. He went to round on his first patient, [[Jamie Caldwell]], and found that [[Meredith Grey]] and [[Andrew DeLuca]] had already started. He asked that they wait for him in the future before rounding on his patients. He butted heads with Meredith when he insisted on examining the patient himself and came to the same conclusion Meredith had. They ordered a CT. While waiting for the results, they continued to butt heads as he commented on her using residents for personal errands and then recognized her name as the surgeon who got herself fired. The CT then showed a mass in Jamie's back between two ribs. Meredith believed it was a gallstone that had escaped during a previous surgery, but Cormac thought it might be a malignant mass. Meredith didn't want to mention a possible malignancy to Jamie and her mother, but Cormac insisted on telling them and went behind her back. Jamie and her mother were extremely worried so Meredith stepped in to ease their concerns. They did a biopsy, which showed that the mass was not malignant. Meredith decided to remove the mass to see what it was. Cormac tried to object, but Meredith said it was her house and he was just a guest. The mass turned out to be exactly what Meredith predicted, impressing Cormac. Meredith later witnessed how he comforted Jamie, who feared her crush was ignoring her, that he could tell from his experience of having two teenage boys that the lack of a reply was just a teenage boy being scared of talking to a girl he liked. Later, Cormac ended up in an elevator with Meredith, who asked if unnecessarily scaring patients and their family and then basking in their relief afterward was his thing. He told her that unlike his late wife's doctors, he preferred to give people all the available information. He then told her that while he understood it was her house, someone had given him a key, so they needed to learn to live together. After he left, Meredith got a text from Cristina\uasaying that Cormac was the package she had sent.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nCormac met [[Jo Wilson|Jo Karev]] when she brought in the -day-old baby boy who had been surrendered at Station . As he examined the boy, Cormac inquired if the hospital had a baby hatch like his hospital in Switzerland. Jo then realized Cormac was the guy Meredith had came to vent about, though she masked it as having heard about the \"new guy.\" Cormac then told her he had heard good things about her husband, his predecessor. When he was done examining the baby, Cormac said they could bring in social services. He then noticed Jo had grown fond of the baby and said they could wait a few minutes. Jo asked if Cormac had kids. He told her about his two teenagers. Cormac held the baby and told Jo he had missed the perfect stage of his boys growing up because of residency. Cormac joked he would have stolen this perfect baby, unaware that Jo had taken the baby home for several hours before bringing him to the hospital. He told Jo of his own sons, saying he believed he missed their best stage because he was a resident when his sons were babies. Later, he had a brief friendly chat with Meredith about them having been called in early.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nA few days later, Cormac entered the attendings' lounge as Meredith was trying to get more information on him from Cristina, who refused to budge. Cormac then introduced himself to a pregnant [[Amelia Shepherd]] and tied her shoe for her as she struggled to do so. He then poured himself some coffee, which he commented was very good. He offered Meredith a cup but she declined. Amelia, in awe of his looks and good manners, informed him that it was better from the cart outside. On their way to the ER, Meredith finally addressed the elephant in the room and brought up Cristina but Cormac was confused as to who she was talking about. Their shared patient, Kai Hale, started throwing up blood. As they waited for the CT results, Cormac told Meredith about his boys and their teenage stupidity. He then apologized to Meredith for their tense first encounter and explained he got a little dark that time of year because it's when he had lost his wife to cancer two years prior. Meredith agreed to start over. She revealed her own spouse had died. She knew the two-year anniversary was a tough one and assured him it gets better over time. Based on Kai's CT, Cormac heavily suspected that their patient had been vaping, which his friends confirmed. He showed them a comparison of Kai's lungs versus healthy lungs to scare them into stopping vaping. Cormac wanted to remove part of his lung to stop the bleeding but Meredith suggested they use coiling instead. Cormac agreed to her approach and watched her every move. He revealed he had seen cases like this before, in which there was often a re-bleed. Moments later, the re-bleed happened so they converted to an open procedure. During the procedure, he said that last time, he was on the opposite side of the debate and the other doctor was Dr. Yang. Cormac informed Kai's father on his tough recovery. He then told Meredith he wouldn't rub it in that he was right, unlike Cristina, who teased him about it for months. Meredith then let it slip that she knew Cristina, though walked off when Cormac asked her about it.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref>\n\nCormac brought his sons to the hospital on a day when there was no school due to parent-teacher conferences. During this time he introduced them to Meredith. They were reluctant to be shown around and when the time came for them to go to their conference, he had trouble finding them and asked Meredith if she had seen them. He contemplated whether he hated his sons from time to time. He said he didn't know how she stayed sane while combining her job with raising her kids. She said she dropped a ball from time to time, like the time her daughter had to tell her the water had been turned off because she had forgotten to pay the water bill.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nWhen [[Joey Phillips]] resisted doing his physical therapy, Cormac challenged [[Levi Schmitt]] to find a way to make it feel less daunting. Cormac himself came up with the idea of letting him play video games. He asked Nurse Karen to find the video game cart and Meredith commented on his idea and informed him she was putting together a pro bono surgery day. As she began to inform Cormac about the video game room, Andrew interrupted her to ask her about a previous case of hers. Cormac pointed out he was being rude. In Italian, Andrew told him to give them a minute. Surprisingly, Cormac told him in Italian to learn some respect. Cormac told Meredith to put him down for her pro bono day and took off to track down the game room. Still, Joey refused to play video games while he had no idea if his foster siblings were okay. Cormac tracked down [[Miranda Bailey]], who had been worrying about Joey's future, and asked if she knew someone they could call to find out about his siblings. She managed to find his siblings and together with Cormac, she escorted them to Joey's room. Joey agreed to play the video games with his siblings. Afterward, Cormac overheard Andrew yelling at Meredith for being a hypocrite for scolding him for not following the rules. Cormac told him to calm down but Andrew yelled back to mind his own business. Meredith told Cormac they were fine and then pointed out that Andrew was sounding like his father. Andrew then told her they were done. Cormac suggested Meredith write him up for his outburst but she brushed it off.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n\n\nDuring a blizzard, Cormac became enraged when a liver became available for his patient, [[Elisa Tang]], but couldn't be transported to the hospital due to the weather. He was grateful when Andrew offered to go on foot to retrieve the liver. While Andrew was gone, Cormac continued to monitor Elisa. When she started hemorrhaging, he and Meredith took Elisa into surgery to place a shunt to stop her bleeding. While they were in surgery, Cormac took the time to get to know Meredith and the two of them bonded over being widowed. When the liver arrived, they transplanted it into Elisa, who immediately started to improve. After her surgery was done, Cormac and Meredith told her parents she'd be okay. That evening, as he left the hospital, Cormac ran into Meredith and told her it was nice to talk to someone who understood what it was like to lose a spouse so young and that it helped to have a friend. Meredith said that it helped her too.\uaHe then confessed that Cristina did talk about having a twisted sister and asked Meredith if that was her. Meredith shrugged and smiled knowingly in response.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\n\nCormac offered his services during the pro bono surgery day Meredith had planned. He made a joke about pro bono surgery day being every day in Ireland, which Meredith didn't appreciate. At the end of the day, Cormac came to see her and brought her tea. He congratulated her for pulling off the pro bono surgery day, but she was not as impressed with herself. In response he said he could now see the twistedness in her that Cristina Yang had talked about. She told him it took him long enough and thanked him for his help.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]] x</ref>\n\n\nCormac went to the Surgical Innovation Conference in Los Angeles upon Bailey's request. He was uncomfortable at the conference, as it reminded him of the time when he first met this wife Abigail at the same conference at the same hotel many years prior.\uaWhen sales rep\ua[[Dane Pinetti]] tried to pitch Cormac and [[Teddy Altman]] on the possibility of his company partnering with Grey Sloan, Cormac revealed that he already knew how one of their most popular devices, the C- power morcellator, worked because\uait had killed his wife by spreading an isolated cancerous tumor throughout her body. Cormac revealed the company knows that it's a problem but\uais paying to suppress the proof that it kills people. He refused to hear anything more from Dane, told him in no uncertain terms to leave, and passed on the drink.\uaDane left\uaand Cormac apologized\uato Teddy for his outburst.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref>\n\n\nCormac worked on the case of [[Daya Burman]], who was at the hospital for a bilateral gracilis transfer to treat Moebius syndrome. During the surgery, he was surprised to find that other people at the hospital had knowledge of his dating life when Jo asked him if he used any dating apps. He told her he didn\ut and she replied that he didn\ut need to seeing as he has his own personal matchmaker referring to Cristina. He asked her what that was supposed to mean and in response she changed the subject.\uaAfter the surgery, he told Jo he hated set-ups and tried to ask her more about it, but she refused to give him a straight answer. He then decided to ask Meredith to get a drink. She accepted, but said she was too exhausted to do it then and told him to ask her again another time. He told her he would and bid her goodnight.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nAfter the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle, Cormac worked alongside the other doctors and nurses at Grey Sloan to treat patients. His sister-in-law, [[Irene Davis]], insisted on moving to Seattle to take care of his boys at home so he could focus on his work at the hospital.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref> One day, he paged Meredith to assist him in operating on [[Frankie Morris]], who had had a kidney transplant two months prior. Frankie was readmitted because his abdomen was impaled by a tree branch. At the end of his shift, Cormac texted Meredith and invited her for a drink, saying that he had another bottle of whiskey in his office. Unfortunately, Meredith didn't see the text because she was asleep at the time. Having not received a response, Cormac headed home for the night only to discover Meredith passed out in the parking lot on the way to her car. Cormac tried to rouse her and when that was unsuccessful, he called for other staff members to help him.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref>\n\nAfter [[Val Ashton]] was admitted and discovered to have an abdominal pregnancy Cormac worked with [[Carina DeLuca]] on baby [[Luna Ashton]], who was born prematurely. Because the baby wasn't moving, Cormac and Carina intubated Luna, transferred her to an incubator, and then transported her to the NICU. Following the procedure, Cormac came to visit Meredith. He had previously asked [[Maggie Pierce]] about her condition and had heard that she was looking for a new Power of Attorney (POA). Due to the new COVID- protocols, Cormac had to video call her from outside her window in full personal protective equipment. He joked that she looked like crap and told her about the Luna Ashton case. They discussed her search for a new POA and Meredith admitted she was having a hard time choosing someone because everyone around the hospital was family. Cormac advised her to write down what she wanted and then choose someone who would choose her over and over again and would defend her choices. She asked if that was what Cormac did for his wife. He told her no and that he knew better than that and that his wife's sister was her POA. Cormac then told Meredith to get some sleep and in response, Meredith confided in him that she was afraid that if she fell asleep she might not wake up. Cormac then gave her a pep talk by telling her that everyone was scared of her because of how fierce she is and because she's got grit and fights to the death about the stupidest little things and that the virus had nothing on her. Meredith then ended the call and went to sleep.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the firefighters from Station  brought in two kidnapping victims who were injured in a house fire, Cormac worked with Levi and [[Jackson Avery]] to treat the two girls, [[Shanice]] and [[Jada Williams]], for smoke inhalation and, in Jada's case, second-degree burns on her left hand. Whilst Cormac was checking up on Jada, her mother [[Joyce Williams]], who had been arrested at the scene, showed up and was reunited with her daughter. Outside the room, Cormac asked Jackson if that was his doing. Jackson had had his attorney look into the case and subsequently used his own money to get Joyce out of jail.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], x</ref>\n\nA few weeks after their hospitalization, both Val and Luna's condition worsened. Cormac diagnosed Luna with a bronchogenic cyst, which required surgery. He informed Jo so she could inform Val but Jo was reluctant to do so because of Val's worsening condition and low spirits. Cormac joined Jo to explain the situation. Val asked to see her daughter before her own surgery. Jo agreed to her request despite Cormac's objections. He said it was against protocol and posed an unnecessary risk for Luna. His opinion caused tension with Jo, who wondered if he was nicer before his wife died. Cormac reminded her that Meredith was laughing and joking a few hours before being put on a ventilator and that the rules exist to keep people safe. Jo then wondered if he would stick to the rules if it were Meredith who wanted to see her kids. Cormac then budged and agreed to a few minutes. However, Val coded as they were moving Luna. While Jo ran the code on Val, Cormac took Luna into surgery. Once back in the NICU with Luna, Jo informed him that Val had died. Cormac then admitted that he was indeed nicer before his wife died and that he was better in a lot of ways. He acknowledged that what Jo wanted to do was kind.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], x</ref> Cormac continued to treat Luna in the NICU over the following weeks and both Jo and Bailey came to visit her frequently.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\nAfter the unexpected death of Andrew DeLuca, Cormac volunteered to help treat COVID patients since they were short-staffed. He helped Teddy out with Meredith's case. He sat by her bedside and told her to pull through as the hospital couldn't take another loss. Since her recent COVID test had come back negative and her status was improving, they decided to try weaning her off the ventilator. He offered to handle it with the respiratory therapist so Teddy could take  a break, but she declined. They lightened Meredith's sedation and lowered the ventilator settings but it soon became clear that it was too soon. They turned the settings back up and agreed to try again in a few days. Cormac helped set up a video call with Amelia and [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]]. He then informed [[Richard Webber]] that weaning Meredith off the vent hadn't worked as hoped. He commented that when his wife died his therapist told him that there was no wrong way to process the loss, but now he knew that doing it over a computer screen was in fact a wrong way. He later went back into Meredith's room and talked to her about her kids in an attempt to encourage her to fight. He described their daily video calls in vivid detail. Having heard stories of previous fights she had won, he believed Meredith had it in her to get better like other patients. In the evening, he set up a tablet in Meredith's room to watch the memorial for Andrew by her side, even though she was still unconscious.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], x</ref>\n\n\nOne day, Cormac received a call from his boys that their aunt Irene had been taken to the hospital by an ambulance. Upset that Irene hadn't informed him herself, he rushed to the ER and found Jo taking Irene's history. Cormac kept interrupting her to stress that Irene was living with multiple sclerosis and used strong teas from her acupuncturist as pain relief, since she had came to distrust Western medicine after her sister's death. As Jo suspected, a CT confirmed that her pain was caused by a kidney stone. Deeply appreciative of Irene despite their differences and not wanting to risk losing another family member, he insisted on the getting the best for her and paged [[Catherine Fox]] when it was determined that Irene would need surgery. Catherine came to see Irene and explained the lithotripsy procedure and the routine nature of it. Cormac took Irene up to the OR himself and tried giving her a little tour on the way, though he admitted there wasn't much to see in a pandemic. Irene was more interested in meeting this general surgeon that made him smile whom her nephews had told her about. Cormac admitted she was on a vent in the ICU. Irene was disappointed she wouldn't get to meet her and that he had fallen for another sick woman. He promised to check in after the procedure, but Jo came out halfway through to inform him that the ureter had detached from the kidney as they pulled out the scope. Cormac began to spiral, saying his boys couldn't lose the one person who had become everything to them in this pandemic. Jo pointed out it was just a complication so he told her to go back and fix it. The repair was successful. As promised, Cormac checked in on Irene with Jo. Cormac thanked Jo. Once she was gone, Irene wondered if Jo was single. Cormac didn't know. Together, they checked in on the boys.<ref>[[Breathe]], x</ref>\n\n\nCormac worked on the case of [[Arthur Beaton]], a toddler with multiple cardiac problems who was awaiting a transplant. After a heart-to-heart with Arthur's distraught father, Cormac went to Maggie and suggested a double-pump EXCOR to stabilize Arthur, but Maggie shut the idea down as Arthur's chest cavity was too small. Cormac felt that Maggie was giving up too easily and challenged her to find a solution, but Maggie pointed out it was time for a difficult conversation with Arthur's parents about taking him off life support. Before doing so, Cormac went to see Luna in the NICU. Jo showed up as well and as they watched the baby girl, Jo said she hoped Luna wouldn't grow up to resent the hand she had been dealt. Jo opened up and shared that she had spent too much time being angry about the way she had come into the world. That was until she let go of that anger, which felt like breaking off the black, crusty pieces of her heart. Her comment inspired Cormac, who paged Maggie to tell her they could remove Arthur's ventricles to make room in his chest for the EXCOR artificial heart. Arthur's father was reluctant but consented after Cormac explained they had no other options but give up. The surgery was a success and Arthur was stable in the PICU afterward.<ref>[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]], x</ref>\n\n\nFollowing the murder of George Floyd on May ,  a Black Lives Matter Protest was organized in Seattle. Cormac attended with his sons, who made protest signs. While at the protest, he sustained a head injury when he interfered when a neo-nazi counter-protester went after one of his sons with a billy club. Cormac then drove himself and the boys to the hospital. They ran into Jackson in the parking lot and asked him for help. While Cormac had his head stitched up, he called Irene to have her pick up the boys. He informed Jackson he wouldn't allow his boys to protest anymore until they were . He decided to stay at work since the ER was filling up with other casualties from the protests. He assisted Richard and Jackson with their initial work-up of [[Nell Timms]], who was shot with a teargas canister at close range at the protest. Later, he ran into Jo in the ER who fixed his band-aid for him. When he started coughing as they were talking, he assured her it was due to the teargas at the protest. He brought up that his boys complained about having to go home rather than back to the protest. Jo understood both sides but Cormac said he had lost too many people to see any side but his own. In the evening, Cormac joined Jackson and Richard as they checked up on Nell, who recounted protest stories from years past. Having gained a better understanding of their importance, Cormac drove home to admit to his boys that he was wrong to forbid them from protesting. He acknowledged they were experiencing an important moment so he had decided they would be allowed to go to protests but only during daylight and with him by their side. They agreed to go to another protest the next day, after which they played soccer together.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n\n\nSome time later, Cormac discharged Nurse [[Jennilynn Mandap]] to great fanfare. She was the hospital's tenth COVID discharge that week and many people's favorite ICU Nurse. When [[Winston Ndugu]] had the idea to sneak Zola into Meredith's hospital room in the hope that it would encourage her to wake up, Richard asked Cormac for child-sized PPE that they could use. Cormac obliged, not knowing it was for Zola until Maggie brought her to the hospital. Richard thanked him and told him that he wouldn't tell anyone that he helped. Cormac told him it was fine with him if he did.<ref>[[Good as Hell]], x</ref> Winston's idea worked and Meredith woke up and started improving which resulted in her being cleared for discharge some time later. Cormac gathered with the other doctors and hospital workers to clap her out in the ambulance bay. However, Meredith did not appear as planned and resident [[Zander Perez]] informed everyone that she was not in her room and that her stuff was gone. Cormac laughed loudly and commended Meredith for pulling one over on everyone. He then wished everyone a good evening and went back inside.<ref>[[Tradition]], x</ref>\n\nA few weeks later Luna\us condition worsened, and she began spitting up after every meal because she lacked a gag reflex from having been intubated for so long. During this time, Cormac met [[Carmen Delgado]] from Child Services who had been assigned as Luna\us legal guardian. Carmen asked that Cormac keep her updated on Luna\us case. The following week Luna\us condition improved somewhat, but she was still suffering from mild reflux. Over time Jo became increasingly attached to Luna and was offended that Carmen barely had any time for Luna. Cormac pointed out that Carmen was a social worker and not her parent. Two weeks later Luna coded, and Cormac had to intubate her. He asked Jo to help him, but she panicked and was unable to do so. After he got Luna\us rhythm normalized Jo told him she wanted to be Luna\us mom. A week later, Luna\us x-rays showed she had aspiration pneumonia which Cormac treated using antibiotics. During this time Jo sat with Luna often and stayed with her throughout the night. In recognition of this Cormac held off on calling Carmen to give Jo more time alone with Luna. He joked that a parent or legal guardian of one of his patients is mad at him at least once a day and that Jo was no different. Jo told him she hoped that Luna would live long enough for her paperwork to go through so that she could adopt her. A week later, Luna was still aspirating, and Cormac wanted to perform a Nissen fundoplication to help stop the reflux. Jo was in favour of the procedure, but Carmen disagreed having taken care of children who had had the procedure before. Carmen told Jo she was sorry that her adoption application was denied as it was a nice idea. After Carmen left Jo told Cormac that her application was denied because she failed her background check.<ref>[[I'm Still Standing]], x</ref>\n\nIn August of , Carmen finally approved Luna's surgery and Cormac operated on her. The surgery was successful and he discussed her case with Meredith who had just returned to work as Directory of Residency. They joked about the events of the past few months and he told her he was confident that her name would be back on the OR board soon. Meredith wasn't so sure. The following month, Luna was eating well and Carmen informed Cormac and Jo that she had found a family that was willing to foster Luna in order to adopt her and that the family had requested a timeline. Cormac told her it was too early to tell and Carmen asked him to keep her updated. On Christmas Eve, Cormac met Meredith in the attendings' lounge and saw that she was upset. He told her the holidays were hard for him as it's when he misses Abigail the most. Meredith changed the subject and said she had hoped that patients who had recovered from COVID would be eligible for lung transplants and Cormac agreed it would be great if they were. He then presented Meredith with her Christmas present which was a opened half-empty bottle of whiskey. He told it was short notice and joked about her passing out to avoid having a drink with him. Meredith poured them both drinks and they finally had their drink together. In April of  Cormac finally discharged Luna from the hospital and Jo took her home as she was now her legal guardian. That same day Cormac attended Maggie and Winston's second wedding. As the couple were exchanging their vows he shared a look with Meredith who wound up having to leave after the ceremony with Teddy to perform a lung transplant on their patient. Cormac stayed for Maggie and Winston's reception and danced with the other guests. Following the reception, Cormac joined his colleagues at the hospital to do a clap out for Meredith after she successfully completed her first surgery post-COVID.<ref>[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]], x</ref>\n\n\n\n\nHe is a humorous man and has been shown to be good with kids and teenagers alike. He used to be kinder before his wife's death while he now has a rather rough edge to him. He can be pretty opinionated and stubborn but is willing to listen to reason and is not afraid to admit when he's made a mistake.\n\n\n\n[[Abigail Hayes]]\nHe was married until his wife, [[Abigail Hayes]], died. He says that before she died, the doctors weren't transparent with him, which is why he tells families everything he knows. It is clear he loved Abigail very dearly because he developed a deep hatred for Wilkes and Boon, the company that created a medical device that resulted in her uterine cancer spreading throughout her body and ultimately killing her, to the point he threatened to kill a sales representative from that company when they wanted to partner with Grey Sloan.\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nUpon moving to Seattle\uahe began developing a relationship with Meredith Grey. At first, their relationship was a rocky one as they butted heads over the case of Jamie Caldwell. However, following that, they worked together on the case of Kai Hale during which\uaCormac apologized for his previous behavior and the two became friends. Eventually, Cormac asked Meredith out and she accepted. However, before they could go out on a date, the COVID- pandemic hit Seattle and so they took to having drinks in his office instead, all of which was put on hold when Meredith contracted COVID- and had to be admitted. After she recovered, they celebrated by sharing a bottle of whiskey in the attending's lounge on Christmas Eve.  \n\n\nHe has two sons, Liam and Austin, who are both teenagers. He cares very much about his sons, and they have a close relationship and tease each other often. His father-in-law used to make him watch American football, which he never understood.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref> While some personal disagreements (i.e. regarding Western medicine) exist between them, he maintains a close relationship with his former sister-in-law, [[Irene Davis]]. She insisted on moving to Seattle when the COVID- pandemic hit so she could look after her nephews.\n\n\nHe knows and worked with [[Cristina Yang]]. She is responsible for him coming to work at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He described her as being a nightmare to work with and that when they disagreed about a surgery and she turned out to be right she drove him mad and rubbed it in his face.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref> However, she clearly likes and respects him otherwise she wouldn't have sent him as a gift for Meredith. \n\nSince moving to Seattle, he has worked well with [[Jo Wilson]], even though they can disagree sometimes.\n\n\nHe is the [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Pediatric Surgery]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Before taking the job there, he used to work at the\ua[[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]].\n\n\n*He speaks Italian.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref>\n*He loves soccer.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n*His scrub cap is plain black.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n*He drives a black Audi, and the license plate number is MTCP.<ref>[[Sign O' the Times]], x</ref>\n*He thinks iced coffee is just coffee-flavored water.<ref>[[Hotter Than Hell]], x</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"\" position=\"center\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxCormacHayes.png\nxCormacHayes.png\nxCormacHayes.png\nxCormacHayes.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GalleryLink}}\n\n\nThese episodes are Cormac-centric or are otherwise very informative about his life.\n*[[Love of My Life]]\n*[[Breathe]]\n*[[No Time to Die]]\n*[[Living In a House Divided]]\n\n\n\n\n{{Cormac Hayes Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Cormac Hayes]]\n[[de:Cormac Hayes]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayes, Cormac}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

Jared, Dan said, was a good kid, but he got pulled into trouble which landed him in juvie. Dan and Brett still hoped Jared would have his moment, the moment where he either turned his life around or ended up in jail or dead.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Jared chose to be an accomplice to some friends of his who were robbing a bank at gunpoint. When the police came into the bank, the suspects started shooting. They hit both Brett and his brother, [[Peter Gibson|Pete]], as well as Dan himself. The police brought their own wounded directly to the hospital, with Dan carrying Brett into the hospital and putting him on a gurney. He went between Brett and Pete, checking on how they were doing. When [[Callie Torres]] noticed that he was bleeding, she pulled him into a bay in the ER and tended to his leg. He'd been shot in the leg. His injury did not require surgery, just a splint, but he was told that he'd need to stay off it for at least six weeks, maybe eight. While he was in the hospital, he kept asking about how Brett, Pete, and Jared were doing. When he found out that Jared needed a liver and that Brett was a match for him, he talked to Brett and Pete's mom and asked her to donate Brett's liver to Jared, which she agreed to do. He hoped that once Jared healed, he'd be able to get him on the right path.\n\nAfter Dan's leg was splinted, he was discharged from the hospital. As he was wheeled out of the hospital, Dan told Callie that if it were just a regular day, he'd ask her out on a date. She told him he'd need to come in for a follow-up visit in ten days. ''(\"[[When I Grow Up]]\")''\n\n\nAfter his follow-up, he went on a date with Callie. She said it started well, but then she discovered that he was boring, so she said there would be no second date. ''(\"[[Crazy Love]]\")''\n\n\nDan was injured while chasing a suspect. He had fallen off a building that was under construction. He fractured his spine and both legs, the right worse than the left. Callie was able to identify him in the OR before his surgery.\n\nAfter his surgery, Dan had a temporary abdominal closure, plus he needed more surgeries to fuse his spine. Callie told him she wasn't confident she'd be able to save his leg and either way, there was a long road ahead for him.\n\n\nIn a later surgery, Callie told Amelia she had talked to Dan about being a candidate for her bionic prosthetic, so it would delay his progress if his spinal fusion took longer than planned. His leg ultimately had to be amputated.\n\nAfter his residual limb and other injuries had sufficiently healed, Callie got Dan up and walking on the robotic leg. She told him he had the best first run of any of her patients. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\n\n\nAfter he was released from the hospital, Dan told [[Callie Torres]] that if it were a regular day, he'd asked her out for a date. She simply responded that he needed to come back in ten days for a follow-up visit. ''(\"[[When I Grow Up]]\")''\n\nThey later went on a date, but Callie said Dan was boring, so there would be no second date. ''(\"[[Crazy Love]]\")''\n\nWhen he came back into the hospital after being injured again, Dan flirted with Callie, but she made it clear to him that she was just his doctor. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\n\nDan gets along well with his partner, [[Brett Gibson]] and another cop, [[Peter Gibson]], both of whom were injured in the bank robbery. He carried Brett into the ER himself and was reluctant to leave them in order to get his own wound treated.\n\n\nDuring his time on the force, Dan met Jared, a  year old kid whom he said was susceptible to falling in with bad crowds. He and Brett arrested Jared and put him in juvenile detention in an attempt to try to straighten him out. When Jared was shot during the bank robbery, during which he had been waiting outside in the car, Dan thought it would be the moment, where he could turn his life around. When Jared needed a liver transplant and Brett was a match, Dan spoke to [[Mrs. Gibson]] and asked her to donate Brett's liver so Jared could get his chance.\n\n\nDan is a police officer in [[Seattle]]. He's been on the force for  years and he said that the bank robbery was the first time he'd ever had to fire his weapon, the first time they'd ever been shot at. [[Brett Gibson]] was his partner.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nxDanPruitt.png|[[When I Grow Up]]\nxDanPruitt.png|[[She's Leaving Home]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Dan Pruitt Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pruitt, Dan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Prosthesis)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Police Officers]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She apologized and said she already had plans for that night, and she walked up to Jason, who was waiting for her down the hall. A disappointed Alex asked Stephanie who the guy was, and she told him that they nicknamed him Chest Peckwell and that Jo finally dared to ask him out, something she had wanted to do ever since she first saw him.\ua''(\"[[Hard Bargain]]\")''\n\nThey grew closer and discussed whether or not\ua[[Obstetrics and Gynecology|obstetricians-gynecologist]]\uacould be considered surgeons. Jo mocked him for his pink scrubs, and he gave up. \"You really pull it off though,\" she complimented him, after which she wanted to kiss him, but Alex interrupted by entering the elevator. Jo introduced him to Jason, but Alex only cared about his patient. Alex took the stairs instead of going up with them in the elevator. At the end of the day, Alex interrupted Jo and Jason again at Joe's to apologize to Jo for the way he had been treating her. He asked her if he could buy her a drink, but Jason made it clear that he wanted him to leave.\ua''(\"[[Transplant Wasteland]]\")''\n\n\nOne of Alex's patients was really attached to Jo, and when Jason entered the room to talk to his girlfriend, the kid popped out his IV, causing the fluid to spill on Jason's pants. \"Don't sweat it, little man,\" Jason friendly says, but the kid replied that he's  already, but that his growth got stunted by a lifetime of cancer. Jason awkwardly left with Jo. Behind his back, Alex and the kid made a deal to fool Jason. They paged him to the ER, and he kept on looking for a patient, not knowing that there was no patient.\n[[File:JasonPrankPhotos.png|thumb|px|One of the photos Alex took of Jason looking for his patient.]]\n\nHe went to the ER, to ortho, then back to the ER and even to the cafeteria, and unbeknownst to him, Alex took pictures of him to show to the kid. They later paged him for another patient, now with a name: Talia. The nurse told him that he could treat her if he could find her. \"I'm looking for a miss Talia, Jenny Talia! I'm here to see Jenny Talia\" he yelled, only to be laughed at by everyone in the ER. Jason later gave Bailey his urine sample, as he read on the memo that she was in charge of the random drug test policy. Jason heard Alex and Richard, who joined Alex and the kid, laughing at him. Jason took back the cup and left. In the evening, he approached Alex, saying he really got him with the pranks. Alex says the kid got a little crush on Jo. \"Oh, the kid does. Right, well you two kids have fun laughing about it later while I'm nailing Jo in the bathroom at the bar,\" Jason told him, and he then went to talk to Jo in the kid's room.\ua''(\"[[Idle Hands]]\")''\n\nJo and Jason started to make out in the conference rooms at the hospital every chance they got. Alex interrupted them a first time to tell Jo that she had to check her pager. April had a pregnant patient, whose baby had to be delivered right away. As OB hadn't made it to the ER yet, Alex jumped in and took the patient to the OR. He told a nurse to ask OB to meet them in the OR. Jason was in time to deliver the baby, where Alex mentioned he was slow. Jason told him he was being unprofessional. He later met Alex and Stephanie, who was busy listing some of Jason's qualities to Alex, in the NICU. Jason brought the father of the baby with him, and he allowed the father to hold his newborn daughter. The mother of the baby later died in the ICU, and as April couldn't bring herself to go tell the patient's husband, Alex asked Jason to do it, as the family knew and trusted him. However, Jason refused to do it as Elyse wasn't his patient anymore. They started arguing again, and Jason brought up Jo again. When Jason refused to come with him to tell the father, Alex mentioned he'd be doing his job again.\ua''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\nJason asked her to move in with him, which she accepted. Cristina and Alex had to perform a cardiothoracic surgery on a baby that Jason had to deliver. She proposed to deliver the baby in the cath lab to save time. Both Alex and Jason were against the idea, but when Cristina asked him if he wanted to be the badass that delivered the kid in a cath lab, Jason decided to side with her. They both called him Peckwell, so he tried to get them to call him Jason Myers, but Cristina told him nobody cared about his name. Jason successfully performed the C-section. When Alex informed Jason on the baby's condition, Jason told Alex that he really appreciated his work today and that the thing with Jo got them off on a bad foot. \"She cares a lot about you,\" Jason said, and Alex assured him that they were just friends. Alex then opened up to him and said that he and Jo had a similar past as foster kids, but she had it way worse than him. He says that she was unhoused and lived in her car, and that he now wants the best for her as she managed to turn her life around. Jason was surprised, as Jo hadn't told him about her crappy past. Jason and Jo got into a fight because she hadn't told him.\ua''(\"[[Sleeping Monster]]\")''\n\n\nAs Alex and Jackson left to have a drink at Joe's, they saw Jo and Jason were having a serious fight. Alex kept on walking, as Jo specifically told him to stay out of her life. Back at his apartment, their fight continued until Jason grabbed Jo's arm, which prompted Jo to hit him a few times until he fell back and hit his head and was unconscious. While Jo went to Alex's house, Alex went to Jason's house and took him to the hospital.\ua''(\"[[Do You Believe in Magic]]\")''\n\nAlex brought Jason into the hospital severely beaten. He had a temporal bone fracture and an epidural hemorrhage. He was taken into an OR to evacuate the bleed. In surgery, they discovered that his dura was torn. After surgery, he woke up and appeared to be fine. However, he was asking for the cops. Alex went in and talked to him and pressured him not to press charges against Jo.

She was previously an [[attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] before switching specialties. Following her [[Paul Stadler|estranged husband]]'s death, she married [[Alex Karev]] until he left her for his ex-wife, [[Izzie_Stevens|Izzie]]. She is now the mother of [[Luna Ashton]].  \n\n\n\nAt only five days old, Jo Wilson was left by her [[Vicki Ann Rudin|mother]] at a fire station. She was shuffled among numerous foster homes until age  when she began living independently out of her car. Her teacher, Ms. Schmidt, would let her into the school building early to use the school showers and to do laundry. Jo worked furiously to get through school, graduating as high school valedictorian and moving on to Princeton University, where she graduated cum laude. Wilson then attended [[Harvard Medical School]], where she graduated at the top of her class. Wilson confessed to [[Alex Karev]] that Ms. Schmidt was the only person who supported her and thus the only one at her graduation.\n\n\nDuring a conversation with [[Andrew DeLuca]], Jo revealed that she is married. She said, \"when I bought something wrong, he'd hit me in my face, or my stomach...\" Being done with his abusive behavior, Jo fled to somewhere he'd never find her: Seattle. She claimed that if she tried to divorce him, he would find her. Jo kept her past confidential until after Alex proposed when she drunkenly confesses to Andrew that, that was the reason. She also admitted that 'Jo Wilson' isn't her real name. Her real name was 'Brooke Stadler'.<ref>[[Family Affair]], x</ref>\n\n\nJo started her internship at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] shortly after the [[Flight|plane crash]]. She quickly learned, along with the other interns, to fear [[Meredith Grey]], dubbing her Medusa. Meredith was put in charge of choosing an intern for the intern appy and she chose Jo. As the other interns gathered in the gallery and unknowingly insulted Meredith with the intercom on, Jo started the surgery under Meredith's supervision. Jo successfully took out the appendix but ripped the cecum afterward. As Meredith pressed her to think and act, Jo froze as expected. Meredith had to finish the surgery. After the surgery, Owen found Jo crying in the hallway. He told her to cry elsewhere and informed her that the intern appy is designed for the intern to fail to set an example for the others. Jo then asked him why Meredith was so mean, bringing up the plane crash she had heard about. Owen told her that Meredith wasn't mean but strong and that she was so hard on Jo in order to teach her the way she deserved to be taught.<ref>[[Going, Going, Gone]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she wanted to scrub in on a surgery, she flirted with Callie to try to make it happen. However, Callie pointed out that Jo looked terrified that Callie might take her up on that offer, meaning she probably isn't into ladies. Callie told her not to trade sex for scrubbing in because that's skanky, to save it for actually getting to cut. Then she sent her to go suck up to Alex instead. He said no and when he saw her watching from the gallery, he sent her away. Later, when he scolded her for charting when she hadn't scheduled a consult for him, she began to cry, freaking him out. He invited her to scrub in on a surgery with him.<ref>[[Love the One You're With]], x</ref>\n\nAfter dealing with the case of [[Kimmy|Kimmy's]] son, Jo revealed to Alex what her childhood had been like.<ref>[[Love Turns You Upside Down]], x</ref>\n\nWhen given an opportunity to do something none of the other interns had done yet, Jo jumped at the chance. However, when she froze in the OR, she went to [[Arizona Robbins]] and told her what had happened, saying she believed Alex set her up to fail. Alex later came to her and told her that he was trying to let her do something cool, but she freaked out. She said she was paranoid because her life has taught her that she can't trust anyone, but he informed her that she needs to get over it.<ref>[[Run, Baby, Run]], x</ref>\n\nAt Bailey's wedding, she had a drink, so when the doctors were called back to the hospital after a motorcycle crash, she was unable to go with them. Instead, she continued to drink with Alex. They got drunk and broke into a hotel room, where they raided a mini-bar.<ref>[[Things We Said Today]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she heard about the plan to sell the hospital for parts, she admitted to Alex that she was sad and didn't want not to see him anymore, because she liked that he would talk to kids about pulling tiny little men out of their bellies.<ref>[[This is Why We Fight]], x</ref>\n\n\nJo and the other interns started referring to Jason as \"Chest Peckwell.\" Alex took an immediate distaste to him, even going so far as to gang up with a patient and Dr. Webber to prank him, to which Jason responded with a snide comment about \"nailing Jo in the bathroom.\"<ref>[[Idle Hands]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she told [[Alex Karev]] that she was planning to move in with Jason, he was initially very angry with her. However, after working with Jason on a case, he told Jason that he was just protective of Jo because he had been in a similar situation to Jo as a child, though he never had it quite as bad as she did. He was unaware that Jo had not told Jason any of this. When Jo found out that Jason knew, she became angry with Alex for telling him.<ref>[[Sleeping Monster]], x</ref>\n\nAfter a heated fight which involved Jason hitting Jo, she fled to Alex's house. He settled her into his bed. When Alex showed up at the hospital with Jason, who had been severely beaten, Meredith and Cristina assumed that Alex had done it, but it turned out that Jo herself had done it. When he grabbed her arm, she fought him off and he fell back and hit his head on the fireplace. She claimed he was fine when she left and still yelling.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\nDuring the superstorm, Jo helped to bag the babies in the NICU and then later to teach the parents how to bag their own babies. Arizona told Alex that Jo was great that day and if he's going to take credit for making his ladies crazy, he should take credit for helping make them great. Alex found Jo later and confessed his love. They shared a kiss.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|xpx|Jo and Alex at the gala]]\nAfter their first kiss, Alex and Jo went to an [[On-Call Room|on-call room]] to make out. Alex wanted to wait to do it at his house, but Jo reminded him that there was a tree in his house and removed her scrub top. They continued kissing until Jo asked them if he had sex with Heather and Leah in that particular room. He confirmed, but Jo decided she could move past this and they continued kissing. He got paged, and she asked him to ignore the page. This made her think about dead people so they gave up. They went to the ER to help out treating the storm victims, which was impeded by the fact that they were all low on supplies and that the electric charts were still down. Meanwhile, she and the other interns also waited for news on Heather, who was being operated on. In a supply closet, Jo talked to Alex about her fear that Heather would die, only ending up to start kissing him again. However, it turned out Alex also had had sex with other interns in that closet, so Jo decided it wasn't going to happen there and left.<ref>[[Seal Our Fate]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the mourning interns, who got the night off, decided they would all wait together for [[Maura Brooks|Heather's mother]] to arrive, as none of them wanted to do it on their own. They started looking for kind Heather stories to tell Maura and decided to look for Derek to hear about her talent for neurosurgery, but Meredith told them the mother wouldn't care about that and told them the story that she told George's mother back when he had died. Jo then met Alex in a lounge and told him that she and the others apparently weren't a tight group. They joked a little about the future of their relationship and he gave her a bottle of liquor that would help her and the others to come up with stories. Jo went to her fellow interns in the dressing room, where they started drinking. They realized that they knew nothing about each other, despite all the time they spent together. They decided to play circle of trust, during which Jo revealed to have been a street kid. Not long after, Maura Brooks arrived, and they stole Meredith's story. They then sat with her until Derek arrived to tell her what happened to Heather. Early in the morning, Derek met with the interns in the ER waiting room and thanked them for having stayed with Maura. He told them to go home, but Shane decided to ride out with the firefighters to the mudslide instead. Jo, Stephanie and Leah declared him crazy, but suddenly Stephanie stood up too and gave a speech that made it clear to Leah and Jo that they should stick together. Jo and Leah then got up too, and followed Stephanie and Shane to the ambulance bay to ride out to the mudslide with the firefighters.<ref>[[I Want You With Me]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Heather's death, the interns began all sleeping at Alex's house and studying. Jo was waiting for Alex to proposition her so they could have sex and Alex was waiting because he thought she was still grieving, so he said they could stay there as long as they wanted. Jo went to the others and said that they needed to leave. That night, Jo went to Alex's house to wait for him. He came home and she said she was not an unfeeling person, but she wanted to have sex. He picked her up and carried her upstairs.<ref>[[Everybody's Crying Mercy]], x</ref>\n\n\nAt the fundraising gala, Jo spoke to donors on Alex's behalf, but pressured him to talk to them himself. When Alex left to go back to the hospital, Jo was upset. She went back to the hospital and found him drawing blood from himself. She believed he was doing drugs, but he corrected that he believed his father was in the hospital, so he was drawing blood to check. When the results came in, Alex decided he didn't want to know just before Jo told him that it was his father.<ref>[[Puttin' on the Ritz]], x</ref>\n\nWhen the time came for Alex's father to be discharged, Jo got him set up for  days in a rehab facility. He declined and left the hospital.<ref>[[I Bet It Stung]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex didn't come home for several nights, Jo was concerned that he was seeing someone else, but she figured out that it was about Alex's dad.<ref>[[Map of You]], x</ref>\n\nJimmy later returned in withdrawal. Jo treated him over Alex's objections.<ref>[[Man on the Moon]], x</ref> After speaking to Jimmy and telling him that Jimmy leaving when he was a kid was better for all of them, Alex went to the wedding and told Jo that they were all they needed and that they'd be together forever. She agreed, but didn't realize that he meant it as a marriage proposal.<ref>[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]], x</ref> When Jimmy's wife came to the hospital after Alex lied to her and said that Jimmy was dead, Alex introduced Jo as his fianc\uee, confusing her. She confronted him about it, saying she wasn't leaving him, but she wasn't ready for marriage.<ref>[[Take It Back]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Callie was sued by [[Travis Reed]] for malpractice, which led to the amputation of both of his legs, Jo testified on her behalf as she had scrubbed in on the surgery.<ref>[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]], x</ref>\n\n\nJo was upset to hear about the non-fraternization policy. She said that since they spend so much time at the hospital, they don't have time to meet anyone else. When she found out that one of the residents had filed the claim that led to the policy, she immediately assumed that Stephanie had filed it and was cold toward her. She later went to Stephanie when she found out that April and Jackson were still together. She said that Stephanie filing the claim was ruining her life, but Leah confessed that she filed the claim and explained why she did it.\n\nJo and Alex staged a fake fight and breakup so that people wouldn't think they were together. They started to sneak around the hospital, but after a rendezvous in a supply room, which Richard discovered, they were called into a meeting with the board. Alex came in and called them hypocrites before leaving.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Alex was suspended for violating the policy, Meredith began to look into options for them. She got them a love contract and said if they signed it, HR said it was okay if they continued to date. Alex was worried about Jo leaving him if he asked her to sign the contract.<ref>[[Throwing it All Away]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex presented Jo with the contract, she told him she wouldn't sign it. Alex later assured her that the contract wasn't a commitment and that she wouldn't count on him, but said that he wanted to kiss her whenever he wants to kiss her and the contract would allow him to do that.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a case came in of two sisters, one of whom had developed three kinds of cancer in her lifetime, Richard told the residents to do research on Li-Fraumeni, as that's the condition the girl had. They did the research and developed a treatment plan, but [[Rory Williams]] had already died.<ref>[[You've Got to Hide Your Love Away]], x</ref>\n\nAt Richard's birthday party, Owen asked him to be director of the residency program because he noticed how well he'd been mentoring the residents.<ref>[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]], x</ref>\n\nDerek warned that he wasn't teaching enough, took all the residents to work on a case with him that he had rescheduled several times. As the OR wasn't available until  AM, he then took them to the ER to work on the incoming patients, including having them work on a patient who was already dead so they could work with real brain tissue. When a man came in with scissors puncturing his forehead, they took him into an OR for a controlled extraction. Jo extracted the scissors after Leah was unable to pull hard enough. Then they went back to the case of [[Nova Jenkins]]. Each of the residents took a turn to step up to the microscope and ask a question so they could learn.<ref>[[Go It Alone]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Jo was on scut, she was working on several cases at once. She found that she couldn't handle working on so many cases at once, as it put patients at risk. After a day of that, Jo overheard Owen and Richard talk about one of the residents not being cut out for surgery. Jo believed it was her.<ref>[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen a patient with tetanus had a spasm that snapped his arm, Jo was concerned that she had broken the patient's bone. She worked on the case with Callie. While working on the case, she discovered that she has a knack for ortho.<ref>[[You Be Illin']], x</ref>\n\nJo was used for testing the emotion-reading machine Callie and Derek had gotten for their trial. She didn't have a positive response to the expected stimuli, but when Callie mentioned an ortho injury that came into the ER, Jo lit up.<ref>[[I'm Winning]], x</ref> Jo continued to work with Callie on ortho cases and loved it.<ref>[[Change of Heart]], x</ref> She worked with Callie on an ortho case after hearing that one of the residents was about to be fired. In an attempt not to get fired, she continued to suck up to the attendings. Callie noticed this and said that she needed to have grit if she planned to continue working on ortho.<ref>[[Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right]], x</ref>\n\nYears later, Paul was able to find Jo in Seattle and he confronted her.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], x</ref> While they talked, he explained to her that he and his fiancee, [[Jenny (Season )|Jenny]], wanted to get married but they couldn't since he and Jo were still married. They later signed the divorce papers.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nWhile Paul was distracted by Arizona, Jo was able to find Jenny and warned her of Paul's abusive tendencies. Jenny said that they were happy and denied any abuse, but Jo gave Jenny her card with her cell number on it in case she needed help. While Jo was in the resident's lounge, Paul came to her and said that Jenny told her what Jo had said and gave Paul Jo's card. He told her that he decided to keep it for himself.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Paul became the victim of a hit-and-run, Jenny assumed that it was Jo who did it and thanked her for it. Jo later went with Jenny to confront Paul and vowed to tell the police about how he abused her. This angered Paul and he and tried to attack her, but hit his head and caused second-impact syndrome, causing his brain to swell and leaving him brain dead. Since Jo was still legally his wife, she was tasked with making his end-of-life decisions, which she used to donate his organs.<ref>[[Personal Jesus]], x</ref>\n\n\nThe day after their wedding, Alex and Jo travelled to Los Angeles for their honeymoon. They settled on the beach and Jo brought up an article she had read about killer cancer cells. It felt new to her, while Boston already felt old. As he said he wouldn't mind their kids growing up in Boston, she had a thought and ran off. She went to a beach bar and started writing down ideas on napkins. He came to apologize for talking about kids, but she told him to shut up so she could focus as it was not about the kids thing. She returned to their vacation apartment to work on her idea. When Alex returned from a day of fun around town, she presented him with her idea: introducing suicide genes in cancer cell DNA to design cancer killer cells. She apologized for ruining their honeymoon, but he was just delighted that she agreed to marry him. He fed her some food and commented that their kids would be really smart.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], x</ref>\n\nJo and Alex returned to Seattle early and they presented Meredith with Jo's idea. Meredith hated that she came to wave the future of medicine in her face before leaving for Boston, but Jo said she actually wanted Meredith to create a fellowship for her that would allow her to work on the mini livers and her own projects. Meredith loved the idea and took it to Bailey. Meanwhile, Jo cancelled Boston. However, Meredith came back with bad news: there was no money to fund the fellowship. Jo and Alex then went to Joe's for day drinking. Alex suggested she call Boston back, but she had come to realize she only applied there because she could, but it felt like going backwards. Empowered by the alcohol, Jo and Alex went back to Bailey's office and Jo pitched why she was the future of medicine. Bailey then decided to create the fellowship and fund it with her own money as she was in need of some joy. Afterwards, Jo returned to the bar and bragged to the interns about her new fellowship.<ref>[[Broken Together]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Now going by Dr. Jo Karev, Jo tries to get started on the fellowship.]]\nJo's first day in navy scrubs coincided with Alex's first day as interim Chief. They enjoyed the Chief parking space and headed in. Jo felt like people were staring at them. She gave Alex a gift to celebrate his promotion and went to work. Bailey had trouble letting go of her job while Jo wanted to get to work on the fellowship. Bailey had Jo operate with her and then headed out to take care of stuff. Jo went to complain to Meredith that she'd rather work with her, but Meredith advised her to just tell Bailey what she needed. Jo later found her in the Chief's office, thinking she was going over the research she had sent her, but Bailey actually discovered that Alex had spent the entire quarter's budget in a day. Jo then left them to talk.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], x</ref>\n\nWhile in bed together and making out, Jo asked Alex for a new INUMAC MRI. He felt like she was taking advantage and left for work. She later set the record straight in a hallway, stating she just wanted orgasms from him, which was overheard by Richard. He later found her to go home together and apologized for calling her a hooker. They then came across [[Atticus Lincoln]], whom Jo enthusiastically greeted and who called her Brooke. Alex stood there confused while the two reconciled.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], x</ref>\n\nJo took care of Alex's voting ballot. She and Link caught up on the years they missed of each other's lives. Jo explained to Richard that she and Link went all the way back to undergrad when they waited tables together, adding that they were like brother and sister, so nothing romantic ever happened. Jo then went to her lab and found that Bailey had written whiteboards full of different approaches to Jo's cancer killer cells idea. Since it was too much for one year, they needed to narrow it down. Both were then called in for a consult by Alex for [[Nina Sullivan]], whom had a mysterious cause of abdominal pain. Jo and Bailey managed to figure it out. Later, Bailey confided in Jo that she had removed all stressors at work from her life, but she was still stressed. While Bailey was thinking that Ben was the cause of it all, Jo assured her that the two of them were good together. She then went by Alex's office. She heard he had worked with Link and he told her he was a great guy. They started to make out in his chair.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], x</ref>\n\nJo assisted Alex at work to make him less grumpy all the time. She then got the idea to set up Link with Meredith, assuring Link that she was worth the effort to get her to open up. When a donor liver for their patient was redirected, Jo and Bailey came up with the idea to revive a liver from a deceased patient using a perfusion system. Alex ordered them to shut it down as to not risk their standing with UNOS. She met up with Link, who had been turned down by Meredith. Jo told him she did that to her, too, but she came around. Bailey then paged her, having decided to go behind Alex's back. They pulled off the transplant successfully. While Alex was angry at first, he admitted to getting turned on by Jo's genius and they made out in his office, closing the blinds when [[Frankie Shavelson|Nurse Frankie]] saw them. That night, Jo invited Link to the loft so she could properly cut his hair after he had cut off a piece to comfort a cancer patient. Meredith came over, too, needing some company. As she took over from Jo, Jo and Alex agreed that Meredith and Link did look nice together.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], x</ref>\n\nAlex and Jo overslept on the day of the massive windstorm. By the time they got up, it was too dangerous to go outside, so they decided to stay in and have a second honeymoon. When the electricity died, she wound up finding Bubbe, a Bunsen burner she had used to cook meat on while she was living in her car. She also found their marriage certificate. Since neither had mailed it in, their marriage wasn't official. They later went through all their wedding presents that April had registered for and found they didn't need any of them, so they agreed to return them and buy a bigger TV with the money they'd get back. They made out and drank beer out of fancy glasses. They enjoyed the married life and agreed to mail in the certificate.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], x</ref> As soon as the bridge re-opened, Alex felt pressured as Chief to go to the hospital. She agreed he should go and stayed behind herself.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], x</ref>\n\nJo, Meredith, and Link ended up working on [[Natasha Deon|Natashe Deon's]] case together while Meredith and Link grew more and more frustrated with one another. Jo defended her trying to set them up by explaining to Meredith that Link was the greatest guy she ever met before Alex, like Meredith had been for Alex. She assured her that he was a great guy once you got to know him. During surgery, Meredith questioned how Link could be a doctor despite his laid-back attitude. Jo says his cancer inspired him to become a doctor, but Link shut her down as it was not her story to tell. Natasha had to be put in a medically-induced coma to let her heal while her fianc\ue sat by her side. Jo went to tell Alex she was glad they were alive and that they got married. Later, she came across Amelia and Tom arguing over a way to visualize Catherine's tumor and showed them to a brand-new type of microscope that would help them.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jo finds that Meredith is in a love triangle with Link and Andrew.]]\nWith the holidays approaching, Jo invited Meredith to her and Alex's navy blue scrubs-only NYE party and suggested she bring Link as a plus one. Instead, Meredith invited Andrew. Jo was upset, but Meredith stated she could handle her own love life. Jo then mocked her for being in a love triangle. Over the course of the holidays, the doctors continued to work on Natasha, whose status kept declining to the point where death was imminent. Alex had an idea to give her her wedding under the stars. He and Jo gathered all the doctors and nurses in Natasha's room and they held up their phones with images of stars on the display while Meredith officiated the wedding.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], x</ref>\n\nJo found out that Meredith had stood up Link on Valentine's Day and vented some anger, but Meredith had already apologized to him by then. When a display with all Chiefs of Surgery from the past and present was installed in the cafeteria, Jo made Alex pose with his picture and sent a picture of him to his mother to show her how far he had come. She assisted Maggie and Meredith whilst operating on [[Kimberly Thompson]]. Afterwards, she found that someone had switched Alex's and Bailey's pictures in the cafeteria, so Jo switched them back.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], x</ref>\n\nJo watched Meredith's record-breaking surgery for longest surgery at the hospital for a while until she got paged to the ER when it was flooded with victims of a mass overdose at the park. She took care of a mother who claimed to have lost her playing son in the chaos at the park, but they later found out that she was a junkie herself who had taken her son with her to get a fix. Jo witnessed how Alex pressed the father to protect his son no matter what, even if it meant keeping him away from his mother, and she realized he himself had been through something similar with his father. She brought him hot chocolate in his office to comfort him and he told her about his experience of being left in a parking lot when he was .<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], x</ref>\n\n\nWhen Jo was finishing up things at the hospital before leaving for Catherine's party at Jackson's place, she ran into [[Helen Karev]] at the hospital and found out that Alex supposedly had \"another doctor\" tell her to meet him at the party. Jo then offered her a ride and tried to call Alex, but he didn't answer. She found out Helen had travelled to Seattle through public transportation after getting inspired by the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Alex and Jo watch over Helen at the party.]]\nOnce they arrived, she started googling symptoms of a psychotic break, thinking the other doctor was in Helen's head, and made Jackson fetch Alex. While Jo and Alex discussed the possibility of Helen having a break, she disappeared amongst the other guests. They found her soon and tried to reach her doctor but were unable to get a hold of him due to the time difference. They decided to watch her for the night and find out more in the morning. Jo and the other guests evacuated when a supposed fire broke out. Outside, Jo stood by as Alex introduced his mother to Meredith, after which they took Helen home with them to the loft. They got her settled on the couch and watched her from the bed.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], x</ref>\n\nJo and Alex took Helen to the hospital for a tour and Jo discovered she had knitted baby hats in an array of colors. Alex admitted he had told his mother that they wanted kids. Taken aback, Jo claimed she had a surgery and left. She then got herself on Jackson and Link's rotationplasty. During the surgery, Jo talked about having Helen over and how nice she was as a guest, except that she and Alex were now planning their babies. Jackson then asked her if she did not want kids like Alex. She said she did, but \"some day\" started to sound an awful lot like \"today.\" Jackson talked about Harriet and Jo asked if all the cute stuff outweighs the terror, like always worrying about them and bad things happening to them. Jackson was offended so she apologized to him after surgery. He told her kids can be monsters, but at the same time, they give you the feeling that everything's right. He said kids can ruin you, but they can also give you a reason to live when life tries to ruin you. She then visited Alex's office and told him that she was terrified of passing on her genes because she didn't know anything about her biological family's medical history. While she had learned to live with it, she didn't want that for their kids, which is why she decided to have her genome screened.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she got her test results back, she asked Maggie to open them with her. She turned out not to be the carrier of any major genetic diseases and the test also revealed the name of a probable first cousin of hers. Intern Casey overheard and offered to look her up and possibly her relatives. Later, she stood in the audience as Maggie gave an interview about finding her biological family in Seattle, which Jo took as a sign to find her own biological mother. Speaking from experience, Jackson warned her that it can also make for a negative experience. For him, it only created more pain. After saying goodbye Alex and Helen as they left for their trip back to Iowa, Jo looked up Casey and asked if he could find her birth mother. He said he could and asked if she wanted him to. She said yes, after which he revealed he couldn't help himself and had already found her. He showed her a picture and told her her name was Vicki Rudin and that she lived in Pittsburgh.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], x</ref> After Alex returned, she booked a ticket to Pittsburgh to go meet her mother. Alex was worried over what would happen, but she told him that the worst that could happen was that her mother wouldn't want to see her, and then she'd just come home to him and at least she'd know.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jo meets her mother.]]\nIn Pittsburgh, Jo went to Vicki's big house and introduced herself. She immediately discovered that Vicki had two kids. Thinking she was a saleswoman, Vicki tried to end the conversation, but Jo name dropped Emerson Hospital. Vicki started to give directions, but Jo clarified that that was where she was born before she was left at a fire station on th Street. She then told Vicki she was her mother. Vicki told Jo she couldn't be there, at which point Vicki's husband and dog came back from their walk. Vicki claimed Jo was a Mormon and her husband took the dog inside. Jo then asked Vicki for one conversation at a diner nearby. Vicki didn't answer and just closed the door. Jo went to the diner and waited for quite a while. Just when she gave up and got ready to leave, Vicki showed up.\n\nReluctantly, she sat down and told Jo she was late for work at the Mayor's office. Jo then brought up her big house and family. She told Vicki she didn't need money. She told Vicki she had always thought that her mother had a terrible life and had no choice but to leave Jo. Vicki told her that she wanted a better life for Jo than she could give her. Jo inquired about Vicki's kids and husband, who Vicki told her was not her father. Jo then threw in her face that she never found that better life Vicki had wanted for her. No one found her adoring parents and she lived in foster homes so bad that as soon as a man told her he loved her, she believed him so bad that she couldn't see he was abusing her. She sincerely hoped that whatever life Vicki had, it was worse than that. Distraught, Vicki got up to leave. Jo commented at least she was consistent. Vicki then told her she succeeded if she came here to punish her. Jo said she just wanted to know where she came from. Vicki sat back down and talked about her heritage and family medical history, but Jo got all that from the DNA test. She wanted information that that test couldn't provide her with. Vicki sarcastically dashed out some trivia about herself. Jo then asked about her father so she could find him, to which Vicki coldly replied that he died in a motorcycle accident  years. She had hoped for a more painful death after all the hurt he had caused her. Thinking Vicki was just bitter because her childhood sweetheart didn't pan out, Jo got up to leave. Vicki then clarified that the man hurt her. She begged Jo to sit down. Jo complied. Vicki shared that he was a TA when she was a freshman in undergrad. He chased after her for weeks for a date and serenaded her with flowers and proclamations. Finally, she said yes to the date. Then she said no on the date when he started to kiss and touch her, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. Nine months later, she had Jo and five days later, she didn't.\n\nVicki told Jo how she managed to hide her pregnancy. Years after the rape, Vicki found her way to therapy, which is the first time she ever talked about it. It was only then that she came to terms with the word rape, because she had consented to the date. Somehow, because she knew the man, she thought that what he took from her didn't matter, but she found a way to realize that it did and to move forward. Jo questioned why she never once tried to find her. Vicki said she was petrified every moment of the pregnancy. She had to see that man every day in class and she was terrified Jo would be a boy who would have his face and voice. Every movement of Jo as a fetus reminded her of where the baby came from. But books and movies and magazines talk about this instantaneous love you feel the minute your baby is born. She kept telling herself that as soon as she had the baby in her arms, it would happen to her, too. She gave the hospital a fake name and on the same day as giving birth, she went home with Jo because she had get out of there. She wanted it to be the two of them and stare at her and hold her until that love came. It did come. Her heart cracked wide open, but it was never just the two of them. Everything about Jo reminded her of him. That's why she had to give her up.\n\nJo talked about being abandoned caused her to leave people that loved her before they could leave her and that every moment of her life, she was waiting for her mother to find her and tell her she was sorry about that. Vicki said she did the best she could. Jo replied that would have been to find her a loving family instead of tossing her aside like garbage. Vicki said it's easy to look back and see what she could have been done better, but she was a different person back then. She wasn't in her right mind. Vicki shared details of her rape and said that was the night she lost her right mind. He stole that for her and for nine months, she pretended she was fine. The day Jo was born, she could feel again for the first time since the rape, but her mind took years to come back and part of it never did. Vicki admitted Jo deserved better, but she really didn't have better to give her. Jo shared how she was seven weeks pregnant when her ex-husband cracked her ribs and threw her across the living room floor. She decided in that moment he could never know about the pregnancy. She couldn't see a way out back then. She knew leaving him would mean he'd kill her and she couldn't raise a kid in that fear and danger, so she had an abortion. She had never told anyone. Jo tried to take Vicki's hand to comfort her, but Vicki pulled away. Jo then asked if she looked like her father. Vicki admitted she did, a few features aside. Vicki apologized and said she was still doing the best she could. She then walked out, leaving a distraught Jo behind.<ref>[[Silent All These Years]], x</ref> Alex found her in bed at night. She pretended to be asleep, but as he got ready for bed, she continued crying.<ref>[[Add It Up]], x</ref>\n\nShe started to avoid Alex by going to work while he was in the shower. He found her at work and told her she could tell him what had happened, but she used a grant application for her fellowship as an excuse to go find Bailey, who would resume her Chief duties the next day. She ran into a confused and wounded [[Abby Redding]] in the lobby and Jo took her to the ER. Jo and Dahlia got ready to stitch up her face lac, which she claimed was caused by a cabinet door. However, as soon as Andrew showed up with a message from Bailey, Abby tightly grabbed Jo's hand upon seeing him. Jo caught that there was something going and had Andrew tell Bailey that she would be a while. After noticing that Abby was experiencing abdominal pain, too, Jo had Dahlia close the curtains and sent her away. Abby then revealed bruises all over her body and Jo promised her she was not going anywhere.\n\nDahlia and Jo took her private exam room and Teddy joined them. They asked if they could call someone, but Abby didn't want to bother her husband on his business trip. Teddy got consent to check for internal injuries with an ultrasound. Jo held her hand throughout the procedure. Teddy diagnosed a tear in her diaphragm, which would require surgery. Abby consented as she really wanted it to be over. Teddy asked Jo to speak privately, but Abby refused to let her go. Suspicious of a possible sexual assault, Teddy had Dahlia book an OR and inform the nurses to hold off on antibiotic prep as to not erase any evidence. The doctors offered to get her a counselor, but Abby didn't want any more doctors. Abby continued to make up excuses for her bruises. Jo then bluntly said she thought her husband was abusing her, possibly sexually assault. Abby firmly defended her husband and asked to be taken to the OR. Jo stressed that that would mean washing away all the evidence. Abby denied she had anything to report. Jo informed her they could gather the evidence and seal it away until she was ready to report the assault. Abby said women are never believed. She admitted she was raped after getting drunk at a bar after a fight with her husband with laundry, but the short skirt and tequila would make it all her fault while her rapist's drink would be his excuse. Abby broke down and said the kit wouldn't prove that she wasn't flirting or that she wasn't making this up to cover up her cheating on her husband. Jo, still holding Abby's hand, then shared how her husband abused her for years. She, too, was convinced no one would believe her. She never had the chance to hold him responsible so she couldn't imagine what Abby was feeling at the moment, but one day, she might feel different and want justice. Jo just wanted her to have everything she would need to get it. Abby said her husband could never find out and then consented to the evidence kit. Jo continued to hold her hand as Abby consented to every step of the kit. As soon as it was over, Abby started shaking and sobbing and Jo comforted her.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jo walks Abby along the wall of women.]]\nWith Abby's condition worsening, they had to take her to the OR, but Abby started panicking. She couldn't bring herself to leave the room. She said every man had her rapist's face. It's all she could see. She begged the doctors not to make her see his face. Jo promised her she wouldn't have to. She came up with a plan and asked female staff to line the hallway from the room all the way to the elevator up to the OR floor. She held Abby's hand as they wheeled her all the way along the wall of women to the operating table. Jo promised Abby she would stay by her side. She held Abby's hand while Teddy fixed the tear. Teddy shared that she had seen many rape victims who had no clue how to talk about it. What Jo did today was not protocol, but she thought that it should be.\n\nIn post-op, they informed her the surgery had gone well and that they would keep the kit here until Abby decided to report it, if ever. While that decision was hers to make, the doctors urged her to talk to someone. Abby talked about she kept going through the night to see what she could have done differently to avoid it. Teddy firmly said it was not her fault. She did nothing to deserve this. Teddy left Abby with Jo. Abby said her husband would look at her and see a broken person. She thought that would be all he'd ever see if she were to tell him. Jo told her this did not define her. Whether she would tell people or not, she was a survivor. Jo shared that men in expensive shoes still make her nauseous because that's how Paul made her kidney bleed. For years, she thought she got what she deserved, that was responsible, that she could have avoided it if she had done some things differently. Abby told her that was not her fault and then realized the same was true for her. She then asked Jo for a phone to call her husband and asked for Jo to stay with her. Jo promised she'd stay as long as Abby needed her to.\n\nLater, Jo stood in the doorway as Abby gave her statement to the police with her husband by her side. Alex caught up with her and asked to go out to dinner to celebrate his no longer being Chief. She told him she had had a rough day and didn't feel like celebrating. She wanted to go home and crawl into bed. Alex wanted to join her, but she told him to go celebrate with Meredith. Alex tried to get her to open up about her birth mother, stating he wouldn't judge given his family history, but Jo insisted she didn't want to or could talk about it. She said she needed to go home alone and sleep and walked off without him.<ref>[[Silent All These Years]], x</ref>\n\nThe whole Pittsburgh experience triggered her abandonment issues and it made Jo clinically depressed. She kept Alex to leave her alone if he loved her and she claimed that she was sick so she could stay home from work and lie in bed all day. Worried about her, Alex sent over Link. He came by with chicken soup and forced her to let him in. While he grabbed bowls and spoons, she just climbed back into bed, disinterested in anything he had to say. He then started doing laundry for her. She told him to go, but he recalled a time a girlfriend dumped him and he drank for three days and he was so miserable, but she wouldn't leave him then despite his objections and she did his laundry for him, too. Jo then fetched a bottle of vodka from the freezer.\n\nThey got drunk together and she told him that that girlfriend had done him a favor by dumping him. She said she had done many people that favor, too. She talked about dating this guy named Logan while working at another restaurant. They dated for a while and the first time he told her he loved her, it made her feel the opposite of what it should. She felt like he was wrong for loving her, that she could not be loved, so she left, moved to another part of town and got a new job like none of it ever happened. She did the same thing to a guy in high school. And then she met Paul. She said her mother was and is a runner, too. She claimed she loved Jo, but she couldn't stand to be in the same room as her. She briefly tried to talk about her father, but she teared up and instead got another bottle of vodka. When Alex came home, he found her laughing hysterically at a cartoon. While he thought she was doing better, Link told him she was in a rough shape unlike anything he'd ever seen before. He was convinced she needed help, but he didn't know how to help her.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], x</ref>\n\nAlex convinced Jo to come back to work but her colleagues couldn't behave normal around her. Jackson found her buried in a mountain of work in her lab as a result of Bailey's being Chief again and her absence. To take her mind off it, he invited her to help him out on his spray-on skin project. She accepted, but continuously called the work boring and shut down every attempt Jackson made at asking about her birth mother, only telling him that he had been right to advice her not to do it. He pointed out she must have needed it to try since she did it. Looking back, she didn't understand why as she had everything to be happy and she just threw it all aside for nothing, and now it felt impossible to get that happiness back. She was convinced talking to Alex would only hurt more. Jackson revealed Meredith had asked him to check in on her. Jo says her coming to work was a sign of her doing her best. He knew that she came to work drunk and had vodka stored in her water bottle. He was glad she at least had the decency to do research instead of see patients today. He invited her to talk, but she declined. He told her she would not be met with compassion if she came to work drunk ever again. Alex found out about her being drunk at work and threatened to go to Pittsburgh himself to find out what happened. She told him she would leave him if he ever brought that up again and again told him that she would talk to him when she was ready to. They made a deal that he would tell Bailey if she came to work drunk again, so she promised not to do that anymore.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], x</ref>\n\nAlex put her on LEGO duty with Gus to avoid her having to deal with real cases. While she was building with Gus, a nurse came to fetch Jo to answer a call from the Head of Trauma at a hospital in Winnipeg. The doctor told her they had an Rh-Null patient and found Gus in a database. Excited, Jo told the doctor that she would find Alex and call her right back. She ran into Lori on her way to find him and shared that they found a donor. She also told Alex, who called her a good luck charm and gave her instructions to prepare Gus for the OR. Jo then called the doctor back and found out that the doctor was calling to see if Gus could donate for her patient, not the other way around. Upon returning to Gus's room, she overheard Lori making a call to her husband to share the news. Jo broke down and ran off. Ben found her sobbing in the hallway and tried to comfort her, but she ran off. She found Teddy and told her what happened and begged her to call in a favor from the military to correct the mistake. Teddy told her it wasn't a matter of jumping the line; there was no line to jump. Teddy tried to calm her down but found that Jo kept spiraling, so she asked Jo if she was doing okay. She offered to come talk to Lori with her, but Jo declined. Jo delivered the bad news. Lori lashed out because she had to call all these people back with bad news. Jo then broke down and Alex and Bailey found her sobbing in Lori's arms. Alex took her away and left her with Ben, who comforted Jo while Alex vented his despair over Jo's state of being in Bailey's office.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], x</ref>\n\nAlex switched places with Meredith in hopes that Meredith could get through to Jo. Meredith was determined to stay at the loft until Jo talked to her and ignored Jo's attempts to push her away. Meredith talked to her about understanding of pain, which came from deep experience, in an attempt to make Jo see that she would be able understand her pain. Jo told her that unless her father raped her mother and she looked just like him, she couldn't understand this. Jo then finally opened up and shared this experience of watching a girl who hurt herself in the playground be comforted by her mother. Ever since she was a kid, she imagined that her mother would hold her like that mother held her daughter if she ever found her, but now she knew that would never happen. She said she never should have existed in the first place and that everything that Paul had put her through was just her birthright.\n\nMeredith listed things that Jo helped her out with at work, how her love changed Alex, and how she prevented Paul from further abusing his fianc\uee. That was proof that violence was not her inheritance but something she had overcome. She told Jo she had an enormous heart and capacity for survival. She had survived something dark and used that experience to help other people, and if her mother couldn't see that, then that was on her. Meredith told her about her drowning and how she gave up, but the people who loved her pulled her through. That's why she was there with her. She asked Jo if she wanted to stop or if she just needed a few more days. Jo replied the latter. Meredith then told her they were going to talk to Bailey and Alex to get her a proper leave of absence so she could get the help that she needed.\n[[File:x-.jpg|thumb|Jo asks Meredith to go tell Alex while she waits for Bailey.]]\nThey arrived at the hospital and found that Bailey and Catherine were in a meeting. Jo asked Alex to go talk to Alex as she couldn't bring herself to do that, while she would wait for Bailey to finish her meeting. Meredith ordered Andrew to stay by Jo's side, but Bailey called him into the conference room.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], x</ref>\n\nMeredith's insurance fraud was discovered and Andrew had taken the fall for her. With him arrested and several attendings out, Bailey asked Jo if she could work. Jo said she could and went to the ER. She and Link waited for ambulances to bring in victims of the car pile-up that was caused by the fog. Link used the fog as a metaphor to tell Jo that despite her current state, the sun would shine again. They laughed at how bad that was. Bailey soon joined them and she agreed to talk with Jo later. The first ambulance brought in Owen and [[Frances Pinfield]], Gus's agoraphobic blood donor from London. Jo and Levi took her to get her blood drawn and Frances talked about how there was something freeing about being forced to walk through your worst fears. Jo then took the blood to Gus in the hyperbaric medicine lab. After the transfusion, she stayed behind to tell Alex, whom Meredith had informed about the cause of Jo's depression, that she was not fine despite her knowing how to rise when she had to. He promised her they would figure it out. He took her to the in-patient psychiatry department, where [[Olivia Fowler|Dr. Olivia Fowler]] got her checked in after she said goodbye to Alex.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], x</ref>\n\nDuring her checking in, Jo was rid off all things that might be a danger to her and she brought to her room, where she lied down and cried. After a week, she and Alex decided to have her committed into a psychiatric facility. Alex dropped her off and she told him she didn't want to be another name on his list of crazy people. She reminded him they weren't married and offered him an out. He didn't respond, so she just walked away and checked herself in.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nShe met her therapists, one of whom was [[Carly Davis]]. Carly wanted to try to EMDR and since Jo had no interest in being there, she offered to let Jo go if she could explain EMDR in  seconds or less. She failed to mention how it illuminates your capital T, trauma, so Carly made her stay. Jo denied having undergone trauma and commented on Carly not sharing any of her almonds, which Carly attributed to maintaining boundaries with her patients. They then started the EMDR therapy, which brought up that Jo felt shame for not being in her safe place, the OR. When asked about memories that gave her the same feeling, Jo admitted she kept replaying her mother pulling her hand away at the diner over and over. Carly stated they'd work on that. However, Jo didn't feel like doing the work and tried to sneak out in the middle of the night. As the therapist on guarding duty, Carly caught her. She had suspected Jo would run off. Jo admitted she didn't know why she wanted to run as she was feeling shame for things she didn't do but instead for things that were done to her. Carly pointed out Jo was used to being exceptional while at this point, she was like everyone else in the facility, mentally, stuck in one moment that seemed like it was defining her entire life. Carly thought it was not about her mother walking away from her and told her she would need to move through the fear and shame to anger. Jo told her she couldn't do that, meaning she would be stuck there forever.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nAfter three weeks, she and Alex met with her doctor present. Jo told him that during her depressive episode, she felt fear, shame, and pain. She was ashamed that she had lost the ability to receive the love that he was giving. She had pushed him away and she was afraid she would never be able to regain his trust. Jo thought he had had enough crazy for a lifetime and said he deserved someone stronger than her. Her doctor pointed out that her decision to come to the facility made her stronger than most, in spite of what society made her believe.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nThe next day, Jo reached that stage of anger and burst into Carly's office to tell her she hated everything; her mother and her pulling away, her rapist father, and Paul. With a smile, Carly pointed out she had made a breakthrough by moving into the anger. Jo told her she couldn't get angry because she was afraid she could never stop being angry and then she would become like Paul. Carly informed her she needed to learn what healthy anger looked like. Jo thought she was preparing her for another EMDR session and said she couldn't have that now. Carly was proud of her for finally asking for what she wanted. She brought out a bucket of soft toys and started throwing them at the wall. She invited Jo to join her and told her they were consenting adults who were okay with throwing things at walls instead of people. That set them apart from Paul since they were feeling the anger yet still controlling their behavior. She then started throwing the toys hard and started screaming until the anger had left her body. They sat down and Carly shared that she used to be a Safe Haven volunteer. No matter how fast she would get to a fire station after a call, the baby was always wrapped up in a warm blanket, surrounded by love, when she got there. She explained that while Jo didn't have a memory of her mother abandoning her, her brain and body had a memory of her pulling away, which was triggered by what happened at the diner. However, despite that, it was important for Jo to remember that, just like as a baby, she was still surrounded by love.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nAt the end of her treatment a week later, she was surprised when Alex showed up to pick her up. He got on one knee and admitted he had thought about leaving her because he was scared, but he had come to realize that he was stronger with her by his side, in sickness and health. She reminded him she wasn't magically fixed, but he didn't care and asked her to marry him again. She happily accepted and they shared a kiss.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], x</ref>\n\nOn her first day back to work, Jo prepared herself to be looked at like she was a fragile bird. Alex wanted to smooth things over and offered her a job at Pac-North, allowing her to run her own fellowship, but Jo's therapist had told her that she needed to return to her life without making too many changes, so she went back to Grey Sloan. Bailey was surprised to see her and, upon hearing Alex's offer, made her the exact same one. Jo took the day to think about them and ran into Link, who told her that Amelia was pregnant with his child. While she listened to his concerns about raising a child, Alex called her to check in on her and offered to make her an attending general surgeon after hearing about Bailey's counteroffer. She returned to Link and assured him he would be a great dad if he wanted to be one. Afterwards, she found Bailey and requested to be made attending general surgeon at Grey Sloan, stating she knew her worth and would be an asset to any hospital, which Bailey could decide could be her hospital. Bailey and Jo talked in her office and Bailey conceded. Jo came home and told Alex that she had leveraged his offer to make Bailey hire her at Grey Sloan. Alex recognized that Grey Sloan was better for her career and advised her to demand a parking space, to which Jo replied that Bailey had given her his parking space.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], x</ref>\n\nBailey made a concession by allowing Jo to perform an ALPPS procedure in her first week as an attending to express her trust in Jo's capabilities. However, [[Shirley Gregory|the patient]] didn't want to let anybody but Meredith operate on her despite Jo having been trained by Meredith. Jo then got Bailey to consent to having Meredith supervise her every move through video chat, during which Meredith convinced the patient that Jo was great, which got her to consent. The surgery went well despite a small touch-and-go moment with an unexpected bleeding, which Jo handled. After she finished, Bailey and the entire staff applauded for her. While Meredith was in the middle of congratulating Jo, Bailey hung up on her.<ref>[[Reunited]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith's article was published as a slash-and-burn expos\ue on Grey Sloan, Jo was concerned for the hospital. She went to Bailey to request to be allowed to schedule more ALPPS procedures for her but Bailey was too busy handling the fall-out of the article to hear her. However, when Bailey commented she felt hot, Jo suggested the stress may have gotten to her heart, which worried Bailey. Later, Meredith pulled Jo into a staircase to find out how the hospital was coping with the negative press. Jo admitted it had the residents panicking while the other staff was divided between supporting her and loathing her. Jo stated she was worried about Bailey's health and wished Meredith good luck when she heard Meredith wanted to clear the air between them. Afterwards, she ran into Jackson and told him it must be freeing for Meredith to do what she felt was right without worrying about the optics, which inspired Jackson to do the right thing with [[Clervie Martin]].<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], x</ref>\n\nAt work, Jo came across Bailey and Levi as they wheeled [[Carly Davis]] into the hyperbaric chamber to treat a carbon monoxide poisoning. Jo recognized her and inserted herself onto the case, taking Levi's place. Once the chamber was sealed, Bailey found how Jo was connected to Carly. Jo explained she was just one of her three therapists at the center. Bailey inquired why Carly had wanted to commit suicide but Jo had no clue. She noticed how her hands shook as she worked. She laughed about having forgotten everything Carly had taught her about keeping her nervous system calm. She continued to panic and stated she was back to square one. She wanted to leave but couldn't because the chamber was sealed. She wondered what it meant for her if the one person who was supposed to make her feel better could go off and attempt suicide. She started listing the steps of a chest tube, which was a trick she had learnt in therapy to calm herself. However, as it didn't work and she kept spiraling, Bailey blurted out that she was pregnant in order to distract Jo, which worked. Bailey admitted to being excited but terrified. Jo corrected her and said both feelings could coexist at the same. Bailey started to panic, too, so Jo now had her recite something she knew by heart to calm her down, which worked on her. Carly then inexplicably started seizing after starting to get better, which lead to Jo suggesting she was diabetic, which she figured was the reason behind Carly's incessant almond eating. They corrected her hypoglycemia, which improved her status.\n\nCarly was taken to the ICU and Jo insisted on seeing the case through. Before she headed into the room to check on Carly, Bailey told her she had watched Jo teeter on the edge and bring herself as well as Bailey back from that all the while saving Carly's life, which told her Jo was far from back at square one. Carly then woke up and Jo informed her she was calling psych as was required for all suicide attempts. Carly revealed she hadn't tried to kill herself. Her CO detector battery had been dead for months and she passed out while reading a book. Jo then decided she couldn't be Carly's doctor anymore because of boundaries, which made Carly proud. At home that night, Jo told Alex she had had a rough day but didn't want to talk about it; Instead, she started throwing toys at the wall to get herself to an okay state of mind. Alex joined her and the laughed as he hit a lamp.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], x</ref>\n\nJo had the day off on Halloween and she decided to stay home and scare trick-or-treaters with her bloodied bride costume, which had failed to scare Alex. Jo tried to sneak up on him at Pac-North to scare him but to no avail. He told her a graveyard was discovered in the construction site outside and had her help out when several patients in the ICU started crashing simultaneously, which made Jo believe the hospital was haunted. Together, Alex, Jo, and Owen figured out all patients had received transfusions from blood that had been stored in a faulty fridge. While Alex handled the crisis with investors walking around, Jo waited for him in his office. He came in and said he had impressed the investors with his ability to handle chaos, which is why they awarded him with the funding he had been after. To celebrate, he took Jo to the courthouse to get married. While still wearing her bloodied wedding dress, she told him she was pregnant during her vows. He was startled and she laughed as she finally got to scare him. She assured him she was not pregnant and the ceremony continued.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing before the medical committee, Jo warned the residents that they were on their own since most of the attendings were out to attend the hearing, like Jo herself. She warned her to only call her for urgent matters. After finishing up at the hospital, she took off to the hotel. She arrived late, just in time to watch a distressed Levi storm out of the room. She was informed he had been the one to report Meredith to Bailey. Later, she assisted Alex with his surprise of bringing in a group of patients who had been treated and saved by Meredith as well as reading letters of support by former colleagues of Meredith's. Jo was among the group who heard the verdict and congratulated Meredith as she got to keep her license.<ref>[[My Shot]], x</ref>\n\n\nLink and Amelia came across a stressed-out Jo at the hospital. She informed them she had signed up to become a Safe Haven volunteer, like Carly, and had just received a call about a baby having been dropped off at [[SFD Station ]]. Since Alex was out of town to see his mother, she asked Link to come with her. Since he thought she was taking on too much too soon, he offered to cancel his surgery but she declined and said she'd be fine. She entered the station and met [[Victoria Hughes]], whom she recognized as Jackson's girlfriend. [[Dean Miller]] and Ben then brought over the baby, whom they estimated to be three days old. Ben then gave Jo a tour. They sat down in the break room to feed the baby. Jack came by and she told him she had been dropped off at a fire station as a baby herself. They then bonded over having been in the foster system. [[Jack Gibson|Jack]] informed her the SFD has about seven babies per year who are left stations. Jo thought there'd be more abandoned babies. Ben pointed out they use the word \"surrendered\" and try not to judge. While feeding the baby, Jo told Ben she had thought volunteering would be different. She had expected to feel an understanding and forgiveness for her mother but it actually had the opposite effect. Ben reminded her of the effect trauma can have on people. Ben offered her a ride to the hospital so she could drop the baby off as the baby's exam was all good. Jo added he was all good except for the fact that his parents didn't want him. Ben said the people who gave birth to the baby didn't want him; he had yet to meet his parents. Ben dropped her off at the hospital but he ran off as he received a worrying text about Bailey, leaving Jo alone at the ER entrance. She then turned around and took the baby home. Link came to visit her after a distressing call and as he saw the baby there, she admitted it was too much too soon.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], x</ref>\n\nJo explained to Link she wanted the baby to have one cozy night. Link pointed out she did something illegal. Meredith came over to vent about Cormac and understood Jo's decision regarding the baby. When they got paged for the traumas resulting from a car crash into Joe's bar, Jo decided to sneak the baby into the nursery and pretend he had been there all night. In the nursery, she met [[Cormac Hayes]] and realized he was the one that Cristina had sent for Meredith. He had heard great things about Alex. The exam turned out fine and Cormac gave Jo a few minutes before involving social services. He talked about having missed his own two boys growing up as he was a resident back when they were little. Jo cuddled the boy and told him he would have people looking out for him despite his bumpy start. After handing him over to the social worker, Jo told Link she had fallen in love with that boy a little bit. He understood, having a child on the way himself, and invited her to come hang with his child anytime. Later, Jo caught a glimpse of Meredith chatting with Cormac and told her that she could see something happening between the two.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working a busy ER shift, Link told Jo that Amelia's baby might not be his. They scrubbed in for surgery and he told Jo that it wouldn't change anything for him and that Amelia didn't want a paternity test anyway. Jo pointed out he didn't just have to be okay with it and that he could love her and be mad at her at the same time.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], x</ref> After Link convinced Amelia to get a paternity test anyway, Amelia began to avoid him. Jo ran into her and told her that Link was allowed to have his feelings and that she should stop avoiding him. She added that you should give the people you love all the information in order to give them the chance to rise to the occasion. She admitted Alex was ignoring her, which make her anxious. She later ran into [[Joey Phillips]] and, using her own history with the foster system, made him see that he had to take care of himself before he could be reunited with his siblings. She and Bailey operated on his arm to restore proper blood flow. Jo said Joey had a tough time ahead as no one would adopt a -year-old boy who looked like he could fend for himself. As they watched him sleep post-op, Jo told a worried Bailey that both she and Alex had been like Joey and that the two of them turned out fine. She then went home to her empty loft.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], x</ref>\n\nDespite Jo's attempt to reconcile the two, Amelia continued to ignore Link, much like Alex kept ignoring Jo. A patient of hers had jumped in front of a bear to protect his wife and Jo felt like a bear was headed for her and Link. Link assured her Alex would tell her all about his family situation when he returned. Jo told Link that Amelia was like this sometimes, citing the time Amelia ignored Owen and camped out on Stephanie's couch. She and Owen found out that the woman who had been saved by her husband was actually cheating on him. That together with Alex ignoring her made Jo think about the worst case scenarios as to why Alex was keeping her in the dark. Later, Jo had to inform her patient that her husband had died, causing her to turn down the man she has been cheating with. After witnessing the heartbreak, Jo left Alex a message asking him to call her as she needed to know what was going on, whatever it was. She concluded by saying she would jump in front of a bear for him.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], x</ref> During the Seattle blizzard, Jo had a busy day taking care of [[Tess Anderson]]. She decided to reach out to [[Helen Karev]] and found out that Alex wasn't with her, nor had he been. While sitting alone at home with a glass of wine, she heard movement at the door and rushed to open it, believing Alex had finally returned. Instead, it was Link, who had come to bring her some comfort food. Jo told Link about what she had found, which had convinced her that Alex had truly left her. She broke down and Link comforted her.<ref>[[Snowblind]], x</ref>\n\nSince she couldn't bear to live in the loft by herself, she temporarily stayed at Link's place. He went by her place to pick up some of her stuff and brought it to the hospital with him. He also brought her her mail, which included a letter from Alex. Link offered to sit with her but she wanted to read it on her own. He wrote that he didn't want to do it like this, that she deserved more than this. He wrote that he loved her, her bravery and resilience, all of her. However, he had to tell her that he was also in love with Izzie. He recalled the time he told her about the life he had imagined for Izzie with kids and that he was now suddenly a part of that picture. He confessed that he had used Meredith's trial as an excuse to reach out to her and they got to talking and it felt like no time had passed. He was now living on a farm with Izzie and he felt like belonged there, because Izzie had his kids. He knew that Jo would understand that he couldn't leave and miss another second of their lives after having already missed five years. He hoped Jo loved him enough to let him take the chance to make his kids' lives whole, to give them the family he and Jo had never had. He wanted to do everything he could to make that life work. He stressed that he had meant everything about his life with Jo and that he wished getting the family that he always wanted didn't mean having to hurt Jo in the process. He admitted he couldn't come back to tell her in person because he wouldn't be able to walk away from her again. He thanked her for taking care of him, for making him kinder. He got her divorce papers and decided to leave her everything, including his shares in Grey Sloan, because she deserved everything good in life. He ended his letter by writing he hoped she could find someone better than him and apologized once more. After she was done reading the letter, Link wanted to take her day drinking but she decided to focus on her work, scrubbing in with Maggie. Link told her she was his hero. She shared the sentiment.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\nAs she couldn't bear to be in the loft by herself, Link moved in with her to keep her company while he was working out his problems with Amelia. En route to work, Jo uttered disgust over a young couple making out on the platform, stating all love sucks eventually. At work, the young man was brought after having been electrocuted after falling onto the tracks. Link and Jo operated on the man with Amelia. He pulled through but he would need extensive physical therapy. His lover did not want to stay and take care of him while she was supposed to move to England to pursue her dream. Link commented on how fast their love fizzled out, thinking Jo had been right. However, Jo had changed her mind. She tried to hate Alex but couldn't bring herself to do that. While she was mad and hurt over his leaving her, the love he had shown her made grow as a person so she was confident she could get back on her feet. He made her feel worthy of love and she would always remember that. She then advised Link not to blow things with Amelia, who at least had given Link a choice. Jo then went to the bar by herself, where Andrew tried to hit on her. She threw her drink in his face and told him to get help.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], x</ref>  \n\nOn Meredith's pro bono surgery day, Meredith called Jo at  am to request her help. Jo got off her couch, where she had been sleeping since Alex left, took off her wedding ring, and headed into work. She got word from Link that Amelia's baby was his. As Meredith divided her patients between the surgeons who had agreed to participate, she wondered how to address Jo now. Jo decided she would go by \"Dr. Jo\" until further notice. After turning down an invitation from Jackson to go to a game with him, Jo scrubbed in with Owen. He went to express his sympathies for her but she didn't want to be reminded of Alex while in her happy place. He let her know she was always welcome if she were in need of company. After a long day at work, Jo came across a sad Levi at the bar. He had broken up with Nico and was out of a place to live. Jo then invited him to stay with her. She explained the loft was too empty and she didn't want to be chased out of the place she had bought for herself. Levi gladly accepted her offer.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], x</ref>\n\nJo and Levi subsequently developed a close friendship. He told her about the little things his mom did for him while he used to live with her, which Jo commented didn't sound so bad. With all the attendings gathering for Richard's case, Jo was put in charge of the ER, where Levi came to help her out. He was distracted all day by focusing on Nico's social media posts until Jo pointed out he was missing his chance to shine. At night, Levi came home while Jo was watching TV and he announced he was moving out, because he had taken her comments to mean that he was overstaying his welcome. She explained she was snapping at him as his superior but his presence at home was the only thing keeping her sane, so she convinced him to stay.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\nWhile working a case with Cormac and Jackson, Jo contemplated using a dating app but decided she was feeling too miserable to date yet. Cormac expressed hate over being set up, at which point Jo hinted that he had his own personal matchmaker. He inquired about her comment but she brushed it off, choosing not to share her knowledge of Cristina's intentions for him and Meredith.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], x</ref>\n\n\nNear the end of March , Jo approached Jackson to ask him for sex. She wanted to have sex with someone she trusted to get over Alex, like a bridge to the other side of feeling like a sad sack. While surprised by her random proposition, Jackson accepted and they agreed to meet up that night. She showed up at his place with a bottle of booze and found he had set up for a date with romantic music. She mocked him for that and they shared the bottle she brought while she commented on having never been with someone as rich as him. They then proceeded to make out until Jo started sobbing. They stopped and he comforted her on the couch.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\n\nShortly after their disastrous encounter, the coronavirus hit the United States. They worked the frontlines at Grey Sloan Memorial as Seattle was one of the cities hit hardest in April . They worked together with some awkward tension on [[Kayden Lee]], a kid who broke quarantine to go party with his friends and ended up being burned. As they scrubbed in for his surgery, Jo commented that people do stupid things. During the surgery, Jo continued to snap at Jackson. They managed to stabilize Kayden. Once he got settled in his room, Jackson told Jo he could apologize for their awkward encounter if that would help her be less angry. She revealed she was actually ashamed for crying and snotting into his mouth rather than angry at him. She admitted she hadn't been ready for casual sex. They agreed to pretend their encounter had never happened so they could go back to being friends.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], x</ref>\n\nWith their friendship, Jo found Jackson in Kayden's room to get an update for Kayden's father. They found that Kayden's burns had gone through his chest wall. They rushed him back to surgery. Together with Teddy and Maggie, they tried to save him but lost him on the table. Jo found a crying Teddy in the attendings' lounge. Having heard about her affair with Tom, she told Teddy she had no sympathy for her. Teddy snapped at her to mind her own business, to which Jo replied that Teddy was to blame for having blown up her own life. Teddy bluntly said it wasn't her fault that Alex had left Jo and she questioned if Jo had never hurt someone she loved or sabotaged her own happiness because it felt so unfamiliar. Jo then softened up a little and advised Teddy to try harder to talk to Owen.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], x</ref> At some point during the pandemic, Jo started going to virtual therapy three times a week to process Alex leaving her.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Meredith was admitted with COVID, Jo took over her service. Jo and Levi watched a message from Richard together, stating there were enough tests available for all personnel and that residents were no longer allowed to work on patients with an unknown COVID status. Jo was working the ER. She had a brief run-in with Link, who was adjusting to life as a new dad. Levi came to fetch Jo for [[Val Ashton]], a patient with abdominal pain. Val's labs revealed that she was pregnant yet the ultrasound didn't show a fetus. A scan revealed a hepatic pregnancy. Carina and Jo planned to deliver the baby as soon as possible since the placental growth could cause a major bleeding. After multiple rounds of failed IVF over  years, Val was delighted that a drunken one-night stand had given her a baby after her ex-husband had blamed her as the reason for them not being able to conceive. She consented to the surgery and said she was ready to meet her baby girl Luna. Cormac and Carina rushed Luna to the NICU while Bailey and Jo took care of Val, with Jo standing up to Bailey for her surgical plan. Afterward, Bailey found Jo spending time with the baby in the NICU and told her that her work had not gone unnoticed. While appreciative of her comments, Jo said Meredith had to get better. Bailey agreed. Jo spent the rest of the night by Luna's side.<ref>[[My Happy Ending]], x</ref>\n\nJust as Jo found out that murder hornets had been spotted in the U.S., Jackson invited Jo to come hang out at his place. She accepted as long as he was paying for the food. Over beers that night, they talked about Meredith. Jo reminisced about the long way they had come since the time that Meredith used to kick Jo out of Alex's bed. Jackson said Meredith was a force of nature. They agreed she would beat the virus. Jo woke up the next morning on the couch. He had ordered them breakfast. She thanked him for their friendship reboot and then pulled him in for a kiss, stating she was ripping off the band-aid. They had amazing sex on the couch. Jo commented it was more than a bridge. They agreed to go again right away so it would all count as one time, so they wouldn't become a thing. Afterward, Jo headed to work and ran into Levi in the parking lot. He figured she had worked overnight since she wasn't home in the morning. She said she had been exercising. As Nico passed by, Jo derived from Levi's face that him and Nico were hooking up again. Levi defended himself by saying that the Dutch government had advised its citizens to find one designated sex partner to keep things safe during the pandemic. That inspired Jo to go back to Jackson's place that night. Thinking she was looking for something more, he told her he couldn't be in a relationship right now as he had moved on too soon after April and Maggie. Jo said that she was still working to put herself back together, so she only wanted a designated sex partner. He agreed to that and let her in.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], x</ref>\n\nWhen she was called into a delivery due to hospital policy while passing through the hall, she discovered the joy of OB/GYN, and began to consider switching specialties amid a dark time in her life because surgery wasn't bringing her any happiness. When she decided to go for it, Bailey wouldn't approve of it at first due to the surgical staff shortage but later relented and Jo officially became an OB/GYN resident under [[Carina DeLuca]].\n\n\n\n[[Chris Cleaver]]\nChris was Jo's first boyfriend. In , when Jo was in high school and her car was about to be towed, Chris paid the driver so that he didn't take her car. They started dating and he liked that she lived in her car and wanted her to meet his parents. She agreed to meeting them, but when he asked her to move to his college with him, she took off and drove her car to another state.<ref>[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]], x</ref>\n\n[[Paul Stadler]]\nJo was married to Paul, but he was extremely abusive. One incident left her with an almost ruptured kidney. Another time, he cracked her ribs and threw her across the living room floor. Unbeknownst to Paul, Jo was  weeks pregnant at the time, but had an abortion soon after, because she knew he would kill her if she ran away, but she also knew she could not raise a child under Paul's fear and violence. Later, she ran from him for good, and she knew that if she filed a divorce, he would find her and possibly harm her, so she changed her identity and started a new life in another city, still technically married to him.\n\nYears later, Paul found Jo in Seattle and confronted her. He said to her that they needed to get divorced so that he and his [[Jenny (Season )|fianc\uee]] can get married. They signed divorce papers.<ref>[[---]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Paul became the victim of a hit-and-run, he suffered a concussion, but this was made worse when he injured his head on a bed frame and his brain began to swell, leaving him brain dead. Jo, who was still legally his wife as the divorce papers hadn't gone through yet, decided to donate his organs, stating that some good should come out of his death since his life brought evil.<ref>[[Personal Jesus]], x</ref>\n\n[[Jason Myers]]\nJo had a crush on Jason when she started working at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. Jo and the other interns gave Jason the nickname of Chest Peckwell. Eventually, Jo and Jason began a romantic relationship. However, Jason and Alex constantly butted heads over allegations that Alex had feelings for Jo. Alex would inform Jason of Jo's troubled past, causing an argument.  During that argument, Jason physically harmed Jo, causing her to move out and end the relationship. It was later revealed that Jo nearly killed Jason when she fought back, even to the extent of a brain bleed. He demanded to see the police but was convinced otherwise after being threatened by Alex.<ref>[[Readiness is All]], x</ref>\n\n[[Alex Karev]]\nShortly after first meeting her and telling her that he likes \"chicks with boy names,\" Jo assured Alex that as he had already slept with all of her friends, she wasn't interested in him.<ref>[[Love the One You're With]], x</ref> Alex frequently referred to Jo Wilson as \"princess\" due to her so-called 'prissy' manners and attitude. She revealed to Alex her past life difficulties and the two became close friends after bonding at Bailey's wedding. They got along very well and they often drank together. However, they hit a snag when Jo began dating [[Jason Myers]]. After a huge fight between Jo and Jason, Jo revealed to [[Alex Karev|Alex]] that [[Jason Myers|Jason]] had hit her during the argument. Alex admitted to Cristina that he loved Jo, but that he was scared to tell her because of past failed relationships. During the superstorm, Alex finally admitted to Jo that he loved her and the couple shared a kiss. They hit a bit of a rocky patch when Alex's dad came into the hospital from a car crash related to drugs. Alex asked Jo to do a paternity test and he said he didn't want to know at the same time she said: \"he's your father.\" Alex then proceeded to stalk his father at bars where he was performing. When Alex didn't come home for  nights in a row, Jo got worried. He then told her what was happening and they worked it out. Alex really knew he loved Jo then.\n\nWhen Alex's father returned to the hospital going through withdrawal, Jo tried to handle him but found herself in over her head. Alex told her it wasn't her fault and that he'd been this way his whole life. At April's wedding, Alex told Jo that they would be together forever and were the only family each other needs. He said that if they do have kids, they will be great parents and will not need anyone else then share a passionate kiss. When Alex called Jo his fianc\uee, she told him that she didn't realize his speech at the wedding was a proposal and that she was not walking out on him, but she wasn't ready for marriage. She comforted Alex when his dad died.\n\nWhen Leah issued a complaint to HR, the non-fraternization rule was put in place, forbidding unmarried couples of different authority levels to continue seeing each other. Alex and Jo faked a fight in front of the hospital, allowing them to believe they broke up while secretly staying together. Meredith gave Alex a love contract for them both to sign so they could continue working and seeing each other without getting into trouble. When Jo refused to sign it, Alex assured her that it wasn't a scary document to anything. She can't count on him because anything could happen at any minute. The contract just made it so that he could kiss her when he wants to. She signed and they shared a kiss. When Alex was offered a new job at a pediatric private practice, he sought Jo's advice and she was very supportive of him. She told him that working two jobs made him like a double agent which is very sexy. Alex took the job and Jo was very proud of him, telling him he'll do great.\n\nLater Alex proposed to Jo. She did not give him an answer and said she had to think about it. When he asked for a real answer, she said no. She was at [[Emerald City Bar|Joe's Bar]] with Stephanie later that day and she got drunk. Stephanie then left her in the hands of [[Andrew DeLuca]]. He then took Jo home. She told Andrew how she rejected Alex\us proposal, and that she didn\ut want to. She confessed to him that she was married to a man who almost beat her to death. She then took off her shirt and pants in front of Andrew and she accidentally pulled him into the bed. Alex then walked in the apartment, and to him it looked like Andrew was trying to rape a drunk Jo, so Alex almost beat Andrew to death. Alex turned himself in after Andrew was brought to the hospital and went to jail, only to be bailed out by Meredith. Jo was frightened by this side of Alex and they broke up.\n\nWhile Alex was working in the clinic, Jo was subpoenaed to testify at Alex\us trial, she told him she was married. She said that it could all come out in court and that\us why she couldn\ut marry him. She wanted him to know if she just disappeared after the trial, it wasn\ut because of him, it was because she didn\ut want her husband to find her. Alex took this information and went to the DA to take the plea bargain he was offered. Andrew then heard about this and went to the DA to drop the charges.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], x</ref>\n\nLater, Alex went to find Jo\us husband, [[Paul Stadler]], and confront him. He saw him but didn\ut confront him because he knew it would make things worse. Alex then found out that Jo wouldn\ut take him back because she was afraid he would hurt her. After Alex found this out, he went to Jo and confessed that he went to confront Paul, but he didn\ut do anything. He assured her that he\us done stupid things, but he would never hurt her. Ever. Jo then kissed him and they got back together.\n\nWhen Jo and Alex had a patient with a failed \"HoCoPro\", [[Pete Hover|Pete]], Jo waited for Alex after work with a sign that had \"Homecoming?\" written on it. Alex asked if Jo was asking him to a dance, but then Jo said that she wanted Alex to come home.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], x</ref>\n\nJo saw how good Alex was with his patients, especially [[Kimmie Park|Kimmie]] and [[Charlie Peterson|Charlie]], so that night, when Alex came home, Jo had filled their apartment with candles. She started talking about how she and Alex together just made sense. Alex, realizing what was happening, went to find the engagement ring. When he couldn't find the ring, Jo showed him that she was wearing it. Jo knelt down in front of Alex and said, \"You are my home, and you are my heart. Alex Karev, will you marry me?\" Alex then kissed her and said, \"That's a hell yes\".\n\nAfter [[Kimmie Park|Kimmie]] left the hospital, Alex was sitting in her patient room when Jo walked in and told him that she wanted to have kids with him, and that she also wanted to take his name when they got married because she'd never had the last name of anyone who loved her.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], x</ref>\n\nWhile stressing out about planning their wedding, [[April Kepner|April]] came to help them out. She told them she would plan their wedding, but when Alex was going through his bank account, he noticed something and didn't tell Jo for the rest of the day. That day, [[Olivia Jankovic|Nurse Olivia]] came back to the hospital with her son who has swallowed a whistle. Olivia then spent the day making fun of Alex for his past behavior, especially the time he gave her syphilis. When Olivia found out that Alex and Jo were engaged, she wished Jo \"the best of luck with that\". After Olivia and Alex talked, he was leaving and she said \"She's too good for you\" and to that Alex replied \"You don't think I know that\". But that night when Jo came home, she was worried about what Alex saw on his bank account and assured him that she didn't care if he was having money problems, but he told her there was too much money in the account and that his mother, [[Helen Karev]], hadn't been cashing the checks he'd been sending her. Alex and Jo then went to Iowa only to find that Alex's mom was doing great and back at work. When his mom said that his presence was upsetting her, Jo took him to the batting cage to calm down. Alex then went back to the library and introduced Jo to his mom.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], x</ref>\n\nAt their wedding, Jo and Alex ignored the superstitions and went to a private place together to have pre-wedding sex and found themselves in a shed. They then got locked in the shed and couldn't get out until [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] and [[Andrew DeLuca|Andrew]] found them. At this point, Jo and Alex were late to their own wedding and they had to move locations because the wedding planner had an allergic reaction and there was blood all over everything. They all got on a ferry boat, and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] suggested Jo and Alex get married on the ferry, with Meredith officiating.<ref>[[All of Me]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Jo visited her birth mother and found out the truth about her father, she fell into a depressive state. Alex stayed by her side, helping her at therapy. She hated the fact that she was another one of his crazy women, and said that they weren't even married, which gave him an out. However, Alex told her later that he didn't want an out. He wanted to marry her again. They got remarried on Halloween.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], x</ref>\n\nWhen Alex disappeared to Iowa to visit his mother, Jo began to worry, as he wasn't responding to any of her texts or calls. He was supposedly dealing with something, but Jo worried that he was getting revenge for when she needed time, even though she knew he would never do that. While operating on a patient whose wife cheated on him, she started to think that maybe Alex was cheating on her. [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] told her that it had taken him and Teddy, like Jo and Alex, a long time to get where they were, and he wasn't going to screw that up for anything. He reassured her that Alex wouldn't, either.\n\nShe feared that he left her for good after calling his mom and finding out that Alex had never gone to Iowa. Shortly after that, she got a letter from him saying that he had reconnected with his ex-wife, Izzie (now a successful surgical oncologist) and had been living in Kansas with her and their two children, Alexis and Eli. He revealed that he had never fallen out of love with Izzie, and realized that her having their kids was everything he needed to go back to her. He told Jo that he would not be returning to Seattle and left her divorce papers.<ref>[[Leave a Light On]], x</ref>\n\n\n[[Levi Schmitt]]\nJo had a one-night stand with Levi after he came to the bar to apologize to her.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], x</ref>\n\nHe later returned her badge to her, which embarrassed her. When he came to her later about a potential donor he had found, she took the case from him, upsetting him.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], x</ref>\n\nAfter finding out from [[Olivia Jankovic]] that [[Alex Karev|Alex]] had had syphilis in the past, he was worried he should get himself checked. Jo assured him she didn't have syphilis.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], x</ref>\n\nAfter Levi came out as gay and after he broke up with Nico and Jo was left by Alex she invited Levi to move in with her.<ref>[[Love of My Life]], x</ref> The two established a close friendship.<ref>[[Sing It Again]], x</ref>\n\n[[Atticus Lincoln]]\nLink and Jo have known each other since they were undergrads. They waited tables at Jimmy's Crab Shack together. They describe themselves as being like brother and sister. When a girlfriend of his broke up with him, he was distraught and Jo came by his place to spend time with him even though he wanted to be alone. She insisted on staying and did his laundry for him. Her company helped him through that rough patch and he returned the favor when she returned from meeting her mother.\n\n[[Stephanie Edwards]]\nJo and Stephanie had a strong friendship that developed throughout their residency, and were there for each other through their hardest times. Jo helped Stephanie get through [[April and Jackson's Wedding|Jackson leaving her for April]], and Stephanie helped Jo when Alex and Jo broke up. Jo was devastated when Stephanie quit her job after the hospital fire. She attempted to fill the hole Stephanie left with [[Ben Warren]].\n\n[[Meredith Grey]]\nWhen Meredith was publishing her abdominal wall transplant, she wanted to put Jo's name on the paper, but she also needed a picture, and Jo couldn't give a picture because then [[Paul Stadler|Paul]] would find her, so she asked Meredith to take her name off of the article. From that point on, Meredith was very protective of Jo and was even nice to her when [[Alex Karev|Alex]] asked. Then when Paul surprised Jo at the hospital, Meredith was there to comfort her and to keep her safe from Paul. She comforted her by saying \"You're Jo Wilson. I know exactly who you are.\" Meredith kept Alex from Paul, so Alex didn't kill him, and Meredith sat with Jo while she was signing the divorce papers. She also protected her when Paul came back and was threatening Jo for talking to Jenny, Meredith \"called security\" even though the phones weren't working. After that, when Meredith was dealing with the mini spleens in [[Judy Kemp]], Jo wished that a mini-spleen situation would happen for a useful organ, which gave Meredith the idea for her contest entry: mini livers. Since Jo helped find an important piece, she put Jo as her partner for the contest, and they created their mini livers together. After Jo's return to the hospital, Meredith has taken on a sisterly role to Jo, helping her out whenever she needs help.\n\n\nDr. Wilson graduated cum laude from Princeton University and [[Harvard Medical School]]. She obtained a spot at the most wanted [[Resident|residency-match]], [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital|Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's]] [[General Surgery|surgical program]].\n\nDr. Wilson was named by [[Meredith Grey]] as the most promising [[Internship|intern]] and was thus awarded the first surgery of the rotation, which is in fact given to interns they think will fail. As expected, she did fail to complete the surgery and while crying about it, [[Owen Hunt|Dr. Owen Hunt]] informed her that it was an exercise meant to be a learning experience. The surgery is \"designed\" for the chosen intern to fail to set an example for the other interns.\n\nWhen [[Richard Webber]] asked Meredith to choose one of the [[Resident|residents]] to assist with the surgery on him, Jo Wilson was selected.\n\nAfter assisting [[Callie Torres|Dr. Torres]] in a surgery, Jo was caught in the backlash as Callie was [[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word|sued for malpractice]].\n\nWhen a patient in the E.R. broke his arm due to a tetanic contraction, Jo scrubbed in with Callie on his fracture repair. She discovered a love of [[Orthopedic Surgery|ortho]] and has since been scrubbing in with Callie often.\n\nDuring Jo's fifth-year of residency, she has been chosen as [[Resident#Chief Resident|Chief Resident]]. Since Callie's departure, she has been showing an interest in [[General Surgery|general surgery]] and has been scrubbing in with Meredith often. Her interest in general surgery has also led her to closely work with Meredith in the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]].\n\nTowards the end of her fifth-year, [[Massachusetts General Hospital|MassGen]] offered Jo a minimally-invasive surgery fellowship.

When Joyce woke up in the morning, she discovered that Jada and Shanice were both missing. She traded Jada's phone down by the water, but then the signal went dead, making her think whoever had taken her had thrown her phone in the water. She then tracked Jada's fitness watch, which led to a house at th Avenue and Newland. She knocked on the door, but [[Robert Corson|Bob Corson]] slammed the door in her face. So she yelled for help and drew the attention of Dean, Travis, and Vic, who were at [[Maya and Carina's Apartment|Maya's place]] for a post-fire celebration. She explained to them what had happened and asked for help getting her daughter out of the house. She had called the police, but they never came to her house like they said they would. She went to the station, where she filed a report, but they told her it could take days to get a warrant, so she came to the house herself. Three Black girls had disappeared from her neighborhood in the last year and the police had done nothing. She'd been unable to reach [[Sharon (Season )|Sharon]], Shanice's mom, so Vic suggested calling her again and then contacting all the girls' friends to check social media. Joyce started making calls to all their friends, but no one had seen them. Frustrated, Dean decided to go to the door and knock. Bob again denied having the girls in his house. Dean wanted to pretend he smelled a gas leak to get access to the house, but Maya stopped him and called the police herself.\n\nPolice arrived soon afterward, but they said they were there not in response to Joyce and Maya's calls, but because Bob had reported trespassers. They refused to help Joyce find her daughter, so Dean again said he smelled gas and the other firefighters agreed they smelled it as well. They knocked on the door, but Bob denied them access to check it out. But a few minutes later, they heard glass breaking and saw that a fire had burst out a basement window. Bob came out of the house coughing. Sullivan and Dean then went into the house in search of the girls. They found them and brought them out, but Bob claimed the girls were lying and had broken into his house. When Shanice admitted that they'd started the fire to lure rescue, the cops accused Shanice and Jada of lying. When Joyce heard this, she lunged at [[Officer Schneider]], but Maya held her back. Despite this, Schneider arrested her. In the ensuing chaos, Dean and Sullivan were also arrested unjustly. The three were then loaded into cop cars and driven away while Jada and Shanice were taken to the hospital. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\nHer daughter's doctor, [[Jackson Avery]], posted bail for Joyce upon hearing the full story. He had her brought to Jada's room at Grey Sloan, where they were reunited. ''(\"[[No Time for Despair]]\")''\n\nDean sued the police department in response to what happened to him and to Joyce. When they offered a settlement, Joyce said she wanted to take it and Dean decided to agree to the settlement, knowing it would help Joyce more than continuing the lawsuit.

Her husband was said to be in Nevada to see his mother, who had been refusing to wear her mask in public.\n\n\nWhen her daughter disappeared in the middle of the night, she tracked her and helped aid in her safe recovery.\n\n\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nSxJoyceWilliams.png|[[Out of Control]]\nxJoyceWilliams.png|[[No Time for Despair]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nSx-.jpg\nx-.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n{{Joyce Williams Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Joyce}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:S Characters]]\n[[Category:S S Characters]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.

She remembers her childhood fondly. She had a large play set in the backyard and her mom took her to the beach and did cartwheels. She had a huge room with a TV. Her mom made casseroles.\n\n\nKristen was serving  to life in prison when she learned that her baby had a TRAP sequence, meaning that her baby had an acardiac twin putting pressure on her system by requiring her to pump blood to two bodies. With the help of her lawyer, [[Amanda Joseph]], she went to court to get doctors brought in from outside, including fetal surgeon [[Arizona Robbins]], to treat her. When they arrived, she believed they'd be delivering her baby, but she was informed that they were not and were instead doing a procedure to separate the blood vessels connecting her baby to the mass, after which she'd continue her pregnancy. She attacked [[Dominique Eldredge]] for refusing to give her more food, which resulted in her being put into four-point restraints. She was then examined.\n\nBecause the baby was hiding the blood vessels Arizona needed to access to separate the mass from the baby, she had to push on Kristen's belly to move her out of the way. During this process, she talked to Kristen to distract her from the pain, telling her about being away from her own daughter, which Jo confirmed was the truth. When Arizona was called away, Jo finished the repositioning and then Arizona started the procedure. Jo told Kristen about her past, and Kristen told her about her own childhood, and that she was naming her daughter Ellie. During the procedure, Kristen sensed that there was something they weren't telling her and began to panic. Despite Arizona's warning that she needed to stay still, she moved around, which caused her water to break and labor to start. She was told that her mother wasn't coming and wouldn't be bringing the baby to see her after she was born. Despite this, they coached her through labor. She initially refused to look at the baby and just told them to take her away, but when she heard the baby crying, she asked to hold her. She held her for a few minutes and told her to be good before handing her over to be adopted by her mother.\n\n\n\nShe says her mother was a great mom, baking award-winning casseroles and taking her to the beach and sending her to an all-girls private school. Despite this, at some point, she did something for which she was sent to prison. Since she was pregnant, she made arrangements for her mother to adopt the baby. She was devastated to learn that her mother had no plans to see her again and would not be bringing the baby to see her either.\n\n\nShe gets along well with her lawyer, [[Amanda Joseph]].

She was the result of a one-night stand her mother had following her divorce. After she was born, she wasn't breathing or moving, so she was quickly intubated and then taken to the NICU, where she was stable. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nAfter her birth, Luna was put on a ventilator as she continued to grow and develop. Her mother spoke to her over the phone as much as she was able to. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nLuna developed a bronchogenic cyst, which required surgery to remove. When they told Val that Luna needed surgery, she was upset because Luna had not been able to be held in her whole life and she was worried Luna was scared and confused. Jo promise she'd bring Luna to see her before her surgery, but before she could, Val coded and eventually died while Luna was in surgery. Luna's surgery went well and she was stable in the NICU afterward. Jo sat with her and held her hand. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\nJo continued visiting Luna in the NICU and holding her. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nBailey and Cormac also began visiting Luna and talking to her about the outside world. Jo became convinced she was reacting to the sound of her own name. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\nInspired by a patient telling his great-granddaughter the story of her family, Jo visited Luna in the NICU and told her about her mother and how every time Jo entered the ER, she thought of Val and of Luna. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\nThe weeks she'd spent intubated left Luna with very little gag reflex. She started spitting up after every feed and experienced drops in her heart rate each time. Her newly-assigned legal guardian, [[Carmen Delgado]], came to the hospital to check on her and Cormac told Carmen he was going to run labs to confirm a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. A week later, the diagnosis was confirmed, so they tried sitting her upright for feedings and giving her smaller amounts more frequently. When her condition worsened, Cormac proposed a Nissen fundoplication to stop the reflux. However, her social worker and legal guardian would not consent to the surgery. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nLater, Carmen changed her mind and allowed Luna to have the surgery, which went well. When Carmen mentioned that she had a family in mind who wanted to foster to adopt Luna, Jo decided she needed to get a lawyer and fight for custody of Luna. She had Link and Amelia temporarily foster Luna while she worked with the lawyer to get her record cleared and her adoption approved, to keep anyone else from adopting her. Finally, in April , Jo was able to take Luna home with her. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n\nOn the day she was supposed to return to work, Jo took Luna to the hospital. However, she ended up spending the entire day in the hospital parking lot, unable to take Luna in to the daycare. She worried Luna was feeling the same sense of abandonment Jo felt when her mother left her at the fire station as an infant. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nDespite this initial hiccup, Luna did eventually start attending the daycare while her mother worked. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Luna went to a small celebration in the hospital cafeteria with her mom, Nico, Levi, Richard, and Bailey. ''(\"[[Everyday Is a Holiday (With You)]]\")''\n\n\nWanting to give Luna all the experiences she never got to have, Jo planned to take Luna to fairytale theater in the park with Link and Scout. As they arrived at the park, she started explaining everything to Luna, saying she'd read that talking to your baby was important. They watched as the show started. One of the stories, Rapunzel, was interrupted when the actor playing the prince, [[Jeremy (Today Was a Fairytale)|Jeremy]], had a sudden cardiac episode and fell. Jo and Link rushed to his aid. Luna started fussing, so Jo had one of the actors move her closer and talked to her while she worked. When [[Janice (Today Was a Fairytale)|Janice]] started singing Someday My Prince Will Come to her, Jo said she wasn't sure that was the message she wanted for Luna, but thanked her. Luna later went with Jo to the hospital to follow up on Jeremy. ''(\"[[Today Was a Fairytale]]\")''\n\n\nJo took Luna to the park for a play date with [[Pruitt Arike Miller|Pru]]. ''(\"[[Wasn't Expecting That]]\")''\n\n\nOn Halloween, Jo took Luna trick or treating at the hospital. She wore a dog costume. ''(\"[[Haunted]]\")''\n\n\n\nHer birth mother, Val, wanted a child for a long time before she was born. When she found out she was pregnant, even though she was at high risk for bleeding, she was happy. Not long after she was born, her father signed over his rights to her, then her mother died. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")'' After Val died, Jo began spending more time with Luna and eventually adopted her.

They took her in for what should have been a straight-forward tumor resection, but when they got in there, they realized the tumor had grown quickly, wrapping around her heart and making their scans useless. They did a temporary abdominal closure and got new scans so they could develop a new surgical plan. When they saw that scans weren't enough, they printed a D rendering of the tumor to help them visualize the anatomy. With that, they began to develop a new surgical plan. However, while they were developing their new plan, Adrian started bleeding, so she had to be taken back into surgery immediately. They followed the plan they had developed up to the point where they hadn't planned anymore and then they had to make up a plan as they operated. They did so successfully and removed the whole tumor.\n\n\n\nMichael is married to [[Adrian Nelson]].

Casey said she did, but that his fever was still above , which it had been for over a week. Jo tried to assure her that it was a virus and that it was normal for the fever to last more than  days. Casey then pulled out a bunch of papers, saying she did some online research. Jo rapidly looked at them, but didn't seem convinced. Casey told her she knew her son and that she was sure it wasn't a virus. Jo then agreed to give them a chart.\n\nMeanwhile, Casey accosted Meredith, giving her some names of illnesses she found on the Internet. Jo then came over and told them it was strep, giving them a prescription for amoxicillin. Casey was relieved it wasn't a virus and left with Parker.\n\nHowever, some time later, Casey returned to the ER with her son. She told a nurse the fever was getting higher, which didn't make any sense. When Jo came to talk to her, Casey said it wasn't strep and that whatever Jo prescribed wasn't helping. Jo tried to calm her down, saying the meds would take  hours to work, but Casey said that he wouldn't have gotten worse if they did. Casey said Jo was dismissing them, just like the doctors at\ua[[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]]\uaand Urgent Care. Jo looked startled and asked her if she really had been to all those hospitals. Casey said she did, but that she wanted another doctor because Jo either didn't believe her or she didn't care about her son.\n\nAfter that, Jo got a psychiatrist to talk to Casey. She started screaming at Jo about her thinking she was crazy. She desperately told them that her son didn't do anything anymore, when Meredith overheard her talking. She came over and told Casey she believed her. She told Jo to admit Parker.\n\nIn his room, Meredith said his [[Computed Tomography|CT]] was completely normal. Meredith then patiently overheard all of Casey's research, but none of them seemed to be the one. Meredith said she couldn't come up with anything other than strep, but Casey replied he should've gotten better if it was. Meredith said she'd do some more tests.\n\n\nThe morning after, Meredith told Casey she couldn't find anything else than the strep, that he wasn't surgical, and that his labs kept coming back clean. Casey insisted she had a feeling that something was seriously wrong with her son.\n\nRight before discharging Parker, Meredith and Jo went through Parker's labs one last time. Suddenly, the labs were updated. The previous day's strep test was a false positive. Meredith then realized Parker had Kawasaki disease. She checked her calendar to look if ten days had passed since the fever started. It turned out to be the tenth day. Meredith then ran over to Parker's room to check if he had red eyes.\n\nAfter she found out he did, she told Jo to page peds and cardio and to start IVIG. She told Casey that Parker had Kawasaki disease and it was the last day they would be able to prevent permanent heart damage.\n\nIn the evening, Meredith showed Casey her son's echo. She informed her that the IVIG would fix the fluid around his heart. She added that Parker would need another echo in six months and after showing Casey's note on Kawasaki disease, she smilingly told Casey that she had fought for her son and saved his life. Meredith later walked by their room, where Parker showed his mother a drawing with crayons he made for her.\n\n\n\n[[Casey Hedges]]\nParker's mother, Casey, was highly concerned about his illness.

At Joe's, Jo told him and Link that Bailey had begged her to come back to general surgery. She was torn between her passion for OB/GYN and wanted to honor Bailey. Todd suggested that she could do both, doing her residency during the day and moonlighting in general surgery. Link offered to help with Luna to facilitate this.

She knew she didn't have Covid, she said, because she hadn't gone anywhere or seen anyone. Jo told her in the ER that her abdominal pain was due to pregnancy, so she was moved into a room. Carina did an ultrasound, which showed an empty uterus, so they started looking for other causes for the positive pregnancy test. They did a CT, which showed a fetus growing near her liver. She was told she was about  weeks along. Carina asked her if she wanted the baby. When she said she did, they told her her baby would need to be delivered right away, as waiting carried the risk of catastrophic bleeding from her liver. They took her into surgery, where Carina did a C-section. Her baby, whom she named Luna, was intubated and then taken to the NICU. Val's liver started bleeding, forcing them to remove one of the lobes, putting Val at risk for liver failure, but stopping the bleeding. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nVal was still in the hospital after her partial liver resection. She had concerned labs, so Jo ordered a CT, which showed a pseudoaneurysm, which required surgery. Val was upset with having to see her daughter only on a phone screen, but Jo explained that neither of them was stable enough to visit the other. Val begged Jo to help make parenthood real for her. After Val's surgery, Jo suspected she might still end up needing a transplant since they'd had to remove so much of her liver. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nTwo days after her surgery, Val was severely jaundiced and septic. She struggled with not being able to see Luna, worried that she was scared and alone. She tried to convince Jo that she was healthy enough to go see Luna, but Jo knew she was lying. Jo ordered a CT and labs, which showed that her liver was failing, so she ordered liver dialysis. Despite this, Val later coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n\n\nShe is divorced. She and her ex-husband tried conceiving for eight years, including six rounds of IVF. He blamed her for every failed cycle, asking what she should have done differently. They grew to hate each other and so divorced. She then had a one-night stand with a man who rented their back room and became pregnant, leading her to understand that it was never her fault.\n\n\nHer daughter, Luna, was born at  weeks' gestation after growing on her liver instead of in her uterus. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")'' Shortly after Luna's birth, Val contacted Newman and told him about her. He wished her luck, but signed over his parental rights, leaving Val as Luna's sole parent.

She admitted she had run the stop sign, but because she was pregnant, she needed every dollar she could save to help pay for that. In the security line at the courthouse, she met Alex, who noticed a rash on her hands. He told her he worked at a free clinic and recommended that she get the rash checked out.\n\n\nLater that day, Veronica came to the clinic and Alex examined her. In addition to the rash, he also noticed yellow in the whites of her eyes, indicating jaundice, and she noted that she'd lost weight despite being sixteen weeks pregnant. Suspecting that she had pancreatic cancer, Alex insisted that she get a surgical consult from Bailey. Bailey ran tests and confirmed Alex's suspicions. She had advanced pancreatic cancer and needed to start treatment immediately.\n\nVeronica was told that Bailey recommended termination so she could start chemotherapy the next day. Veronica resisted, because even with treatment, she only had less than a year to live. However, without treatment, she wouldn't live long enough to have a healthy baby. Alex suggested a Whipple, which would remove the bulk of the tumor, which could buy her enough time to deliver a healthy baby. Bailey refused, but when Veronica talked to her about seeing images of the baby growing up with Jeremy and not seeing those when she went the way Bailey was suggesting, Bailey agreed to do the surgery.\n\nThe surgery went well and they hoped it would buy her enough time. However, she was still terminal herself. ''(\"[[Roar]]\")''\n\n\nWhen she was  weeks and  days pregnant, Veronica came back to the hospital with back pain, which she'd had for a week.

Arizona easily delivered her baby, but she developed a clot that went to her lung and she struggled to breathe after the delivery. They said she could rescind her DNR, but she said she was tired and so they just stayed with her while she died. After she was gone, Alex told Jeremy about her death and he cried.

She bought pills that were laced with something that caused massive overdoses. When she overdosed, she was separated from her son Truman. At the hospital, she searched for him, hoping someone had seen him at the park and taken him to the hospital. The doctors tried to calm her down, believing her stress was the reason for her high blood pressure. When [[Ralph Tennyson]] came into the ER, bringing her son, Truman, he also informed the doctors that Wendy had been using drugs.\n\nThe doctors called her husband and he came to the hospital to pick up Truman. He was upset that he hadn't noticed that his wife had gotten hooked on drugs after taking someone else's leftover pain medication. She was quickly arrested. Alex advised Stuart to keep their son away from her and protect him.\n\n\n\nShe is married to [[Stuart Cole]].\n\n\nShe and her husband have a son named [[Truman Cole]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cole, Wendy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete": "", "warnings": {"main": {"*": "Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes."}, "revisions": {"*": "Because \"rvslots\" was not specified, a legacy format has been used for the output.
