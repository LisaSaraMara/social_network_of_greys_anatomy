His co-worker took him and his arm to the hospital, where they stabilized him and then moved him to an operating room to re-attach his arm. Unfortunately, before they could start, Colin coded. They were able to save him, but he was too unstable to survive the long surgery required to save his arm. They moved him to the ICU, but then Owen had the idea to use an experimental military procedure, ex-vivo limb perfusion, to keep the arm alive until he was stable enough to re-attach it.\n\nLater that day, his wife, [[Lucy Renfield]], was told he'd have surgery to re-attach his arm the following morning.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Lucy Renfield]].\n\n==Career==\nHe works at an e-tail fulfillment center.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Renfield, Colin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}]}}}}
