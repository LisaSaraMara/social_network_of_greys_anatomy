Molly had been texting her and was on her way out, but had stopped, so she asked [[Dean Miller]] if he knew where she'd gone. He didn't, so she continued to wait outside for her daughter. Once Denise saw Molly on a gurney outside the building, she was relieved. As they put her in the Aid Car to take her to the hospital, she hugged Ben and thanked him. Then she followed them to the hospital.\n\nDenise waited in the waiting room while Molly was being treated. She talked to Ben about Molly while she waited. Just after Ben got news about Travis, Bailey came out and had to tell Denise that Molly hadn't made it.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe was very close with her daughter Molly until Molly's death.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Denise}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S2 Characters]]"}]}}}}
