Hank's sister, Wynnie, drove them to the hospital in their van with only a learner's permit. In the ER, they learned that while Cheryl had only cuts and bruises on her hand, Doug had a serious head injury because Cheryl had been wearing the only helmet. She said she didn't even like the motorcycle, but she liked seeing Doug in the garage with it and it stirred up feelings. While her hands were bandaged, Doug was taken into surgery to treat a brain bleed. After his surgery, he was expected to recover fully and said he'd be getting rid of the motorcycle.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe came to the hospital with his sister and parents when his parents crashed their dad's motorcycle.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He wanted to keep the dog they almost hit, but his mom told him he couldn't.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Giles, Hank}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]"}]}}}}
