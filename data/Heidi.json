Meredith determined that she was definitely not in labor and the baby was stable. Labs revealed that she was in liver failure. Heidi was advised that without a transplant, Brie's liver might not last 72 hours. She was immediately put on the transplant list.\n\nA liver became available and [[Meredith Grey]] and [[Shane Ross]] went to retrieve it. While retrieving it, Shane accidentally cut the hepatic artery and the hilum, rendering it useless for transplant. Brie was returned to the transplant list and Heidi was advised that if things got worse, they might have to perform a C-section to deliver the baby.\n\nA second liver became available, but a mass was discovered. They had it biopsied and it was thankfully benign, so the transplant went on as planned following the c-section delivery of the baby.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Brie]]. They have one child together.\n\n===Familial===\nWhile her wife was in surgery to receive a liver transplant, their child was delivered.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She babbles when she's nervous.\n*She was determined to look better than the baby in their pictures.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}]}}}}
