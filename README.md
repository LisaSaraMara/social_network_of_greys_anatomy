In the context of social network and text analysis and due to our excitement for the show Grey's Anatomy and its popularity, we decided to analyze what is more important in the relationships or the medical work. Our analysis can be found in the Network and topic analysis of Grey's Anatomy report and the notebooks provide the technical steps of the project.
